Or reach out to alumni from your program or your advisor's past students. Then you can follow their paths. \n3. Does your university have a career counseling center? They can give you support and advices.\n4. Does your university have free mental health services? When facing difficult transitions or career decisions, I find it helpful to talk to a counselor/therapist to explore values, figure out what you want out of life, and why your current situation is not working.

After all, trying to find answers is our job, because we don't know the answers and oftentimes nobody knows them. How can we feel confident and knowledgeable in a situation like that? \n\nSo, I don't think that not feeling confident and knowledgeable makes you an impostor.

It's when you admit that you don't know that you go after answers, and do your research. \n\nI struggle hard, but I also have seen a lot of amazing professors here struggling hard too. They also have a hard time solving a problem in class. They often tell us they don't know something important. They also need to stop and think for a long time when a student asks a hard question. \n\nIt's not like the professors have all the knowledge, and give that knowledge to us. Often, they also don't have the knowledge, and we go after that knowledge together. \n\nAnd we are exposed to so much knowledge, that nobody can handle all of that. An important part of my journey has been to identify what I know (very little), what I don't know but I may be able to eventually know (and that helps me to decide the kind of research I will do), and what I don't know and probably will never be able to know (most of the things I have seen here). \n\nIf you are \"confident that everything is doable\", you have much more confidence than I do.

The timeline to apply to the US is take GRE/TOEFL etc anytime before October so that scores are available for December. As most US Biology programs have a December deadline for PhD Programs staring next year\u2019s Fall. Then they contact you about Feb to conduct Skype interviews and you get an offer in end Feb or early March. So if you have you heart set on US, take a gap year do some job and apply for the next cycle.\n2) As far as funding, most US PhD prof and will come with a stipend and tuition waivers. You May have to TA if your PI doesn\u2019t have a lot of funds available. In some places in Canada however, international students don\u2019t get a tuition waiver and you have to save from your stipend to pay the tuition. I\u2019m not sure about EU. But I interviewed at Max Planck and their stipend was competitive but not fixed. Apparently you have to negotiate that with PI. In US/Canada the amount will be fixed. \n3) From personal experience, don\u2019t go by country. Different countries have a whole different way of training a graduate student and you have to find one that suits you. Eg. in US most places will offer you 3-4 rotations and then you pick a lab. In Canada/EU which lab and PI you\u2019ll work with will be predetermined. In Japan, I think OIST offers rotations but not all other places. \nI went to a big name institution India where internships abroad and grad school abroad was a common thing to do so I do have classmates scattered in Canada/EU/Japan.

I also didn't think that a PhD would be like a job until I really started to get more information about it. \n\nFor example, if they believe that a PhD is just an advanced version of a bachelor's degree, then it's just natural to think it's not a real job, not prestigious, etc. It's a wrong belief they have, based on wrong assumptions. \n\nIn a situation like this, I still think it's worth explaining why a PhD is a job. Not only for myself, but to help people understand, and that understanding can even help other people. \n\nTelling them to try to understand one of my papers doesn't really sound like a good strategy.

I'm very happy with my decision and I'm doing well both academically and mentally. Here's my advice:\n\n* Like a lot of people are saying in this thread, make sure you both want and need (as in won't get the job you want) a PhD before you go into it. If you DO decide you want and need it, you can do it but approach it carefully.\n* First, what do you want from a PhD? Don't shoot for the hyper-competitive, high-pressure top-tier programs unless you need that to get the job you want.\n* Advisors are, as it's often mentioned, the thing that makes or breaks a program for people, but this will probably be even more crucial for you. Be VERY selective when you're looking at advisors. Do they respond to your email in a reasonable timeframe when you email them about your interest in their lab? Do they seem courteous to you? Can you see contact info for their students (if not they might be trying to keep prospectives from reaching out to current students)? Do their students *graduate on time* (Check student CVs to see if they're progressing on track or not)? Feeling lost and unsupported is a one-way ticket to worsening mental health. Thoroughly looking into potential advisors can help avoid this. \n* Reach out to students at the programs you're interested in and ask them about their experience. Try to get people who are starting and people who are later in their PhDs as well. Listen to what they say, and what they don't say. If they say something's good, it usually is. If they don't say anything, it's a toss up. If they say something is bad, assume it is awful and think about whether you can deal.  The most productive questions I found were asking students 1) what they wished they'd known before they started their PhD and 2) what, if anything, about the school/department surprised them during their first year of the program. \n* If you can visit the school and get together with a group of students, watch how they interact. Do they seem at ease? Competitive? This can tell you a lot about the program culture.\n* If you have contacts in academia from undergrad, ask them their honest opinions about the departments and advisors you're considering. They'll usually be blunt if they're off the record. Listening to my undergrad mentors led me to my advisor, and I'm glad I listened.\n* Do not do a PhD without funding if you're in the US. Yes, in some fields this is fine. Yes, this is a horse that is beaten to death on grad school subreddits. But you need to think about the stress you'll be under and how to minimize it. You will be under a boatload of financial stress even with a stipend, on top of PhD stress. If you are without a stipend, it will be worse.\n* If you get in, get in counselling ASAP if you aren't already. Do not wait until you're hurting to get help.\n* Remember that quitting is always an option. Always. \n\nGood luck.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ez1i5q/would_you_recommend_a_phd_for_someone_with/fgnx5lq/"}, "301": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Chaucers_Mistress", "Date": 1580954877, "Score": 7, "Body": "Do you need the degree to start?

That is going to be an older experienced member of that field.  I am not saying that always happens.\n\nI'm sure there are cases where a PI has some of their students write portions of a review and includes them as authors or perhaps even has a student write the review and then edits or vets it themselves before publishing, but that is not the purpose of a review and would be some sort of favor, not a right that student should expect.\n\nThe purpose of a review is not to just have an opportunity for students to get authorships.  Saying \"well I know this person who got to do that\" doesn't change that. Perhaps you wanted to be an author and are sad that you weren't offered the opportunity or that someone else was...but you have no claim here. The review containing work that you produced and published has no bearing on whether or not you should be an author, clearly a review has literally hundreds of papers cited with work from likely thousands of people within it.

If you truly want to be involved in a review of a topic you could take that initiative with your supervisor and state that if he gets a request for a book chapter or a review on a topic you are involved in whether he would consider allowing you to do the lit review and writeup for a chance at an authorship.  That would be a perfect legit way to do it, but if you want authorship like that you have to be proactive...not just wait for it to happen to fall into your lap...because no journal or book publisher is going to write you directly and ask you to provide a review it is always going to be the favor of a more senior member who is asked.  \n\n\nOften the way it happens, in my experience, is a book publisher or journal reaches out to your supervisor as a member of the field and asks them if they would like to provide a book chapter or review.  Usually a PI is going to say yes because it is an opportunity to raise their status and the exposure their lab gets.  But, also often, a PI is going to be slammed and feel like they don't have time to do a full lit review...so they might look around to see if anyone else might be able to do it.

Another person to ask is the college's registrar, who handles academic records.\n\nAt my local CC, retaking classes to replace a lower grade is only allowed for noncredit grades (D, F, withdraw, etc). So some students, upon getting a B or C, will try to outright fail the final or ask the professor to grant them an F in order to retake the class next term for an A, replacing the failing grade. However, many professors frown on this practice.\n\nI'm not an administrator or faculty member, so I don't know the exact reasoning behind this policy, but from my imagination:\n\n1. If students have an unlimited (given sufficient money) attempts to get an A in a course, the value of an A goes down, because while some people will get an A the first time, others may spend multiple terms (possibly years) to get that same A, and it will appear the same on a transcript. It's similar to allowing students unlimited attempts on an exam if they have the money to pay for it. (For admissions, institutions can demand all attempts of the GRE, SAT, MCAT, etc. to see if you are retaking them an absurd number of times).\n\n2. More broadly, if the above happens, then you will have GPA inflation. Some people will have 4.00 (or whatever high GPA) in the current system of taking their classes once, while others may have 4.00 from retaking their classes many times. The GPA will no longer indicate academic competitiveness.\n\n3. The institution wants students to transfer (CC) or graduate (4 year institution) because it reflects well on them.

I didn't know how to tell him so I ended up drafting a letter to me committee explaining my proposed plan for graduation and emailed my advisor out of nowhere to 'review it for me before I send it'.

So this kinda shook him to the core and ended up agreeing to my terms (GTFO, strip my project down to bare bones to get me out ASAP, papers or no papers, purely technical thesis). That letter to the committee ended up forgotten lol (I did talk to them individually before the last meeting and made sure they were on board which also wasn't difficult.

It was a beautiful green campus instead of a concrete jungle.  It was relatively social students who seemed relaxed and happy. It was a town that offered things I like to do and a lifestyle I like, such as the option to commute by bike or foot. There were young, healthy people everywhere I looked. When I interacted with the local people in the shops and streets, they were friendly. There was no one kind of style - people just wore whatever they liked, preppy or hipster or whatever.

Grad school is really friggin hard, and these things make it bearable or, dare I even say *enjoyable*?\n\nNow that's all well and good, but this school had its many drawbacks, too. In hindsight, I'm glad I chose lifestyle over prestige.  I wanted to do neuroscience. Now I do cognition, but I found a way to collaborate with the neuro lab.

I came into a lab that everyone else was graduating from, so I'm flying solo, but that's because my advisor managed to get people through their Ph.D.'s early.

Finding the program that fits your research interests is usually a huge part of applications, at least for top Marketing PhD programs in the US (things may be quite different for lower-ranked programs or other countries).\n\nAlso, the answer depends on what kind of research you are doing. For example, things in Consumer Behavior - CB are very different from Quantitative Marketing (the two main concentrations for Marketing PhD). And in Quantitative Marketing, some researchers are more on the theoretical side, while others are more on the empirical side, also affecting how we choose a research topic.\n\nFor example, if you are a CB student, gaps in marketing theory are probably a priority for you. Reading papers from sources like the Journal of Consumer Research should help.\n\nHowever, if you are closer to Marketing Strategy, external validity and relevance for the industry are more important than the theoretical gap. In this case, reading the news or talking to marketing managers are some ways to think of a research topic.\n\nIf your research is more focused on data analysis, then your research topic really depends on what data is available for you, or what data you think you can get. If you have an amazing topic, but no data, you can't do anything for this kind of research.\n\nAlso, the gap may not be related to the topic. For example, your contribution may be a new method for an old topic, like a new and improved statistical procedure for market segmentation.\n\nFor most of us, we start to think about that kind of thing before applying to a PhD, because we need to choose the program that is suited for our interests. My program attracts a lot of Marketing applicants who have sales management as their topic of interest, since we have one of the top researchers in that field.\n\nIf you think in very general terms, probably any research topic is \"overdone\". There is a lot of research about online marketing, for example. But that doesn't mean that there aren't gaps when you get into specific parts of online marketing. One example from the 2018-2020 research priorities defined by the Marketing Science Institute is the tradeoff between privacy and personalization in customer data collection.\n\nSo, it seems to me there is a long road ahead for you. You need to first think about your concentration (e.g., CB, or Quant), then the type of research you want to do (e.g., theoretical, empirical), your own motivations (you should get a topic that really motivates you, that you are curious/passionate about), your own goals (your topic of research can really influence your future job opportunities), the resources that your programs have. Without that, it's hard to tell if a topic is good or not.\n\nLet me give you an example of something in marketing research that is not overdone: genetic influence in salespeople's performance. Not many people are doing that, the only one I know is a professor from MIT.\n\nBut maybe you don't have the background/knowledge/interest in biology or something like that for a study involving DNA analysis. Maybe your program doesn't have the money to do DNA analysis. Maybe you find this topic boring, and not something that you'd like the make a career out of it. So, it doesn't make sense to look for a research topic in marketing without taking into consideration the context.\n\nAnd it's good to think why something is not overdone. Some possible reasons are that (i) the topic is not interesting or relevant, (ii) the topic is very new, (iii) there are some big obstacles to overcome in order to study that topic. All of them should be a concern if you find something that is not overdone. Otherwise, you may end up doing a study that nobody cares about the results or a study that is not feasible given your resources.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f25e9b/hii_have_recently_enrolled_for_phd_in_faculty_of/fhatl4f/"}, "666": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "muletaxistosa", "Date": 1581426751, "Score": 3, "Body": "1.

So, purely qualitative research is really something I don't know much about. So, I may be wrong about a lot of things. \n\nAbout that part that I mentioned. \n\n\\- A typical CB study is an experiment. Everything is under control, they change something (e.g., online information), and see what happens (e.g., the decision a consumer make). Since, they keep everything under control, it's much easier to conclude that the specific change in online information caused the change in consumer decision. So, this is very good for theoretical research. They find a gap in theory, and do an experiment to fill that gap.\n\n\\- A typical Marketing Strategy study is much more worried about the struggles that marketing managers face in real life. They may read the online news and see that T-Mobile's takeover of Sprint has been approved, and think \"Maybe T-Mobile and Sprint are worried about the impact of the news on their consumers?\", and start the research topic from there, without knowing anything about the literature or theory yet. This research will probably be more relevant for people who work in Marketing, but much weaker for the theoretical explanations. You usually can show what happened, but can't really be sure about why they happened. Consumer decisions after being exposed to that kind of online news can be influenced by lots of things, but you aren't in a lab experiment to be able to control all those factors.\n\nI don't think there is a book that can really get you through the entire process of any kind of research as done in academics. Each paper will have different processes. Even if you do two experiments about similar topics, the process can be quite different for each one. Depending on what you want to do, you will probably have to look for several different papers, and combine things they did before. \n\nIf your interest is to know the impact of online information on consumer decision, you can look for the literature about it (and probably there will be many kinds of online information and consumer decision) for a more theoretical approach, or look for how that affects real companies  for a more empirical approach.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f25e9b/hii_have_recently_enrolled_for_phd_in_faculty_of/fhdq5ld/"}, "724": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MC1R_", "Date": 1581496204, "Score": 3, "Body": "Well done!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f2h67e/i_passed_my_phd_today_thank_you_to_this_beautiful/fhdq8ln/"}, "725": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BlurryFaceeeeee", "Date": 1581497398, "Score": 3, "Body": "Congratulations Dr.coffeeislife.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f2h67e/i_passed_my_phd_today_thank_you_to_this_beautiful/fhdr3n9/"}, "726": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "apurvamywork", "Date": 1581497752, "Score": 1, "Body": "If you don't mind,  will you share some good books or resources that can give me good foundation for my PhD journey.

Now, your field of studies is a lot different from mine (Programming/CS engineering student here) so I don't understand pretty well the struggles you are having but here's my generalized opinion anyways:\n\nRegardless of what you do, try to imagine yourself as a world-renowned doctor who had been disproved or had been told that his research field is sh*t and don't imagine it only in your brain - analyze it as deep as you can. Try closing your eyes when you have free time and just daydreaming the seething rage within because the whole world pointed their fingers at you and told you \"xxxxx theory that you came up with is bullshit, it'll never be approved\", or anything that associates you with that kind of feeling, I'm not you so idk what will work out doe you but the important thing is to feel the emotion od rage. After you do, just let your mind flow and don't stop but be aware that you need time alone for yourself because the rage will manifest in reality as well and based on intensity you may or may not have the wish to break something or argue with someone.\n\nNow then, when your 'rage' buff is up, destroy the entire world or two in your mind and just imagine everything around you breaking as if it's an illusion and then imagine the exact moment and surroundings you're in IRL and reciprocate it within your mind, now pay good attention to what you feel after you release the pent-up emotions, if it's not emptiness you shall experiment a little more until you reach that moment of pure emptiness, after that try out as manydifferentt things as you can and don't stick to your particular field of studies, try physics astronomy programming 3d art 2d art writing novels writing songs play some games and then think about what makes you the happiest of all those things. When you find it, the next job is purely yours because there anyone can help very little - find a way to connect your field of studies and the thing that makes you happy.\n\nMy examples: CS student, math and physics ruined my will to live let alone pass them\nI began writing fantasy/martial arts novel (because i like that shit), I began analyzing in-depth how human brain works (wanna make AI based on the similar principle so ... Yeah i'm fucked with that one but i love it so why not)\nGames, anime and memes bring me up back from the hole called depression and then when i see something epic i have an overwhelming will to make something based on that Completely By Myself From Scratch, and suddenly, will to live skyrockets.\n\nIf you're wondering why tf this works for me, idk maybe i'm just special kind of retard but i'm feeling happy asf every day besides the depression strike in the morning so who gives a fuck literally\n\n\nAll in all --- make yourself happy with any way possible (wxcept drugs cuz they expensive af)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr - Adrenaline. Find a way to stimulate your adrenaline with only your brain yourself and you're pretty much good for a day.\nNow repeat this every day and there it is.\nAlso, the sleep problem - experiment with time for me 3 hours of sleep leave me in the worst state possible, 4 hours make me as energetic as one can be, everything above 6 hrs and i'm dead as if i never even slept.\n\n\nHope i helped, pardon typos i was on the phone ;)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f1f4t0/how_do_you_stay_motivated_when_you_know_you_wanna/fheod2m/"}, "758": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "cjberra", "Date": 1581526765, "Score": 7, "Body": "Nah the rest just get bigger, that's the beauty of pie charts", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f2rb5v/some_days_this_feels_more_accurate_than_others/fheoomg/"}, "759": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Oatkeeperz", "Date": 1581527109, "Score": 3, "Body": "If the scientific program is available, check that beforehand and mark the sessions/presentations/posters that sound interesting to you.

Read some of the abstracts beforehand and talk to the people who made the posters. Usually they're more than happy to talk to you.

Right now it sounds like you are waiting around for someone to give you something to do...and frankly they probably won't because they are focused on what they need to do and attempting to bring someone else in on it is often more work than not.\n\nI guess what I would suggest is you need to take some time to really evaluate what it is you wanted from a PhD program in the first place.

So I'd take stock of that, look around and see what is going on in that field...what equipment you have available to you and do some hard thinking on what you personally want to do.

I don't know if I'm commenting on this too late and you've already made up your mind. I also don't know if people have said this to you before either in person or here in the comments, but I'll say things that you already know. I might say things you don't want to hear. I'll say things that were said to me, since I was in the same situation as you. And honestly, some of the things that I'm saying here and that stuck with me came from people I highly respect. Because you and I don't have a connection, I honestly do not know if this will hit you as hard as it hit me.   \n\nI respect everyone on this subreddit, but I think that this is a decision that I don't think any of us commenting should be making for you so I don't want to say anything like: \"If X, then do Y.\" And again, I was in the same situation as you are right now, but this isn't about me. If you really are interested, DM me and I'm happy to share my email and tell you how my story went.\n\n1. You don't want to be responsible for the fate of your relationship if things don't work out in the long distance. That is ok, but if you really want something, you'll make it work, regardless of what that **something** is (either your relationship or your career). \n\n1. \"Honestly, it is **okay** to choose happiness.\" This came from an older mentor who had a lot more life experience, beyond just academics or work experience. This is the one that really stuck to me. \n\n1. In a few months/years, you may be a different person than who you are today. You may end up loving School A and may not be able to image a life in which you went to School B. But, in case things don't work out, you do not want to resent her for choosing School A. \n\n1. Putting yourselves in a position of long distance really is the test to see if your relationship is strong or not. If your relationship can survive long distance, under *normal* circumstances, your relationship will be able to sustain a whole lot of shit. Anormal circumstances would have to be things like the loss of a baby, or an abusive relationship, or any other shit that I personally don't consider normal. \n\n1. A long distance relationship is temporary. People go through war and \n\n1. Choosing where you go **may** help define where you end up next, which may influence whether you will have the flexibility of staying the same city as your SO in the future. But it also **may not**, given that you decide how hard to work, and how successful you can be in a program regardless of the ranking. \n\n\nYou, my friend, have the best type of problem. The problem where you have multiple possibilities, and you don't know which to choose. No matter what you choose, you will have to make some sort of sacrifice REGARDLESS. You need to decide which sacrifice can you make up for it. Can you make it work with long distance? Can you make your research work with fewer facilities/resources? \n\nThis was my unbiased part of my post. Now here is the opinionated part of my post. \n\nDude, if you found THE ONE, don't lose her, regardless of what decision you've made. This is a decision that must come with confidence. If you don't make a decision with confidence, you will always have doubts. Make sure you make a decision that will guarantee you some sort of happiness or satisfaction. (More of my story explains this, but again, this isn't about me). And dude, take it from someone who has been in 3 schools, in top notch schools as well as mediocre schools, the ranking/strength of a program can only bring some probable assurance. It does NOT mean you will have a good time at a top school, and it does NOT mean that you will have a better research. This is not one of those silly imposter syndrome cases; this is a realistic point of view when I say: the work that some people are doing in mediocre (or not well known) schools are many times far superior than what people are doing at top notch schools. Plus, a top notch school sometimes can have extremely bad advisors (I am totally not kidding about this). \n\nLast piece of advice: choose happiness. Choose whatever makes you happy where you can sacrifice on the other. This can be interpreted in many different ways, and honestly, my definition of happiness may be very different from another person. \n\nAgain, sorry for not being one of those who tell you what to do, but I don't think this is my or anyone's place. Be confident with what you choose, and take your consequent problems head on. All I hope is that your decision will bring you happiness.

Like it or not your boss is someone you have to work with.  It is, in my opinion, not a good idea to complain to the department that he got angry with you unless (A: you feel actually threatened, B: this is recurrent to the point where you have to quit their lab and want to start having a record of the times there were conflicts so that you can refer to that as explanation).\n\nHow could this possibly be a positive?  Sounds to me like your boss is annoyed/aggrevated because he viewed this conference as an excellent (and possible once in a graduate-career) chance for you to give an oral presentation and now that isn't going to happen.  So yes, it is shitty they chose to express this in terms of verbally accusing you of doing the wrong thing when in fact they had asked you for a poster....but the source of this is that they want you to succeed.

Ask them to work with you now on a roadmap for your graduation and what milestones/objectives they feel like you should aim for or accomplish to further your career and ask them how they can help you get there (ie with applications for conferences, joint authorship on review papers, running an experiment for a collaborator that will get you joint authorship on a paper in a related field etc).  Sounds like your advisor is annoyed that you weren't proactive about grabbing what they perceived to be an opportunity.

So at least you should know that you're not alone under these experience and pressure. \n\nActually, there's one point that I disagree with: **\"Everyone else is able to do it. What's wrong with me?\"** This is totally not the case. Almost everyone I know who is invested enough in the idea of getting a PhD is struggling, like *a lot*. For example, a postdoc I know who recently became a professor in a top university admitted that they were completely depressed while doing a PhD. Maybe that's just one reference point, but from all my experience I can tell you that the PhD is easy for no one, although the reasons for that are always unique. \n\nWhat's very good in your case is that you seem to be well aware of your situation on a rational level. Of course there is the stress and the anxiety that one cannot fully control at will, but one can try. \n\nWriting things down helps. Paradoxically, one can convince oneself that a complicated situation is under control by writing down an exhaustive list of bite-size sub-problems. \n\nLet's go through the list you put together: \n\n* **Extremely low probability of getting a visa sponsored job in the UK market**\n* **... and me needing to find a job to stay  in this country, because I don't want to go back to my home country**\n\nIs the UK your dream destination? You've mentioned that you don't want to go back to your home country, but there are many ways to work around that. If you end up getting your next job outside of the UK, you can then make a better decision as to where to settle down permanently (or not to settle down at all). Of course, this might be a bit of a hustle to arrange, especially if your girlfriend isn't as mobile as you. But I still recommend being open minded about where you go right after the PhD. After all, getting this type of degree makes you a world-class expert but in a narrow niche, and you already decided to relocate at least once for your studies, so why not be dynamic while you're young? Besides, there's still *some* probability that you'll find a nice job nearby. \n\nMost importantly: unless you have sufficient funds to do fun things after your PhD, try to start job hunting at least several months in advance. Having an offer for your next job may increase your confidence in your current one. \n\n* **Supervisor  pushing me to do software development for his spin-out company's  product, taking time away from my actual PhD thesis writing**\n\nThis sounds a weird, how are they pushing you to do anything that's not in scope of your thesis? Do you have a co-supervisor or the director of studies or someone else you could consult with? Or is it a question of earning extra money by working on the side? In any case, do not go along this dangerous path: unless you 100% know what you're doing, your supervisor might be taking advantage of you. \n\n* **I used to share my stresses with my gf, but she's been bogged with stresses and work of her own**\n\nIt's actually good that you are able to isolate your girlfriend from your PhD issues to some extent. It's nice when someone is \"there for you\" when you feel down, but forcing another person to live through all your PhD-related day-to-day problems wouldn't be fair and could negatively impact the relationship in the long run. \n\nIf you feel that you have no one to talk to about your problems, try to find support in a friend. Maybe someone you normally don't have enough time to hang out with? Go out with them, complain about life to each-other, talk it through. You might actually end up contributing to your friendship *and* getting the personal support that you need at the same time. \n\n* **Tried  talking to family back home. Mum is extremely passive and keeps telling  me to just get on with it and do as much as I can. Dad gets anxious  hearing about my anxiety and asks me to drop everything and come home.  None of which helps.**\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot tell you anything smart about how to deal with your family. One thing that helped me is to create the image of a person who's all under control, and maintain that image. This strategy works well for me because the knowledge about my problems would make my family members anxious without them being able to help, and this is what I want to avoid. If I needed any concrete help from them, hopefully I would be able to ask for it, but I try not to use this card too often. \n\n* **Basically have no one to talk to about my anxiety**\n\nYou have your GF, your family, your friends, and you have Reddit. But most importantly, you have *yourself*. I was surprised to discover that one can effectively discuss things with oneself. Writing is an example when this happens, but also actually talking out loud with yourself can be very helpful. I imagine a situation in which I'm overwhelmed with energy and don't know what to do with it. Then, I start a conversation. I ask myself basic questions and respond to them until I figure out what to do. \n\nThe reason this works, I think, is because I'm better at evaluation other people than myself. I could probably be a better supervisor for myself than a PhD student I am. Therefore, I just need to trick my mind to think about my own situation the way I would naturally process other people's cases if I were to guide them. Sounds trivial, but it worked for me; maybe it can work for you, too. \n\n* **University counselor is booked for weeks and I can't get an appointment**\n\nThis is unfortunately very typical for universities. I recommend booking these in advance. Even in some weeks time, you could probably still benefit from a consultation, so why not take this opportunity?

I've been stuck in this lab for years  while the world has moved on.**\n\nIndeed, this is the kind of experience that many people have toward the end of their PhD. To some extent it's really the case that a lot of time passed by. The PhD is designed to have strong impact on your life and career but *in the long run*. Most definitely, you have learned many things and gathered numerous experiences and skills that one would never get without going through your exact path. Let these things help forming your life after you graduate. You will be one in a million!\n\nRemember that the success of your peers does not lower the chance of your own success. \n\n* **Feel  extremely alone and worthless for not being able to handle my life. I  took the decision to do a PhD, I should be able to handle it. Everyone  else is able to do it. What's wrong with me?**\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you. You are handling your life quite well as far as I can judge. You are approaching the last mile of your PhD and it's expected to be hard. You are reflecting on your path so far, as you should. You managed to maintain healthy relationships with other people, so there will be those with whom you will celebrate when the journey is over.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f5tvof/anxiety_like_ive_never_felt_before_reaching_the/fi1c4s5/"}, "1265": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "wizus", "Date": 1582054817, "Score": 10, "Body": "* **I  was the kid who had potential in school.

If you complete your PhD (and it seems that you have excellent chances of getting there, given that none of your bullets are about doubt that you *can* graduate), it means you expanded the Boundary of Human Knowledge, at least a bit (I'm referring to [http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)). \n\nMore pragmatically: you probably have the money situation kinda figured out for now.

Although I am no longer in academia (I'm in industry) I still work in laboratory science and although my title isn't principle investigator I am the scientific lead on several projects managing both people and resources which is basically the industry equivalent...so I have gone from a graduate student perspective to a PI perspective.\n\nI give that as an intro to explain why I feel like I have an idea of what is going through a PI's head in these situations...and it isn't gaslighting.\n\nAs a PI you feel the burden of employing probably 10 or more people on the basis of the funding you manage to get.  That funding is, of course, dependant on the quality of your research but it is also dependant on your presence in the community.  That presence is built for sure on the basis of your publications but when people think about your lab (including funders) they typically think about interactions they have had with you at conferences or with employees of yours at conferences.  Conferences are a way of getting your reputation and name out there in a way that can really bolster your ability to get funding and maintain a lab or group.  You likely have 10+ people reporting to you and you spend 80% of your time grant writing or attending conferences/presentations/pressing-flesh and so you have very limited bandwidth for individual employees and generally think of them in terms of groups (the graduate students, the post docs, the staff scientists etc) and in terms of projects.\n\nChecking your calendar you might see a conference is coming up and quickly fire off some emails to staff about preparing an abstract for poster session before going back to what you were doing.  Three months later when the conference hits you might realize that no one is giving an oral presentation and that therefore your lab isn't going to get needed exposure to the community and it is too late to do anything about it.  Kicking yourself for not being more on top of it you think about who should have been the one to give the oral presentation and you think of your most experienced and successful graduate student.  Frustrated with yourself you then also get frustrated with them for not being proactive and supporting the lab by going for an oral presentation independently.  Its a visceral thing and when you see the grad student next you mouth off at them for not having applied for the oral presentation because you are frustrated.\n\nIf this grad students response is to then go through their emails, find an email you sent X months ago and since forgot about showing that you actually requested poster abstracts you very well might feel like they are blaming you and missing the point that it was important that the lab have a presence in the oral portion of the conference for the sake of future funding and the lab reputation.  You actually blame yourself as well but having that pointed out feels like an attack and the student saying it is up to you to tell them what to do makes you feel like they aren't being proactive or taking responsibility.  So in the moment you might respond with annoyance that their focus seems to be on blaming you rather than concern over the lab not having oral presentations during the conference.  But shortly after that event you have other things to do and 10+ employees who you also need to manage so you move on.\n\nNow.  If this student then, later, comes back to you and asks about future conferences, review submissions, book chapter submissions, and other things that get the labs name out there and helps to support and maintain lab funding and what they can do to be involved and help that would be a breath of fresh air.  Would totally change the recent dynamic, someone coming to you to actively offer to take something off your massive to-do list in a way that supports the lab.  You actually already had a list of upcoming events and were recently asked to submit a book chapter but didn't have time to start working on it.  You think immediately of a couple things that the student might be able to contribute in that would potentially end in more exposure for the lab and suggest that they look into them.  Student gets the potential of authorship on a review or book chapter or gets to go to the next conference (win) and you have a plan in place for something that was on your to-do list (win).  Student rises up in your estimation and you are more likely to speak of them positively in future.\n\nInstead, if a month later you get a call to come to talk with the graduate program director so they can talk to you about appropriate interaction with students you probably aren't going to know what triggered it, you may very well be annoyed you are being pulled away from the grant you are working on and there is going to be no association with that student because chances are you have long forgotten about that interaction.  If the graduate program director actually brings up the specific complaint with the specific student name you are probably going to be surprised and are going to feel like it is a very difficult awkward situation as you recognize any criticism you might give in future could be viewed as retaliation.... maybe just best to avoid communication with that student entirely as you do have other things you need to be doing and other employees that could use guidance.  That is if anything happens at all.\n\nWhew okay that was a lot longer than I meant it to be sorry.  I guess my point is I have actually been on both sides of this dynamic and I don't think it is advisable or advantageous to set up a potentially rather adversarial relationship with your PI.  Instead you can use their clear interest in getting lab recognition (wanting an oral presentation) and their clear thinking of you as the person to do that (clearly high opinion of you) as a way in to getting authorship or career advancement from upcoming events or opportunities.  PI's don't ask people  to represent their lab in an oral presentation at a conference lightly, that actually suggests they have a pretty high opinion of you professionally.  Up to you if you want to take advantage of that for the next round of opportunities.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f5qoac/my_boss_recently_attacked_me_about_why_didnt_i/fi1gi44/"}, "1276": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Biscuits_for_Dragons", "Date": 1582057299, "Score": 6, "Body": "As an international student in the UK, I really really feel this.

I have achieved what's expected of me in the PhD, nothing to the level that I was expecting of myself however. I do have a couple of conference publications, a journal publication etc. But the hope of doing world changing research is thwarted. It's like a sick joke that I ever thought I could now.

This is not something I had imagined would happen. \n\nIt's just draining that's all. Knowing that this fight for survival is quite real, and contrasting it to the hopes and dreams I had when I left my home country.

I was with him through grad school as well. Without knowing what field your husband wants to do his PhD in, here is my advice:\n\nFirst and foremost, take care of yourself. The stressful and post-PhD process will not only take it's toll on your husband (and friend and sibling), but by extension you as well.\n\nEncourage the PhD students in your life to take care of themselves. PhD programs tend to have insane workloads and encourage self-sacrifice. Even in the face of seemingly insurmountable piles of work and ever-looming deadlines, it's important (and helps with productivity) to take breaks to eat, sleep, shower, and deal with other basic needs, as well as make time for family and friends.\n\nThat being said, your husband, friend, and sibling are going to be insanely busy at times and won't be as available to spend time you. Use this time to pursue hobbies and spend time with other friends and family.\n\nDo whatever you can to obtain employable skills and establish yourself in a career that pays enough for you to become the sole breadwinner for your family. PhD stipends/grants tend to be low, if your husband gets funding at all (I *really* don't recommend doing a PhD program without funding, btw). Plus, job prospects are terrible for PhDs in many fields, so your husband could end up unemployed after he gets his PhD. Save as much money as you can to prepare for this possibility.\n\nAlso, unless you want a long-distance marriage, try to get into a career where remote work is prevalent, or a career that's available in many different locations. I don't know what your husband's career goals or post-PhD plans are, but if they involve academia, you need to be ready to move anywhere in the country, possibly multiple times, after he's done with his PhD.\n\nFinally, as others have stated, when your husband, friend, and sibling each face rejection (which is inevitable in academia), remind them not to take it too personally, and that they're still good people. \n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f6dujr/support_for_phd_candidates/fi4dt8x/"}, "1361": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "magentalovely_", "Date": 1582141803, "Score": 9, "Body": "You are definitely not alone on this journey.

It can be something like the school understanding that they can not provide what the applicant is looking for in a PhD. For example, I want to study type 1 diabetes at a weird cross-section where immunology and developmental biology intersect. As such, when I was applying to programs, I got denied to schools that had diabetes programs simply because they weren't a good fit for the specific goal that I was aiming for. \n\nGrad school applications aren't really like all the job application processes you've been through before. In job applications, you need to answer the question in a specific way that the job is looking for, even though it doesn't actually matter for the job. We get jobs to put food on the table, but have to explain why we are passionate about working at McDonald's or JiffyLube. For grad school applications, that isn't how it works anymore. How you write the essays and speak with the interviewers needs to be much more honest (trust me, they know when it isn't). You'll spend the next 4-6 years working with these people, and they actually do care that you're doing it for the right reasons, are the type of person who can handle it, and that you are wanting to get the PhD for the right reasons. By dropping the charade of a \"job interview\" song and dance, they can accurately evaluate if this is really the right thing for the applicant. Just because they say no doesn't mean that the applicant isn't good enough, it just means that that particular opportunity isn't the right one.\n\nSorry if I wrote this more as if you were the applicant, but hopefully it will help give you some things to consider when trying to be supportive towards your loved ones!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f6dujr/support_for_phd_candidates/fi6039v/"}, "1387": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "psychominnie624", "Date": 1582175569, "Score": 23, "Body": "This is an incredibly common feeling that actually has a name, imposter syndrome.

It always you to tag and colour code papers with different themes, add notes and documents to each paper as well as create a bibliography. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I start on it, get stressed out, and run away to some different piece of work to distract me. \n\nThis is classic avoidance - working on the draft makes you feel worried that it's not good enough, so you avoid it. But that makes it more stressful and the cycle continues. You also start to believe that you can't deal with those emotions because you've been avoiding them for so long. You need to change your mindset about this piece of work - it doesn't need to be perfect (look up \"all or nothing thinking\"). It's going to be the worse piece of work you do in your PhD but that's okay because it's your first piece of work and you're learning. Google \"avoidance coping\" and you'll see it's a common problem for many people, especially those with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Everyone seemed so into their research, really motivated and I just felt like I wasn\u2019t like them \n\nI can assure you not everyone was as massively passionate about their research as you think. Having a good work-life balance and other interests outside your research is a very good thing. The reason many people at the event seemed like this is because that's the impression they were trying to give, not because they are like this 24/7. They were at a research event, trying to network, thinking about research and getting excited about it. They are not like this all the time. As you work on your niche area more you will find you have more to say and contribute at these sorts of events. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I sit in reading groups for the PhD cohort and I don\u2019t contribute anything, I\u2019m unable to formulate ideas and speak them coherently when in a settling like that.  \n\nI honestly didn't speak in any meetings until about a year in (partly because I'm super shy but partly because I felt I didn't have any good ideas). I felt like I didn't have enough understanding or knowledge to comment. But then I gradually learnt more, started forming my own opinions and was confident enough to contribute. You will get there eventually - maybe try and set yourself a target of asking at least 1 question at every meeting/talk you attend. Also at some point you'll probably feel strongly about a topic and you're feel compelled to speak about it, like you couldn't stop yourself if you tried. Until then try not to beat yourself up. Look up \"negative filtering\" - it could be that actually you do have good ideas or good meetings, you're just not giving them the same weight as the times when you don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I know this is a bit of imposter syndrome kicking in, but I don\u2019t know how to deal with it because I am actually, seriously, an imposter. \n\nThis is **exactly** what imposter syndrome is. Yes you understand it's a thing, but you're actually REAL imposter and soon someone will recognise that and out you... that's still imposter syndrome. Honestly it's a lot easier emotionally to think of yourself as an imposter than to entertain the fact that you do deserve to be here and you might be capable of all this and more. And it's to be expected that you feel like an imposter because you are only 5 months in! You're surrounded with people who have more experience than you and who are trying hard to show themselves in the best light possible (like the people at the library event). Try not to not get hung up on it - it's potentially a good thing because it means you're surrounded by people who are experienced and intelligent and who are going to help you grow. It's one of the privileges of working in academia. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps. I had (and still have) very similar problems as you're dealing with.

The lack of structure and differentiation between work, life, and necessity causes all sorts of problems including burnout and depression.  I try to limit myself to a normal workweek and distance myself from my cohort because they can be awfully toxic when it comes to work ethic.  In my last masters I also stopped and looked at the people in my year and asked myself \"Would I be friends with any of these people if I didn't have to be\", the answer was a resounding \"No\".  So I don't force myself to hang out or spend time with people who have made their entire lives, 24/7 about their work.  I don't want to go to the pub and have to talk about what I've just been talking about for the last 8 hours.  I also don't want to be pressured by them because of their management skills or obsession over work.  If they want to go back to work after a pint, fine, but I'm going home to play video games, watch TV, have dinner with my gf, etc.  Try joining a sports team, club, or society that has nothing to do with your degree and just ignore people in your cohort that try to pressure you into stuff. \n\nAlso, I've found that SMART are really important as well as the Three Legged Stool.  Essentially giving yourself goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.  There are tons of variations on it and obviously A and R are a bit redundant.  Anyway, the point is to just break your work up into something you know you can complete within the time that you want to complete it.  For example, if you're not getting any work done you can start small and specific, say read a single article from 8am-10am and write 250 words by noon.  A very small and achievable goal to do work when you weren't doing anything before.   \n\n\nThe other important thing which kinda goes with the first part I mentioned is the Three Legged Stool.  You can't have a three legged stool where one of the legs is out of balance, in this case the legs are Work, Play, and Necessity.  Work is work obviously, play is anything you do for fun or enjoy doing, and necessity is the stuff you have to do regularly, chores, pay bills, etc.  If you do too much of one you become unbalanced and miserable.  I noticed in my MA I spent way too much time on work and would often procrastinate doing it and when I'd procrastinate I'd unconsciously punish myself and lose motivation to do other things in life, primarily video games which I love to play.  When I started setting smaller more manageable goals I didn't feel so bad at the end of the day and refound my motivation to do things I enjoyed and even do my work.    \n\n\nAnyway, that was a long ramble, I hope it's helpful in some way.

Also supervisors on occasion can forget about things not directly in front of them so can neglect part timers or get annoyed that they are ready to work on something but a part timers working schedule doesn't coincide with that in the same way a full time can be made to do set work at set times. She has being doing hers for three years and her supervisors won't even let her create any kind of experiment or data collection instrument, just read and rewrite your proposal over and over for the last three years.\n\nI'd say you can do it but it will take 6+ years at the fastest, in American it could be over a decade, and you will have a lot more struggles because part timers are almost second class researchers in lots of places' eyes. \n\nI say all of this as fair warning and not to discourage you but for you to be informed and be able to plan accordingly.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f7deq4/advice_for_phdproposallost/fidtcj2/"}, "1549": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "arbab002", "Date": 1582375810, "Score": 2, "Body": "Wow.

Even your reply has helped a ton.\n\nI think you're partially right, there have certainly been instances where I have used what was happening around me to avoid working on the PhD. And even if I just took a month here or there to avoid it, they all stack up. I can't deny there's definitely been resistance on my part on occasion to this work, but a lot of that came from a complete lack of support and structure from my department. I was floundering and had no idea what to do and couldn't get a foothold. It wasn't until 2018 when I attended a postgrad research and writing workshop that I finally managed to get a handle on things and began my PhD in earnest. (I think my supervisor sensed I was struggling as he was the one who suggested it.) So it could even be a matter of me having started my PhD too early in life before I had matured enough to work on it myself, combined with the other factors in my life, that caused issues. Hard to say but I could self-reflect and self-analyse forever and never truly know what caused any of this.\n\nHowever, I will say that, at least for myself, I have never given up on a project and never failed to deliver an essay or pass my courses without an upper-level grade, so failing this PhD (though it may be a different beast) was not an option which caused me to continue the fight no matter what.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; If you couldn't finish it in 7 years what makes you think you can do it any another university? \n\nMy hope is that being in a new environment in another country away from easy reach of my family might help me focus better and allow me to get through my work uninterrupted (within reason).

You could have supported her through Skype, email, etc. Why are you everyone's caretaker? \n\nNo, they won't all disappear, but being in another country completely will set up a barrier of a kind which should encourage them to solve their own problems (to a degree), but recently I have made it very clear to them that I can't be their problem solver anymore and they've understood my point of view. And yes, I am now making my PhD a priority - it's been a long road and I've had to change a lot but here we are.\n\nAlso, you misread regarding my sister's wedding, it didn't fail after four months, it failed after 4 HOURS. I was there when it happened and I felt I had to help. It's easy to suggest I should have just left her and my parents to their own devices but this was before my family began using my as the *de facto* problem solver and my sister and parents were in trouble and I felt I needed to help them. Skype wouldn't have cut it, I needed to be there to help out.\n\nBut, things have changed since then. I've done my best to make it clear to them they need to solve their own problems now and I think I've gotten through to them. But look, it's not easy to walk away from your family when they're in trouble, so of course I will help when I can.

Some fields are harder than others (Finance, for example, is often considered one of the hardest), but none of them can be considered easy. \n\nJob opportunities for business PhDs are better than most other PhDs, stipends are also typically better, we usually don't need a post-doc. So, business PhD programs attract a lot of people around the world, with a lot of different backgrounds. \n\nMost of us are international students, so that's not a problem. \n\nGPA is not very relevant for PhD applications, with 3.6 you would be ok. \n\nI also don't expect an MBA to make much of a difference. If it's from a top university, or something like that, maybe a little more. But the main issue is that MBAs usually don't provide much opportunity for academic research experience. So, having an MBA won't hurt, but also won't help very much. \n\nI'm not sure what you would consider as mid-tier. But top 20 schools are considered very, very hard, being a crapshoot even for applicants with a perfect profile. Top 50 are still very hard, you should have something really good to show to expect an offer from them. It's rare to see applicants targeting below top 100. \n\nIt's also important to remember that rankings can be very misleading and hard to use as a guideline. Tiers can matter more, if you are talking about R1 and R2 universities. But usually business PhD applicants focus on R1, which has more than 100 universities already. \n\nThings that are more important than GPA and MBA, and would help to answer whether you seem to have a good chance of getting admitted or not:\n\n\\- A great GMAT score. 650 is considered the bare minimum. 700 is considered the minimum recommended. You need more than that to have a score that is considered strong. Most schools also accept the GRE.\n\n\\- Research experience. If you have papers, conference presentations, things like that. This can really help a lot.\n\n\\- Great letters of recommendation. Another thing that can be very helpful, if you can get 3 letters of recommendations from academic researchers with a good reputation, for example. \n\nDepending on the field or concentration, there are other things that could be relevant.

This matters because a PhD means more from good schools because you can sell yourself with more of a brand impact. That means something, for better or for worse, when you look for jobs. So, to set yourself up, you need to do good work. You need to spend a fair amount of time sorting schools by faculty interests and weed down to a list of 20 schools or so which will be good fits. You need to write to about 2--3 of these schools (the more unique the SOP the better), but at least aim to vary 1--2.5 paragraphs (intro and conclusion minimum for every school, but you obviously might want to narrow down school/faculty-specific interests and 'connect' how your past prepared you to work in this area/with this school-specific faculty member) tailored to each school. Keep an excel sheet of faculty btw. Reach out to these people early, too, to see if you can gauge their interest in continuing in some area with you, or if they'd be willing to work in that area if you got in. Protip: don't apply to schools with one faculty in the area you are interested in; don't apply to schools where the faculty hasn't researched in the area of interest (AOI) in the past 15 years; don't apply to schools where the full professor faculty member(s) in your AOI are likely to retire in the next 1--3 years; don't apply to schools where the faculty in your AOI haven't published at all in the last 5 years. Keep an eye out for schools with no full professors in your AOI, with mostly junior faculty in your AOI, etc. Also, try to apply to more schools with faculty members from your home country. A lot of programs sort PhD applicants by passport, so, you have a much better chance of getting in if a faculty member is from where you are and in your AOI since they're more knowledgeable about how good of an applicant you are.

You will be required to learn as much as possible about your chosen research area (or more if you do rotations in other areas 1st), how academia works, how different techniques and instruments work, how to gather, interpret and present data so that it can be understood by different audiences, and, equally importantly, how to deal with your PI (Professor our supervisor), colleagues and post-docs. Doing a PhD is equally about the soft skills that you learn as the technical ones. Learning to manage your own time, keep yourself motivated (this is a big one), public speaking, presentations, people management, expectations management, and dealing with perhaps the most bizarre hierarchical system you will ever encounter. \n\nAll of the above are important skills that will be related to work after.

In fact, become more than ok with it and embrace because it will be your best bet at building a support network of those that understand you. Friendships with locals will build very slowly \u2014 you have less in common with them and, if you\u2019re American, you most likely are used to building friendships faster. Plus you\u2019re struggling with the language barrier. Expats tend to share English as a common language, so you\u2019re all on similar ground with that. \n\nThere are a few ways you can meet other foreigners, but you can try and see if there are any meet-up groups for expats, if there is a local expat community somewhere, if the local embassy has events, or if your university has an international student office/database. I would also recommend the couchsurfing platform as there are sometimes some good events that they put together. \n\nIf you want to build friendships with locals, you\u2019re likely going to have to do so by starting an activity or a sport. That puts you in constant contact and gives you a goal to work toward which is more likely to foster relationships than a work situation. I mentioned above that Americans tend to build their friendships quicker than those of other nationalities, but we also tend to expect that work relationships and friendships are likely to be the same thing. In many/most places, that\u2019s not the expectation. Again, not sure if you\u2019re American, but it may not be the most productive idea to focus on building your friendships where you work. \nIn any case, good luck, and remember that you are an awesome and intelligent human being whose worth and awesomeness are not diminished by being in a difficult social situation at the moment!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/fa8vxk/feeling_isolated_and_out_of_place_in_phd_abroad/fiye914/"}, "2056": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Grevious47", "Date": 1582839410, "Score": 12, "Body": "Academic life kills your motivation/enthusiasm\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEI0DxfVoAA1uDW.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEI0DxfVoAA1uDW.jpg)  \n\n\nThe professor scam  \n[https://external-preview.redd.it/RbxArDeaf5VBk5fiKLoRGgnJ3lTqnGbvN0siE4hG1wI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5373e122dfdd97097efd94e2d46a303ac05fc06f](https://external-preview.redd.it/RbxArDeaf5VBk5fiKLoRGgnJ3lTqnGbvN0siE4hG1wI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5373e122dfdd97097efd94e2d46a303ac05fc06f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn general Piled Higher and Deeper comics is a good source", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/faegc1/anti_phd_and_postdoc_memes_needed_asap/fiyhbad/"}, "2057": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Grevious47", "Date": 1582839930, "Score": 5, "Body": "Most people I think when they first start grad school scramble to try to read about everything in the field and get textbooks and read those or take classes on the topics they are going to be working in.

You wait until you are told what you need to do next, you listen closely and if you have good understanding and interpretation skills you follow the instruction-set faithfully, absorb the information provided to you, and accomplish the work.  If you are in grad school now you did well in college so you already know how to do that....so don't focus on doing more of that.\n\nGrad school turns that on its head.  Grad school isn't about following instructions, its about looking around you to see what resources you have available, deciding what your goal should be and then formulating a plan to accomplish that goal with the resources you have available.  In otherwords you write yourself a set of instructions to follow.  The people who really struggle with Grad school are those who sit around waiting for someone to come tell them what they should be doing and it takes them several years to figure out no one is coming to do that.\n\nAs for reading textbooks on your topic honestly that is what college was for.  You read up on the basic history and background of the field you are interested in and came to understand it well enough that if you read something new about it you could understand that based on your knowledge base.  Reading more textbooks on the topic is unlikely to change that and what you end up actually doing in grad school isn't going to be in a textbook.\n\nI'd look into \"project management\" and \"time management\" in terms of self-help or guidebooks, just select some of the more popular ones.

I would appreciate an extension on the deadline you have provided so that I can consider all factors.\"\n\nI did this and they were totally down with it. For what it's worth the situation was a bit different -- waitlisted at two much better schools than the one I was considering, just a hair lower in its reputation, and knew I'd strongly consider one of the others if I got off the waitlist. Told the other school the whole picture and they were all the more excited to know they had made a good call accepting me (if other schools are interested, we saw the right things, etc etc).\n\nThen when I didn't get off the waitlists, the original school wasn't cold about my acceptance or anything. They knew they weren't as competitive as the other schools.

For most other jobs, this amount of failures would be totally unacceptable. But, for a researcher, this is expected. Thus, this is not a job where the perfectionist mentality really works. Of course, I gotta try my best. But trying to be perfect in a career full of failures doesn't seem the right.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/fbhlen/papers_vs_grades_finding_that_perfect_balance/fj4do6m/"}, "2157": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "wanderbooks", "Date": 1583005878, "Score": 1, "Body": "I see.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/f3ijqt/understanding_phd_stipends_in_the_us/fj4dp4x/"}, "2158": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bdinho10", "Date": 1583006320, "Score": 1, "Body": "Getting married to my high school sweetheart next year (currently in first year PhD).

For us, the major strain on pur relationship has always been the brutal academic job market, the constant threat of having to move across the country again for his next academic gig, and the resulting financial instability.\n\nAs the spouse of an academic, my advice for academics in long term relationships is to constantly communicate and make sure that your priorities, values, and goals stay compatible with your partner's. Healthy relationships involve give and take from both partners, not one partner doing all the giving and the other partner doing all the taking. If you expect your partner to always be the one dropping everything and uprooting their life for your academic career, your partner will eventually become resentful about their goals and needs always playing second fiddle to your career. Conversely, if you feel like you're giving up on your career goals too soon solely for your partner's benefit, you will likely resent your partner for that.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/fbeq87/breakups/fj4qlau/"}, "2165": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Zifnab_palmesano", "Date": 1583017427, "Score": 4, "Body": "I think you should tell him about your feelings, so he can be more understanding of your stress and duality.
