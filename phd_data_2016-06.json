Don't attribute it to your kids, or your husband: most of the other miserable posters don't have these, and they are still depressed/anxious/suicidal.  It's the system: almost all PhD students spend their days having their \"inferiority\" rubbed in their noses.\n\nThe first time I tried a PhD, I had custom-built my life to perfectly support my studies.  I had a calm stable supportive partner, home, finances, stress-relieving hobbies, no kids or pets or anything distracting; I was smart, focused, motivated, and had a good background in the subject.  In short, I had my life more together than pretty much all my professors.  And they were so bitter over it, they wouldn't work with me.  But the miserable students whose lives were in shambles, they were happy to help and graduate.  So it's not about homelife.\n\nYou absolutely can do a PhD.  RP, paper-writing, and literature familiarity are masterable.\n\nBut here's what you need to do.  You need to make up your mind what path you are going to pursue with your life, and then go do that.  **There is no path in life that is easy.**  If you don't decide on the goal, you'll never get there.  Whatever you want to do, you can do it, or at least make great progress toward that goal.  But there's not time to do everything that crosses your mind, so you have to choose the most important, commit to it, and pursue it.  For me, personally, this was getting a PhD: I nuked pretty much everything else in my life to make that happen.  But of course, the answer will be different for everybody.  Everyone's goal is unique.\n\n&gt; At my graduation ceremony one of my lecturers [...] doing a PhD [...] So I applied\n&gt;\n&gt; I fell pregnant again\n&gt; \n&gt; I was just told to write them for experience\n&gt; \n&gt; If it leads places then great\n\nThese are not the words of someone who has made up their mind what the goal is.

Reasons involving the background of someone who becomes a professor and why they become a professor, and reasons involving the pressures of the academic system in shaping how professors spend their time.  But none of this matters.  What matters is: What exactly is your goal, and, given that you now have more insight on the system, does a PhD help you reach that goal?  For some people the answer is yes: they want to use the PhD as a credential to gain respectability for their research; or their parents never went to college and they want to prove PhD's are doable; or they are good at negotiating collaborations in bureaucracy and want to work behind the scenes wrestling over funding.  For other people the answer is no: they wanted to prove they were smart, and realized that banging their head against a keyboard for 5 years was not the way to do it; or they wanted a stable job and realized that the academic pipeline was not a good path; or they loved a particular subject but realized that academia ruined it for them.\n\n&gt; pretend to care about writing papers (my adviser hasn't published a journal paper in...ten years?)\n\nI am sure you realize this, but this is not the track record of a reputable professor.

There's many different kinds of professors out there; if you still want to be a professor, you don't have to be at all like your advisor.  Remember back to when you first wanted to be a professor: what qualities did your professor role models have, that you wanted to be like?  Or, you don't have to be a professor at all, if that's not your goal.\n\nAlso, are you being careful to attend conferences and symposiums and stay in contact with lots of researchers outside your immediate group?

Most PhD's are taking someone else's work and going far enough to earn your PhD.  It isn't about doing your own thing, you have to put in the research and publish time as well.  Most professors want to see that you can indeed conduct research, present your findings, and continue forward with new research.  I'd say you'll probably start by spending 80%+ time on the group's research and 40% time on teaching/research on their stuff (if you are being paid by school) and then the rest of the time catching up on sleep.  \n\nHuge teams working in the area?  Then find them, talk with them, see if you can contribute to their research in any way.  But before you do that, find a good adviser.  They make all the difference in the world.\n\nGood luck to you my friend.

I can see that you don't like research at all. My suggestions are:\n \n1. How far do you think you're away from getting your PhD? If you can get your degree with the current project published. DO IT. PhD is still valuable than master degree and will give you a higher level position when you look for jobs.  Motivate yourself for a different reason - rather than solving complicated world's problems or deepening our knowledge or making our society a better place or whatever glorious reasons you used to have, change the reason to that you want to leave academia and be happy again, so getting your paper out is the only key to that.  Don't worry about the value or significance of your study - it does not matter to you if you are leaving academia. Most of the studies in science are crap anyway.  So work every possible way (except unethical conducts) to get it out as fast as you can.  \n\n2. If you think you will not have any publication in the next 1 or 2 years simply because the project is a dead end and you can't stand doing current research for even one more day, man up and tell your advisor your thought. Get a master degree immediately and look for other jobs.  If you decide to go this route, make it happen as soon as possible and move on. It's called cut loss. You might have a less valuable degree status than PhD but you cut your opportunity cost - it might not be a bad thing and you might come ahead in a few years both professionally and financially compared to getting a PhD. I have several friends who chose this route and they never regretted doing so. They were very happy with their choice. \n\n3. No matter what your final choice is, start thinking about your future career direction and preparing for it NOW! This is the most important thing.  There are several options to go:\na) getting additional training (apply for a different program) for certain jobs - medical school, law school, business school or a master program that has a very good job prospect such as accounting, computer science, statistics, finance etc. However, this option requires you to stay in school for another few years and may incur debt.\nb) Consider jobs that do not require additional formal training such as consulting, scientific writing, sales, etc. Although these jobs usually only need a bachelor degree, a PhD will probably put you at a higher starting position, especially in certain specialized industries. \n\n4.

I got 18 credits from my masters, leaving me only 54 credits to complete.\r5. Find a professor/advisor who work on health care systems management. You will have an advantage here. I worked on renewable energy evaluations, similar to what I was doing when working.\r6. Let your department head and advisor that you are interested to go to a teaching institution, and you want to have the opportunity to be a grad teaching assistant or an instructor of any course.

Whether it be building up a conference paper with supporting details or attempting to find a dissertation topic.  There are instances where a PhD student will be months into their dissertation only to have to pivot because someone produces something close to or even the same as their dissertation.  If you are committed for the paper and not the journey, you will likely fail to complete it.  PhD work is far different than the undergrad and most master's programs.  \n\nAs far as industry, if you have a PhD and no work experience or even some work experience, most places will see your PhD as 'too expensive' for the same reason that you articulated in your reply \"I'm worth more!!!\".  Just research \"Does a PhD enhance or hurt job prospects\" and read about how to continue outside of academic environment.  Most industries would rather have a Master's than a PhD for actual work.  The mindset that you have a PhD sometimes convinces the people you are trying to work for that you are a thinker and not a do'er.  \n\nThat being said, PhD work is hard.  I haven't completed mine yet and it is by far the hardest thing I've done.  I have a Master's and undergrad in computer science with a minor in math.  I have built safety critical real-time software, healthcare software, legal software, and helped start a company.  I have a kid and I've done some pretty difficult transitions in life.
