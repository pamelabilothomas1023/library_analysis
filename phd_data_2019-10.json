I have a lot of ideas, for a lot of things (e.g., projects, methods), but I still don't have the knowledge and experience to evaluate them. So, it's helpful to get the perspective of someone else who is more experienced.

I know this is where I struggle the most, and something he is great with. Other parts, like literature review, writing, time-management, I can handle them better. But there is a lot to learn in math/statistics/econometrics/machine learning, etc. Many of them are not easy (at least not for me), and it's hard to know what could be helpful for me. Without some guidance, I can waste a lot of time, struggling with things that are not useful. So, when he tells me that something like state-space models or hidden Markov models can be helpful, at least I can focus on that, even if I have no idea what that is yet.\n\nFor other PhD students, it can be very different. Some of them may have a hard time coming up with research ideas. Some of them may have a hard time with the writing process.

Most companies are interested with me but I often lose against candidates with 'real experience' (that's the next thing I'm going to tackle in my interviews). But that's something to worry about later on. Does your university have facilities that offer career training and advice? If so, contact them asap, even when you're still in doubt.

Secretly, I didn't believe I could ever finish my own plan and my research method didn't fit me personally. Professors from other departments also looked at the project with a raised eyebrow, which fed my insecurity. I just could not see how I would ever come to a thesis with it and eventually I went into a sick burnout that took me almost a year to recover from. In the end, it took me 4 years to finally quit because I was scared too, and still loved the stuff that I was working on, and I loved teaching students. Still, academia was a nightmare for me.\n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is, do I know whether my thesis is managable in 2 years, and how can I be sure I can work on it with a healthy attitude and state of being. That thing will not write itself and you need to come healthy out of this, because a PhD is nothing but the first step into academia. So please, don't see the thesis as something that will bring salvation to all your doubts and struggles, it won't. I've seen several people like me that did finish the thesis or are still trying after 6 years, it didn't get better for them because those feelings of depression are often linked to something else and linger on afterwards, partly because you've been so long in it, it becomes a natural state of being for people.\n\nTo end my lengthy post, screw everyone else, you need to become healthy and happy!

When I applied, there were two things related to what you described. A Statement of Purpose, and a Personal Statement. Every school required a Statement of Purpose, some schools also allowed a Personal Statement.\n\nThe Statement of Purpose is more forwarding thinking, and more professional. About your plans for the future as you are applying to a job, not about your background. So, it tells why you want to do a PhD, what are the topics you want to research, why did you decide to apply to that school, what are the professors that would be a good match for you, etc. In short, what will you do (if accepted) and why.  \n\nIt's usually better to be focused. For example, you should explain why do you think that advisor is perfect for you, and that cannot be some general stuff that would apply to anyone. If you tell that someone is perfect just because of high productivity in research, for example, then a lot of professors would be perfect for you. And that doesn't make sense. \n\nBut be careful to not be too specific. If you are too specific in your interests, for example, it could look like almost no one in the department will be able to help you. I started writing my research interests in a more general way, but then I provided some specific examples of the kind of research I would like to do. \n\nNow, the Personal Statement is more personal (well, that's kinda obvious). It's about who you are, as a researcher, as a professional, as a person, etc. In this case, your background, your personality, your values may be important.

That's why I did this AMA. \n\n1. So most PhD programmes in the UK have the masters programme intergrated anyway. Basically what happens, after the end of your first year, you will have something called an upgrade. You'll write a report of what you've done in your first year and have an oral exam in front of your supervisor and another academic. This mimics the viva, the exam you need to pass at the end of the PhD programme. After the upgrade review, the supervisors will either say that you're making satisfactory progress and will be \"upgraded\" from a masters status to a PhD status, or they will advise you that you're not making satisfactory progress and will offer you an MPhil instead (this almost never happens). But the upgrade is a great way of documenting your progress so far and helps you develop critical skills you will need later in the PhD, such as your writing and presenting abilities. \n2. Absolutely, the nationality of the student is irrellevant, the factor that decides the funding is the advertisment for the PhD. It will either say fully funded (you'll get paid a stipend) or self-funded (meaning you will be required to fund yourself for everything (you can apply for external funding from organisations such as the medical research council). \n3. A lot of PhD programmes will involve teaching undergrads at some point (for example my contract states I am required to do 96 hours of teaching a year). If you can get any experience with this it would be good and make you stand out a bit, such as tutoring or peer mentoring. Otherwise, if there are any particular areas you will be applying for, do some research and find out what lab techniques are commonly used in these areas, like protein purification is a big thing in biochemistry for example. If you get the chance, like in your final year Bsc reasearch project try to get on a project that will incorporate these techniques. \n4. The things I love the most are being in control of my own project, the fact my project has the potential to make peoples' lives better, the lifestyle (can arrive and leave the lab when I want as long as I am getting work done) and when you are working on something for a while and it finally works, the feeling is pretty amazing. Also knowing you're going to be a world leading expert on your sebject is also great motivation. The things I dislike are a lot of science is repetitive. You have to get n=6 for PhD thesis standard, which can be 6 weeks for 1 experiment. If you do get a funded PhD, sometimes the money can be a bit tight, but can't really complain about that too much. You have to make sure you get the right supervisor as well, as I have heard some horror stories about nightmare supervisors. \n\nGood luck with applying!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dcp5ag/im_a_final_year_biological_sciences_phd_student/f2ae5ya/"}, "184": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Elesday", "Date": 1570112452, "Score": 3, "Body": "There are a lot of pros and cons.

And that is very collaborative, very related to problem-solving. I wouldn't be able to do anything I'm doing now without the collaboration of companies, for example. \n\nResearch in the field of Marketing Strategy, for example, is almost defined by that. It's usually not Marketing Strategy research is it's not about solving real-world problems for real-world people. Marketing Strategy research is often a researcher helping companies to solve the problems that they have. The company gets the help they need, and the researcher gets a research out of it.\n\nYou are usually specialized in one thing.

Sometimes the whole thing seems pretty insurmountable/just incredibly long? I've just started my research after spending the first year reading around my subject, and it just feels like I've started down a very very long road. I think it's very natural for PhDs to feel this way, as you say, and the way I get around it is by breaking things up into smaller, more manageable chunks. I tell my supervisor about the deadlines I've set myself and try to stick to those as much as possible, even though they are entirely self imposed. I think it's good to balance that with some flexibility. In other words, over summer I went through a real slump (I suffer from anxiety), so I just ditched my summer deadlines and took time off instead. \n\n&gt;I don't have ambition to go into academia, I don't have strong passion for the subject (though can find it interesting).\n\nAgain, this is very similar to me. I don't have any desire to go into academia either.

I've definitely had these worries and thoughts, but I tend to just tell myself that life isn't all about getting on a career path. I chose to do a PhD because I want to do one in my life.

I'm now a TT assistant professor.\n\nI've been doing ethnography for a decade or so (nearly a 1/3 of my life at this point. I'm in my early 30s). I started, like you, a project during my MA that would serve as the basis for my dissertation later on. In total, I did about 8 years of on and off again fieldwork thanks to a few small internal and external research grants (I should say I live/teach in the US and I also did my fieldwork in the states, so language acquisition was not an additional challenge that's so common to anthropological research).\n\nI landed a Wenner-Gren dissertation fieldwork grant in my last year of coursework. You'll want to look into those now, as well as NSF and other grant organizations. Fieldwork is expensive. I'd also start going (if you haven't already) to the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting (especially if you're based in the US) + other regional meetings like the American Ethnological Society whenever feasible. Be better than my socially-awkward ass and network A LOT.\n\nAnyway, the WG afforded me the opportunity to relocate and do a bit over 12 consecutive months of fieldwork full-time (I taught part-time on the side so I could actually afford to live). After that, transcriptions/organization, and then writing took about another year (I got a writing grant and that allowed me to do a bit more fieldwork while writing). I finished rather quickly. It was not graceful, unfortunately, more like a sprinter whose bloated corpse somehow plopped across the finish line...and then I landed a TT job (thanks to applying to A LOT of positions) immediately after graduating. \n\nNow, about jobs. I did a double PhD so that I would be more marketable. If you look at HigherEdJobs right now, you'll see a total of 195 advertised positions in anthropology. Of those, many are adjunct gigs and/or jobs that will be outside your subfield specialization(s). Of those full-time position solicitations that do exist that are in your subfield, many will be highly tailored around geographic area/culture and oftentimes a very, very targeted set of research foci.\n\nNow, compare that to Communication/Media Studies. On HigherEd, there are about 780 jobs listed right now. Many of those are adjunct/non-permanent, many exist outside of my specific specialization, but there are far more positions available than within anthropology. So, if you can double major, I would recommend it. I have several friends with a PhD in anthropology who, despite doing excellent work, were unable to find a good faculty job...a colleague who received a PhD in folklore, for instance, has been an adjunct and barely surviving for about 6 years...and its done a number of the individual's mental and physical health. So...if nothing else, don't get a PhD in folklore....solid advice, if I have any to give. And that's not to discredit folklore studies as a field of inquiry (I do this kind of work), but this is a practical/logistical kind of comment. Very few people get jobs with that degree that is worth it, at least in monetary/lifetime happiness terms. \n\nSo, overall, I'd pursue your master's project, get into the field and suss things out from there. Search for funding, publish something if you can, attend a conference, and then see how you feel. You may hate academia. Likewise, consider NGOs and other kinds of applied research.

I'm trying to finish up by May 2020, after a disappointingly long time with a mostly absentee advisor who never really spends any time reading/critiquing my work if he can help it. Finally got my butt in gear though and figured out how to motivate my advisor and myself so here I am. \n\n**What did you do last week? (Brainstorm everything, but especially congratulate yourself for things that went well, any struggles you overcome. Recognising when you achieve milestones is important.)**\n\nLast week I defended my dissertation proposal! I also taught a guest lecture on epidemiological and laboratory methods last week, helped out another student who is going to run some samples on my instrument in the lab, and did some actual honest-to-goodness gardening and housework around my home, so overall I'm feeling like it was a pretty productive week. Funny, because at the time I felt like everything was a failure.\n\n**What does this project need now?**\n\nMy thesis has three chapters, and each one needs a published (or at least submitted) journal article. So I'm writing my Chapter 1 methods into a paper.  We also have a paper submitted that is in revisions with the journal editor/reviewers and just sent my responses for that off to my advisor so if he kicks it back with more edits I'll need to work on that.  \n\n**Goals for the week:**\n\nMonday: Paper revisions. Got my data loaded into R in the structure I want.\n\nTuesday: Lab work. Getting reacquainted with R, working on data analysis.\n\nWednesday: Data analysis, working on intro/methods for Chapter 1 paper. Meeting with committee member.\n\nThursday: Lab. Plus more writing, data analysis.\n\nFriday: Writing in the morning, then seminar and committee meetings the rest of the day. Possibly a grad student support group meeting at the end of the day. \n\n**Distractions/Issues/Focus:**\n\nI have a feeling that there are going to be more edits to the revisions I sent my advisor, and that they're going to steamroll over my plans for this week. \n\n**Self-care: What will you do to ensure you take time off and get away from the work?**\n\nGoing to try to get to the gym one night this week.

I started my Ph.D. program, actually, 13 years ago. I made it six weeks and was so miserable I quit after a co-worker (since I was also working full-time) asked me, \"Why do you want a Ph.D.?\" and I realized it had never occurred to me to ask that question. In physics, you see, you're given the message pretty strongly that nothing else matters. Certainly back when I was in undergrad, even though I was in a lovely department, the message is insidious. You keep going to school until you fail out, and that tells you how you should feel about yourself. If you manage not to fail out before the end, congratulations. You can respect yourself enough to show your face in the field and start chasing after the approval of every scientist you meet.\n\nI didn't know how else to feel about school. After I quit, I had to go through a long period of readjusting my identity as someone who doesn't have a Ph.D., and then as someone who is okay with not having a Ph.D., and then as someone who is just okay in general.\n\nEventually, for my career, I realized I needed to specialize in order to progress, so I went back to school to get a Master's in applied math. But the thing was, I was 10 years older, with a spouse and kids and a brand-new diagnosis of ADHD (that would have helped a hell of a lot back in school, had I known), and it was FUN. When I applied for graduation, I was actually sad about all the classes I wouldn't have time to take. That's when I realized I wanted to keep going and I wanted to learn more than I could learn in a class. I knew what I wanted to learn about and I knew I wanted to be the one to learn it instead of waiting for someone else to figure it out. And that's my thesis. I have no idea what I'm going to do after I'm done with the program, since I think my husband will really actually give me a seriously pained look or two if I say I want one more g**d*** degree right now, but I know that, for now, I'm where I want to be, and I know why.\n\nI'm getting my Ph.D. because I'm just not ready to not know exactly how magnetic and gravitational forces make dust fall onto neutron stars after it's been blown off. It's not *a* Ph.D.; it's *my* Ph.D.\n\nEdited to add: There are for sure people who enter the program for the image or the idea that they'll earn some kind of fortune and fame.

I definitely have moments were I have difficulty focusing. On the other hand, I also have moments where I have this crazy hyperfocus. I love pulling all-nighters since there are so little distractions at night.\n\nSome coping methods I have used:\n\n\\- Make realistic deadlines. Planning is very difficult for me. I always seem to underestimate the time it takes to get certain stuff done (not knowing whether it's me working slow or just thinking that certain tasks get done faster). I'm now trying to decompose every smaller task that a certain task includes (e.g. introduction takes looking for literature, reading literature, writing, ...), and plan a crazy amount of time for each task. For example, I've planned three days for my analyses, and I'll plan an extra day for every day that I have other tasks waiting for me (so 3 days or 6 days where I also do some other minor tasks).\n\n\\- Set (small) time slots (like 30mins or an hour) where you turn off all distractions and work an a task. This also means closing e-mail programs, not having toilet breaks (if possible), putting away my smartphone, ... If I think of another task during that timeslot, I'll write it down so it's \"off my mind\".  Getting coffee, mails, toilet breaks etc are reserved for between those time slots. \n\n\\- I just push myself to work on things until they are done if I really have a deadline... Like the allnighters... But I love the feeling of going into hyperfocus and seeing what I can accomplish in \"small\" amounts of time if I truly set my mind to it.\n\n\\- Make sure you have time off. If you do push yourself to a certain limit and put in extra hours, you're allowed to half-ass it the next day. After doing an all-nighter (which would often mean putting in 16 hours and thus 2 working days in one), you're allowed to do next to nothing the next day. I would not be able to get the same amount of focus when I work 2 days instead of working one very long day. So the day after an allnighter, I would sometimes just watch series and do little else work-related apart from checking my mail (if my workload would allow it at the time). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never used medication.

I got diagnosed shortly after starting my PhD, I had been struggling for a while but didn't know why, it was like everything in my life finally made sense. \n\nRight now, I manage mainly with medication and other strategies combined. If your school has them I would recommend a learning strategist, they had tons of experience coaching students with adhd and helping them succeed. \n\nFor example, one of my main struggles is time management. For this I use weekly and daily scheduling. I need to go through my necessary \"to-dos\" every Friday and soft schedule chunks of time for every single one of them throughout my next  week. Then every morning during breakfast I go over what I'm supposed to do that day and set specific times for them. It's not perfect and most of the time I don't follow it 100% but it works better than just having a blank schedule day, being excited because \"today I  can focus on my research!\" and then realizing that I didn't do any research related stuff at the end of the day.\n\nFidget toys are my best friends for sitting through seminars, long meetings and lectures. There's a couple of silent ones that won't drive that much attention but will keep you moving and focused.\n\nIt would definitely wouldn't be possible to do any of this without complementing it with meds.

The year out was really good for me personally--I based my research proposal on my master's dissertation, which allowed me to very confidently claim a gap in the literature for my funding application.\n\nI don't know whether you're less likely to get funding if you apply for it mid-masters--most of my friends have taken a year between the two.

The year out gave me the chance to publish some of my master's research, to get on an organising committee for a conference, and to have a well-researched proposal, all of which contributed to my funding award. Also, because I'd already researched in my field during my dissertation,  I knew which scholars to reach out to as potential supervisors, because I already knew who was writing in the field and would be relevant to me. As a side note--if you did want to put in funding applications for this year, you would want to be reaching out to supervisors now, as they usually (depending on the norms in your field) help you develop your proposal and funding applications strategically to ensure your success.\n\nI would advise strongly against self-funding (especially if you're not a UK/EU citizen)--I have tuition-only funding, and even that is pretty tough at times.

I think that as long as you have research experience and took classes/learned skills that can be applied to your PhD, then it is perfectly fine to go right after undergrad, given you are accepted. I was concerned about it taking 4 years, much longer than a masters, but if you\u2019re really passionate about what you want to research then I think it\u2019s extremely worth it! You definitely have to be independent and willing to put in the hours, but so far it has been a rewarding experience.\nAlso, in the US most PhD\u2019s offer a stipend, whereas for a masters you\u2019ll be paying thousands of dollars to go to school. That also played a roll in my decision to pursue a PhD over a masters, as I get paid (albeit not a ton, but livable) to go to school instead of paying to go to school.

YMMV with this advice, especially if you're at a large state school as they tend to have less flexible administration)\n\nAs someone who's been in almost the exact same position you are describing, right down to considering quitting (I even applied for jobs):\n\nNever give up trying to publish your results/write your dissertation based only on the advice of your advisor. As you have just discovered, your advisor is sometimes the person who knows the least about your research. YOU know much more than them about most of the specifics, and there may be another expert out there who can give you better advice on whatever you don't know. Find that person. Reach out to colleagues, other professors, grad students who do work similar to yours to get second third and fourth opinions on your research. If you have a dissertation committee, reach out to them. Basically, it is up to you to tell your advisor whether or not your research is valid, not the other way around.\n\nI'm also really not sure why your second experiment is being thrown out, but you should defend your work. You worked so hard to get that data, and even if the results are negative or null finding, they are worth something if you used valid methods and can back up your protocols. Dissertation work doesn't have to be the best work you'll ever do. It just has to be passable.  It just needs to get through some form of peer review. And on that note, it's OK if your work doesn't get accepted on first journal submittal. Sometimes you just get crazy reviewers. Sometimes it's the wrong journal. There are a million reasons to get rejected and only a handful of them mean you should never try to publish the work again.\n\n11 months is so close. Don't let your advisor gaslight you into quitting. If you do want to quit and think it's the best thing for your sanity, that's great and you should do it, BUT... it sounds like you are on the fence and that you probably already have enough publishable material for almost a full dissertation. If you're actually that close, you should really really consider trying to complete the degree. \n\nOne more piece of advice: get the administration involved. Go to your department chair, dean of students, etc. and ask for a confidential meeting. Explain the situation, especially whatever work you currently have that you think is dissertation-ready but your advisor doesn't. Explain that you're considering quitting.

I already finished a master\u2019s thesis two times while being depressed, and it were the topics that pulled me through. \n\nThe funny thing is that the topic itself is really depressing. I studied literature and communication and I had experiences with suicidal thoughts and depression. This topic brings it all together, since I am going to find out why people voluntarily watch tragic entertainment... As a means of conquering fear of death or to accept fear of death? During my darkest days, I liked watching \u2018tragic\u2019 movies and shows like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale or Game of Thrones. It was my own coping mechanism. So, I am basically researching my own coping mechanism. My background in literature and communication provide the means to analyze those stories. I just really love storytelling.\n\nSo the topic couldn\u2019t be more perfect, but it can also become depressing and confronting. That\u2019s why I am terrified. I guess I just really like weird things.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/dj9psq/i_got_hired_for_a_phd_position_and_i_am_happy_and/f43we7r/"}, "911": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CoffeeHead22", "Date": 1571346202, "Score": 1, "Body": "I need to leave.

I just lived through this. I kept it together throughout the viva and the celebrations. The next morning I woke up and proceeded to cry all day (like actually 6 hrs) just about everything. I too was given minor corrections but the way they were in the viva was very frustrating. They continuously said I didn't include information that I did. I finally just opened the thesis and started pointing it out to them... that just annoyed them. When it came to the end, they were just like \"so 'obviously' you passed, but we wanted to give you the option of 3 months or 1 month for corrections\"... After a major internal panic I said one month, and told them I would start on them ASAP to have them finished in the month. I told them I'd taken off the next two days of work (so I could celebrate) and that I would start the first thing the following day...

The first year was such a wild ride! Things now are an infinity times better so don\u2019t lose hope!\n\nOk so when I started, I was legit lost. I had notions but they weren\u2019t enough (my masters and PhD share some methods but they are very very different in topics) and I felt like I was in the ocean, knowing how to swim but suddenly having forgotten how. \n\nHere are the steps I took:\n\n1) Asked for feedback from both all of my supervisors. That took on different forms: informal meetings and formal committee meetings. They were very helpful even though I felt awful directly after. But they allowed me to know what I\u2019m lacking (for me, Work independence and needing to brush up on some fundamentals). It also allowed me to know my strengths (it\u2019s not all bad ;)).\n\n2) Working (hard!) on getting better. For me it consisted on reading articles, taking courses and most importantly planning things by myself without consulting anyone. It was quite interesting for me because I was great during my bachelor and also my masters but when I arrived to the PhD, nothing prepared me to the reality of it.\n\nI realized that with time I started thinking of the project as MY project, and not a project I\u2019m just working on. This happened around a year in or so. Sometimes I feel slow, and that\u2019s ok. I just have to plan accordingly.  I recently started planning my weeks day by day, and I have a plan for the next 10 months. I do check ins with myself every 2 weeks: did I do what I had to do during that time? Why and why not? How to move forward?\n\nI realized that overall I enjoy the project. Some parts I love much more than others (I prefer analysis over lab stuff). \n\nI am lucky because my supervisors really want to help. One of them is very negative so I avoid him because I felt he was bringing me down; things also got better for me when I stopped going to him at every single thing!\n\nI also stopped comparing myself. Different people know different things, and everyone brings something new on the table. If you\u2019re unhappy with where you are (like I was), you can always get better if you want to. If you feel like you cannot even if you want to, maybe try therapy to rule out other things like depression or anxiety or OCD (I am going waaaaay ahead of myself but just to write it out). If you realize that you just don\u2019t like it, leaving is always an option and you shouldn\u2019t feel stuck. \n\nMy point is, if you want to and if your supervisors are nice and are willing  to help, it will get better!\n\nSorry this is so long, I hope you find it helpful!

Although, my supervisor is a sweet person, it seems like they do not care about me outside me producing publications for them. I told them about my stress; and yet, I heard nothing. I had a paper published, and they keep asking me to send the proof because they have to upload it to a uni server that measures \u2018their output\u2019. \n\nNow my story is not yours. \n\nYet, I will turn to K E Logstrup, Danish philosopher for a second. He says:\n\n\nTrust is not of our own making; it is given. Our life is so constituted that it cannot be lived except as one person lays him or herself open to another person and puts him or herself into that person\u2019s hands either by showing or claiming trust. By our very attitude to another we help to shape that person\u2019s world. By our attitude to the other person we help to determine the scope and hue of his or her world; we make it large or small, bright or drab, rich or dull, threatening or secure. We help to shape his or her world not by theories and views but by our very attitude towards him or her. Herein lies the unarticulated and one might say anonymous demand that we take care of the life which trust has placed in our hands.\n\nHe sums this up explaining that you cannot engage with another person without holding some of their life in your hands. In the case of a supervisor, and something as momentous as a PhD, I dare to suggest that they hold quite a substantial part in their hands. For better or for worse. \n\nNow, how do I deal with it? I meditate, I do yoga, and other sports. It makes me happy in the head. I even took up Muay Thai a bit to get some aggression out. I also spend time with friends, partner, and family. And most importantly, I allow myself to be frustrated at times. \n\nFrom meditation and yoga I often try to externalise it. What are you resisting in your life right now? I ask myself those words. I note my thoughts, feelings and emotions. Label them if they fit in a box. And try to let them pass like clouds in a sky or cars on a busy road. There are good days and bad days. \n\nNow, asides from my self care, I\u2019m also a person who stands up for what is right. So, that meant that I have had conflict and I\u2019ve raised conflicts with my supervisors before. For better or for worse. I think it is essential to have clarity between me and my supervisors. \n\nHopefully, some of these words will resonate with you! The relationship with your supervisor is critical. And you\u2019re an absolute superstar for raising it. Remember that. And you\u2019re a mega boss for doing a PhD in the first place.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dk4kzx/what_to_do_about_an_unsupportive_advisor/f4b75n9/"}, "1001": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "berylliumwages", "Date": 1571509052, "Score": 1, "Body": "In which country?

One solution to this is \\`git lfs\\` (lfs = large file storage). If you want to use github, then they cap how much space you can use for free, but if you have a local git server, then this is probably not a problem. With git lfs you specify which files are large files, and then they are handled differently.\n\nFor structuring the number of repositories, I would try to think about, what is a self contained unit. Try to track down the completely self contained projects first. If other projects depend on these, then the simple solution is to keep a copy in that repository, but that is inefficient (and it becomes more of a hurdle to track changes). It is better to include the other repo as a submodule. Then you can develop against a fixed version of the dependency and update as needed.\n\nIn general, starting to use git is a slightly expensive upfront cost, but it really helps for making more reproducible research. It also forces you to structure your work more. This skill also transfers very well outside academia.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dmckgq/structuring_phd_folder_git/f4zdtq3/"}, "1176": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SupSquark", "Date": 1571907826, "Score": 5, "Body": "Are there any good resources for learning git?

For example: I have a folder for Dissertation, with subfolders for the intro and three chapters. Then each chapter has folders for intro, methods, etc. I sort papers to where I think they belong. Papers also go in a second folder titled \"reading list\" if I don't have time to skim them right away or think they need a more detailed read.\n\nI think this really slowed me down at the beginning, since I often had trouble keeping track of what I had already read.

I would recommend making a list of the techniques you've done/seen and a list of the other techniques you need for *your* proposed project, and present that list to your adviser to help figure out how to start making it happen. \n\nGenerally, if you go to a professor and say \"What do I do?\" their answer will either be completely generic e.g. \"Keep studying\" or some oddly specific thing that they happen to be interested in that day, but won't really help your thesis. The more specific your questions are, the more help they can be.\n\nFinally, \n&gt;A research tech started around the same time as me and he has been trained in everything in his first month and is flying it, while I'm mostly at my desk trying to figure out exactly what I'm meant to be doing.\n\nThat's the difference between a PHD and a tech. Expect to spend a lot of time at your desk figuring out what you should be doing. Right now, that seems lame because you're trying to figure out things that the people around you already know. This is part of your training. By the end of your project, you will be back in this position, sitting at your desk trying to figure out what to do, but you will be trying to design an experiment that no human has ever done before.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dotzjc/im_struggling_with_the_independence_of_new_phd/f5qpu9x/"}, "1442": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "darkmoonsatellite", "Date": 1572382282, "Score": 1, "Body": "thank you", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dm8fty/phd_in_computer_science_or_information_security/f5qsi34/"}, "1443": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "iamalyssalee", "Date": 1572383622, "Score": 2, "Body": "I think it is!

You just have to embrace a syntax like \\\\section{my section name} or \\\\cite{my citation} or \\\\textit{my text in italic} in the TeX document.

I had an embarrassingly low quant score but a few years of research experience with two publications and one in preparation. I applied to about 7 PhD programs and only got into one which is where I am now.\n\nMy first piece of advice to you is to apply as broadly as possible. Don't get cocky like I did and only apply to top tier programs. Apply to at least 10 programs at the minimum and make the top 3 your reach schools (Ivy League or whatever). The bottom 3 should be low tier schools and the rest should be middle tier.\n\nMy second piece of advice (and arguably the most important) is to network. Make sure your desired advisors know exactly who you are before you even apply. Email them asking them questions about their research (they usually love talking about themselves and their work) and propose some relevant ideas of your own such as how you could extend their theory using your own research or whatever. Ask your current lab head who their colleagues are and find out if they are looking for students.\n\nIf your Quant score is low but you have great grades in your math classes, have your letter writers mention this or have them praise your stats knowledge. \n\nI wouldn't worry about coming from a clinical background. A lot of social psychologists come from clinical backgrounds and there is a lot of overlap. Try to identify the overlap between your prior research and the research of your potential advisor. You will need to tailor your statement of purpose differently for every program you apply to in order to match the interests of your desired mentor.\n\nSpeaking of which, your statement of purpose should convey that you live for this line of research. You should have a narrative where your entire life has shaped your interests to want to study your topic of interest (which, again, should overlap with your desired mentor's interests). What your potential advisors want know is that there is no chance that you will quit. They want to make sure you can handle the insane work load without breaking and that you are intrinsically motivated to the point where failure is not an option. They are really hiring you for a difficult job that only few people are capable of handling. Show them you are that person.\n\nI hope this was helpful. I want to add that a PhD program is the hardest, most stressful, humbling thing I've ever done but I love what I do and am still incredibly thankful my advisor gave me a chance. If you really love research then it's worth it.

Can I ask if you got any feedback from the schools that didn\u2019t accept you? I agree that networking is important, over he past week I\u2019ve emailed essentially every professor I hope to work with but I\u2019ve only heard back from two, and I\u2019m not sure how I should take that. I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re busy and that they\u2019ll get back to me eventually but I\u2019m not sure. I checked their lab websites to make sure they were ok with being contacted, some I contacted through their lab page, so I guess I\u2019ll wait and see. I\u2019ve also tried emailing students in the programs and again only heard back from two, so idk if they\u2019re just extremely busy or uninterested in helping.\n\nDid you find that the research experience you had was low compared to others or at a good level for someone entering the PhD? I really want to sway the professor I mentioned earlier but I\u2019m wondering if my experience is simply too low to make a strong case. I think the best thing I have aside from the publications is a grant that directly relates to what her lab is working on, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll try to highlight that in my SoP.\n\nThank you for the advice on the SoP, in my head I\u2019ve been trying to create a succinct yet compelling narrative that shows how my background and experiences led me to want to research this specific topic in the foreseeable future. I\u2019m aware that I have to tailor my essay to each school so I\u2019m hoping I do that justice.\n\nCan I ask, what part of the PhD is extremely stressful and humbling? I\u2019m sure the work load is intense and immense but does the for it not help outweigh that or is it really just way more than expected? What could you point out to me that someone not in a PhD may not be aware of, something that I could highlight in my statement to show that I\u2019m committed to even the most difficult aspects of pursuing this type of program?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dpl23d/social_psychology_phd/f5yck92/"}, "1542": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "aknb", "Date": 1572555328, "Score": 2, "Body": "Tree butcher", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dplqdg/how_do_you_keep_track_of_the_research_papers/f5yfe98/"}, "1543": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nopstoc", "Date": 1572555501, "Score": 20, "Body": "This is not a metaphor im realistically considering joining the circus", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dpr3l6/phd_4_life/f5yfsrj/"}, "1544": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "aknb", "Date": 1572556921, "Score": 1, "Body": "I like this approach. \ud83d\udc4d", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dof930/how_many_hours_do_you_work_a_week/f5yizpg/"}, "1545": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "aknb", "Date": 1572558121, "Score": 1, "Body": "dad = dead at dusk\n\nOr\n\ndad = more traditional I impregnated someone ?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dof930/how_many_hours_do_you_work_a_week/f5ylptb/"}, "1546": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "aknb", "Date": 1572558451, "Score": 2, "Body": "Realistic, what's with all the down votes?
