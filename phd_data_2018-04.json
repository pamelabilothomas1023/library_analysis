I spent my youth playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons and eating pizza with a group of friends who I haven't seen in 10 years, and pursuing a career I would eventually abandon. Was that a waste? From a utilitarian point of view, that might not have been the most productive time, and I would have been better off perhaps starting grad school earlier. In terms of making fond memories, though, it wasn't a waste at all. So, it's all about perspective! Just realize that you can't predict how much of a \"waste\" your current efforts are, and whether you'll look back on them in the same way you do right now.\n\nI also don't believe that life has any inherent purpose.

Classes or research are going to follow you home from time to time, but you need to be able to say it's time for me time. It's a good time to build up your own hobbies, in part because you really need them to get through a graduate degree mentally. Some can be more at home things like picking up music, but others should get you out a bit too and potentially meeting people outside of work.\n\nA lot of people at 22 are essentially starting from scratch after college regardless of grad school or not. I started grad school at the same age you did, and you won't be wasting your youth away if you make of point of creating at boundaries for research work (though often needing to be flexible) and working on other aspects of your life.

Mine was really rough on the mental well-being, but you're at the point it's almost more work to up and quit than to wrap things up. It's not so much staying sane, but keeping things cobbled together enough to keep plugging away.\n\nI like the spite idea others have mentioned, but the big thing that hits is the anxiety. \"What if I stay up until 3 tonight? Will I get the chapter done and be finally be done earlier? Crap, it's 10pm and I haven't eaten since 10am, what can I make quick? I need to eat better.\" It's really easy to start down a path like that and worry yourself the point you say aren't getting any more work done, followed by procrastinating on some really extended break time on reddit or Netflix. Still thinking about research or writing when you go to bed doesn't help either. You're probably going through it already, but the last half year isn't the normal rollercoaster of anxiety, it's just a steady increase at already high intensity that can weigh on you more and more each night you go to bed.\n\nSo here's a few things I did:\n\n* **Sleep**. Try to stick to schedule and don't shortchange yourself. You'll get more done in a few hours while being well rested than a whole day after doing an all-nighter. It doesn't matter if you're stressed out, just go to bed and try to sleep. If you can't sleep, listen to music or something at least to do something not work related.\n\n* **Screens off**. Related to sleep, but before you to go to bed, try to give yourself and hour where *all* computers, TVs, phones, etc. are off. Issues with screen lights affecting sleep aside, you need something to dial your head down before bed. Give something to signal that it's the end of the day.\n\n* **Procrastinate**. Your mind is going to wander. That's fine. Just don't start doing it and realize four hours later you've been engrossed in r/scp or something like that. It helps to get away from the screen and go outside. Go clean a fishtank or something. Plan a vacation after your defense (though try not to daydream too much). If you're really going to be on a website like reddit, set an alarm so you can lose track of time for just a little bit without shooting yourself in the foot.\n\n* **Just do it**. Writing anxiety is often your biggest enemy, so the more you can say screw it and flop at least something out there, you're doing good. You can always improve on it later. I can remember many times getting comments back on a draft and worrying about how to address them, not getting out of bed because I didn't want to go near tackling them even though it was on my mind constantly, and sometimes wasting a week or more not even getting work done on a chapter. Once I sat down and got to it though, it sometimes only took a day to get everything addressed. If you're really worrying yourself into a cycle of anxiety over actually starting something  and worrying because you haven't started it, alcohol on occasion does help give a more \"to hell with it\" mentality to get over the hump.\n\n* **Get out of bed**. Some days you really just don't have the willpower get out of bed and face your dissertation writing. I'm all for mental health days, but it's also really easy to just want to stay in bed when you are writing at home. It'll hit you later once you start worrying that you wasted half the day. I too many days where I did exactly that. Go make some pancakes or something so you can at least say you made something cool today.\n\n* **Get some kind of coping mechanism**. Some days, you're going to be stressed out, pulled every which way in your head, and nothing you do is going to change that. Have something when you're not working so you can detach from that. Maybe it's just going to a park bench and watching squirrels. Just have something where you can acknowledge you're stretched thin and can let your head run wild while you're zoned out doing something else. I took the meditation route. Instead of holding back all the stressful stuff, I basically let my head go into high rpms to the point I eventually was too mentally exhausted to worry anymore for the day while basically ignoring all that going on in my head while I was meditating. Others probably have different approaches, but being able to get in your own head (and out of it) is a good skill to have.\n\n* **Keep a weekend**. It doesn't have to be an actual weekend, but try to keep at least one day that is absolutely not a writing day. Sunday was mine.\n\n* **Make leftovers**. For some reason, thinking I needed to stop writing and take time to cook stressed me out, and I like cooking. If you can make soup, spaghetti, etc. for leftovers, you can just pop it in the microwave. Just knowing you have food ready to go can help a lot.\n\nNone of these are really big things, but that's part of the reason. Keep little things that you can do, and they can help keep your mind from jumping around finding other stuff to worry about.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/897ady/how_dodid_you_motivate_yourself_during_the_final/dwy1rwf/"}, "159": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "terfmermaid", "Date": 1523064646, "Score": 1, "Body": "Out of curiosity, did he have any idea of the proportion for accepted w/ revisions and accepted outright?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/8acfu0/submitted_my_phd_with_one_shockingly_bad_chapter/dwy31m9/"}, "160": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "purpleoctopuppy", "Date": 1523067561, "Score": 1, "Body": "He didn't tell me if he did, sorry.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/8acfu0/submitted_my_phd_with_one_shockingly_bad_chapter/dwy5mv8/"}, "161": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "FreyjaVar", "Date": 1523088770, "Score": 6, "Body": "Had the same experience PhD in biochemistry/molecular biology.

Unlike undergraduate projects, your PhD projects will extend for longer periods of times (years sometimes) and you will have to juggle between them a lot. 2) Find a hobby and exercise frequently. 3) Talk to senior graduate students in your surrounding and ask them about their experience, especially about their struggles. This can help you manage your expectations and size your goals properly. 4) Don't compare yourself to the stars of your department or university, especially when you think about how many publications you want to have.

PhDs are tough at the best of times, and supervisors can be difficult. Trouble with the supervisor (especially high expectations) must be the most common and significant source of stress for PhD students, and with life and death in the balance it's 10 times worse for you. Facing a health issue isn't uncommon especially with the stress of PhDs but I'm sorry to hear you've been hit with a double whammy.\n\nI don't know if you saw but Nature have had some research and editorials on the terrible state of mental health amongst PhD students. Pressure, the inevitable feelings of inadequacy, and perhaps most significantly the enormous uncertainty at the end all mean that your poor state of mind is far from uncommon. In fact, it's the natural reaction to your circumstances. Sounds like you acknowledge that and you're getting some help.\n\nFortunately, especially in Australia, things have moved on a bit since the bad old days. There should be more people you can talk to and get help from, and even more resources for your PhD supervisor to draw on to help manage the situation. If you haven't tapped all these resources (e.g. university and faculty as well as departmental) it would be good to do so.\n\nYou also have to figure out what's actually possible for you. How much work, what timeline is something you can accomplish and have some peace of mind? The deadline caused by your supervisor's illness is something very sad that's happened to them. That doesn't really change what's possible for you. It's just bad luck. If it creates an impossible pressure, then at some point you have to do yourself the favour of saying out loud: This schedule is not possible for me to achieve for these reasons. So what's the best way to work around that limitation?\n\nTrying the impossible will just make you and others around you miserable. What's the point of that? Does the world need another mathematician so badly that you should risk your health? The PhD is really for you and your life.

I chose to do my PhD here because I met a lecturer who I really connect with on a research level and wanted to continue working with her; I feel like her approach to work and her interests line up with mine well. I have had opportunities to teach and massive support when it comes to publishing and giving papers at conferences. I love doing my PhD here, but that being said, I do have a few complaints that I believe the US system does differently.  \n\n\nAs you wrote in your post, it can be desperately lonely in the UK. My university has an incredible research culture which encourages collaboration with other students and academics and still it is an isolating experience. Perhaps having taught time would be a way to circumvent that, but I'm not sure. Either way you need a good support base to avoid how isolating it can be. \n\n\nThe other thing I find difficult about PhDs in the UK, especially in the humanities which is my field, is the pressure to finish in 3 years if you are a full time student. In the US, as I have been told by multiple lecturers who were born in the US and did their PhDs there, there is far less of an expectation to finish that quickly, and much more of a focus on developing your research to the point where you are ready for the academic job market, if you are so inclined. I am due to finish this year and I feel entirely unprepared for job searches and feel like I am always going to be behind other applicants in terms of things I can put on my CV, because I've only had 3 years to develop myself in addition to independent research. \n\n\nWhile this all sounds VERY negative (apologies!) I do genuinely enjoy my PhD programme at my UK university. I wish there was some sort of in between with aspects of both the US and the UK system which reconciled my issues. I don't have any answers for what you should do, but I think both systems have their pros and cons and you should absolutely take as much time as necessary to decide which would work better for you. \n\nGood luck with your decision!

I\u2019m getting my PhD at an R1 (research first) university in the US, so my perspective might be of some use to you. My institute requires at least one directed teaching course and many students are funded through graduate teaching assistantships, so if you are looking for more teaching experience while doing research, you can certainly get it done at an R1 institute. That being said, in most PhD programs here (or at least in my field), you are still expected to come in with a research project or at least a research idea that you work on through your first and second year. What ends up happening is that you are expected to teach, take a full course load during your first and second year, and make progress on your research all at the same time. As a result, very few PhD students here finish within four years. In one aspect, this is good because it gives you more time to learn and be trained in different techniques and gives you more time to publish. On the other hand, depression and anxiety are extremely high among PhD students here, especially in their first and second years. There\u2019s also a percentage of PhD students who lose steam entirely while writing their dissertations and quit right before the finish line due to burnout and poor job prospects.

I dont know anyone who truly read and applied everything in those books, everyone has their own style but here are some useful tips.
