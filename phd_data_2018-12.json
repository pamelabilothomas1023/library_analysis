Before I got pregnant I talked with many women faculty in my department who had kids, and they all said that if they could have done it while in school (as opposed to while trying for tenure) they would have.  Two other good friends in my program also had babies while ABD and it worked out great for them.  But if you're going into industry/government/whatever, you may find there's way better accommodations (like, actual fucking parental leave) for having a kid once you're done.\n\nI will say-- don't underestimate how tired you will be while pregnant.  You might have a unicorn pregnancy with no nausea/fatigue/heartburn and I hope you do!  But you probably won't.  If you're thinking about going on the academic job market in the next couple of years, pregnancy/tiny baby can also make that process more complicated (fly-outs, conference interviews, etc).\n\nHaving a baby slowed my progress down by a year, easily.

My partner went through the loss of two jobs and some major health issues while I was completing my PhD. He had several symptoms of depression and anxiety. I encouraged him to seek mental health services and he did go to therapy for a little while. Things didn't really improve until we moved (lower cost of living area reduced rent stress and commuting time) and he found a good job. Things are better now. His depression was more situational (through protracted) than clinical (i.e. chemical inbalance) \n\nSeveral folks have made comments about how a PhD is hard on the partner. It can be, but don't be too quick to peg your partner's issues on your program or your stress level. They are an adult. While your situation and mood will impact them, that doesn't make you (or your program) responsible for their depression. (Benefit of the doubt assuming you're not making things hard on them unnecessarily.)\n\nAre there other factors that might contribute to how they are feeling? Talk to them. What are they worried or depressed about? They may not even know right away or be able to explain it. Just stay open and supportive and in time, you can help them figure out out. Encourage them to seek professional help. Respect their choice about it, but also realize that when someone is clinically depressed, they may genuinely want help, but actually picking up the phone and jumping through insurance hurdles may be too daunting. They may need your support on some of the logistics, but if they have to want help.\n\nPatience. Support. Respect. Communication. When communicating, pay close attention to body language and facial expression. Depressed folks will try to not be a \"burden\" or downplay their symptoms, but demeanor can convey a lot.

These are my deadlines. This is my workload. This is what my stress level will be. This is how I cope with stress best. This is how you can support me. This is what I can offer to do for/with you. And then asking for reciprocation. What do you expect? What do you need me to do? What causes your stress level to go up? Down? Where can we meet in the middle?

What are non-stupid questions and how to be someone who asks non-stupid questions?\" **This is not about being dumb,** it's about being dependent.\n\nYou say it took you this long to figure out what the project was and where it was going. Why did you eventually figure that out on your own, but felt the need to get direction on specific tasks? You aren't an undergrad that gets handed a set of instructions and is expected to just do it. You are becoming a fully fledged researcher, and that means understanding *why* you take every step. So how come the only thing you cared about understanding was the specific execution?\n\nTL;DR: The problem is that up to now you haven't seemed to care about \"why.\" So start asking \"why,\" rather than \"how.\"", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/a3acfr/what_are_intelligentcritical_questions/eb4ucuc/"}, "84": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "miskoki", "Date": 1544017704, "Score": 2, "Body": "This is so true.

It\u2019s the nature of imposter syndrome. \n\nWhen I have these thoughts (and I have them extremely frequently, in the exact same form as you described quite well) i think of David foster Wallace\u2019s this is water speech (apologies to those who find it cliche). Among many other things in that insightful speech, at one point he talks about how we all end up worshiping *something*, and what we worship greatly impacts our sense of self.  I think it\u2019s worth quoting at length:\n\n\u201cIf you worship money and things \u2014 if they are where you tap real meaning in life \u2014 then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It\u2019s the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already \u2014 it\u2019s been codified as myths, proverbs, clich\u00e9s, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power \u2014 you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart \u2014 you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.\u201d\n\nI think of that often when my imposter syndrome is particularly bad. It\u2019s not a product of how smart I am or aren\u2019t, or if I can ever succeed. Sure they might matter, and there may be some relevant metric. But I\u2019m feeling this way by because of that. I\u2019m feeling this way because I\u2019ve invested so much of my self worth in this one, single, feeling, and a capricious one at that. \n\nAnother example, to make things quite a bit more concrete and personal: both my uncle and father are academics. My uncle has had a fine career but not a particularly decorated one. My father has had a very impressive and successful and influential career in his field. My uncle is unquestionably a smarter person than my father. He went to better undergrad, better grad school, and had much better prospects in his first years as an academic. This is not throwing shade, but he\u2019s just a sharper more cuttingly intelligent reader and person. My dad got rejected by 16/17 grad schools. Got kicked out of grad school at one point, to be let back in. Did not have an impressive job starting out and could not get grants. But he stuck with it, kept working and trying and trying again. And over time he\u2019s come to have a massive career with a cv (no joke) 70+ pages. \n\nThe old adage about 90% effort and all that still matters and is still relevant. Don\u2019t forget that this is a job, and we should treat it like a job, for our career\u2019s sake and our sanity.

During the first three weeks, I showed up at his office and he was nowhere to be found. I remember going there every half hour for the next two hours or so and then giving up. From the fourth week onwards, I did not show up and for months he never brought up the fact that we were supposed to have weekly meetings that we weren't having.\n\nFast forward two years, I'm on my PhD and he brings up this amazing idea that he thinks makes students much more productive: weekly meetings. I almost stabbed him with my pen. He also incentivized me to talk about my progress and ask questions through audio messages (WhatsApp). I sent him three audios, which a month later I realized he never heard.\n\nI am two months away from my preliminary exams and said to him that it was safer for me to quit the program, since I didn't feel I was being productive and thought I had little to show in the exam. He then finally took a look at the state of my research, gave me a lot of valuable advice and now I have a plan for the next two months.\n\nHe justified himself telling me he thought I was a more independent student who would conjure flawless research from thin air. My side of the story is that, after some time, I never had any hope of having meetings with him and decided to just wing it. Of course I didn't tell him that because the asymmetry of power between us makes me unable to be truthful on the matter. Now he tells me there is time to fix the problem if I give up on taking time off at the end of the year. I feel like a loser trying to catch up on lost time.\n\nMy advice to you: don't be me. Advisory meetings are very important for you as a student. In them, you're able to validate the work you're doing, plan deliveries for the next meeting, ask questions and whatnot. If your advisor starts to bamboozle you, bring up the matter or just ask for another one. I've seen sadistic advisors say during their students viva that they never saw what their students were working on, so they wouldn't vouch for it.

Not that you should ignore them, but it would be a great help if you can know what you could get out of those courses that could be most helpful in your future work. That way, you could stress less about low grades if you know you have enough to get you running. For example, it could be enough for you to understand some machine learning concepts, but you don't really need to be able to solve X number of problems in a Y minute exam when you could allocate more time should you encounter similar stuff through the course of your research. It could be hard to know what is important for your work, though. So treasure your good relationship with your advisor. Your advisor could help you with that, or could point you to persons who could. Be and respectful and honest to them (depending on context, these might be hard to decipher), and always keep them posted on your progress. It could personally help you, too.

For the ones where I had to write a research proposal, I already knew which professor and the general theme under which I would be hired as a \"project\" PhD student. This means your supervisor is also essentially your employer, and you have to conduct your research within the constraints of that original project framework. Essentially, before they hire you, they already had the funding for a grant they wrote and now they are hiring you to do some of that research. The other way is if you just apply generally to a department, in which case you can choose, but try and align your ideas with what at least two professors are doing at the department with the hopes that one of them can be your supervisor.\n2. I contacted a bunch of professors before. From the US I only ever received one email back. From the EU, I noticed that I kept moving through to interviews then not getting the position as they already pre-filled it with someone from the department already (a masters student or admin person wanting to get a PhD). So then I started emailing professors before the application was due and asking them straight up \"I have had the experience of getting to interviews only to find out the position was pre-filled, so is this a genuine vacancy?\" The first professor i did that to was honest with me and it was the PhD position I ended up taking.\n3.

Keeping your supervisor in the loop is the best thing you can do. Another thing that is common with new students is not understanding what counts as an accomplishment.  From your post, in the last month, you have:\n\na) Improved your understanding of the underlying theory\n\nb) Researched and learned new concepts from various sources\n\nc) Performed modeling experiments of applicability of the newly learned theory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that is just from your post... just because what you DID accomplish isn't what your goal was for the month doesn't mean you didn't accomplish anything.  Learning theory and understanding it is a HUGE part of the PhD process, and to be honest you will be doing the same thing for however many years your are in the program.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional general advice, do NOT be afraid to talk to a supervisor about something that went wrong / deadline missed / failed experiment / etc.  Bring it up, own it, and do NOT make excuses.  While they are factors, \"I didn't have enough time / Someone else needed help and distracted me / I had a test\" etc are not how you should approach it.

The books are what you read after to get more detailed nuance of the methods.\n\nThought 2: Sometimes, especially in a technical paper, identifying errors in the methods used or assumptions made takes a lot of in depth understanding of the field.

There may be important nuances (eg, you may need to include Bonferroni corrections, etc etc) that completely invalidate your conclusions if they are missed, especially if any of the comparisons are within-subject (before vs after, etc) which introduces significant correlation (and thus needs to be considered when calculating confidence intervals).\n\nEdit:  And I can't stress highly enough that you should develop a statistical analysis plan BEFORE running the experiment, which goes into detail like, \"we plan to compare the average task completion time for people with/without a college degree using a two-sided t-test.

Each school should also have an academic advisor, and while it's likely that they'll advise you to take more manageable courses (your sport will be a full-time job), you'll want to find a school that will let you balance a rigorous schedule with your sport. Some will, and some may advise against it, which is a risk that they may not support you missing a practice for a mandatory class. Alternatively, you could just take easy classes and wait for graduate school to dive in - it's really up to you and your path. \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nMy first three years, I was 100% team activities before school. By my fourth year (we actually won the national championship that year), I started taking school more seriously, which meant that I needed to take a course to graduate that required I miss practice every other Thursday night. Having an ambitious undergrad degree can do that to you, so on your visits to the schools let the coaches know that you want to talk to the departments you're interested in enrolling with. Some will be amenable to student-athletes (my school was), while others could care less. Getting a sense of that early on, wherever you go, will be a big help. More than once I had to explain to a professor why I needed to turn assignments due in March in either in February or April, because we were on the road as a team 75% of the time in March. Having an athletics department that you feel comfortable going to for help should be a priority when you visit those schools as you make a decision. Some will say, \"Whatever you need, we'll help you with\", while others will say, \"Why don't you just enroll in Communications?\". \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, if the NFL is a realistic option for you, you're going to want to be busting your ass in the gym or on the field every minute you're not sleeping, eating, or in class. I knew I wasn't going pro, so I took internships in the summers. Had I wanted to play professionally after college, that would've been a bad idea. Summer workouts are critical for team bonding, for conditioning, and for coaches to get a good feel for their players. Realize that you may need to, at some point, choose between being a professional athlete and being a professional academic, and choosing to do both may close one or both doors. Advice we received from an NBA scout to this effect was to \"Unpack your bags\". What he meant was be present in the place your at, give it your all, and if you do well then things will work out and the next opportunities will open up when the time is right. If you're worried about paying for grad school now and working summer jobs, you may miss out critical preparation time where the other guys at your position earn your spot. \r\n\r\nAlso, as far as PhDs go, those are usually fully- or at least partially-funded. I personally took out a lot of student loans in graduate school for my Masters, but my PhD has been fully-funded for 3 years, and in my fourth year now I have a full-time job that aligns perfectly with my studies. So again, there are options out there. But having been in your shoes, I'd highly recommend doing your homework on each school that's offered you a scholarship to see which programs are a fit. If the NFL works, great, you're set. If it doesn't, have a plan (which may include going to a school with a PhD program you'd be interested in enrolling in down the road). But from experience, to be successful at your sport, expect 99% of your time to be dictated by your team. It's a grind, but it can be a blast if you have fun and take it as it comes.

Often economists just take data that is publicly available, like inflation data that is published by national governments.\n\nMath: if you want a PhD then you have to learn some pretty advanced math: algebra, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis. It's a bit intimidating, but if you keep working at it and try hard it is doable. Most people aren't good at math, you get better by practicing it just like anything else.\n\nProfessors do not care if you attend a class you aren't enrolled in.

I\u2019m angry at the system.  The academic world is often unnecessarily belittling to graduate students with far too much demoralization and not enough encouragement (at least from the parts I\u2019ve seen - I\u2019m at a major land grant state university).  It doesn\u2019t need to be that way and often promotes competition rather than collaboration.  I\u2019ve accomplished far more by seeking out and nourishing my own collaborators and connections (within the university, at other universities, and in the private sector) than I did relying on my advisor.  \n\nThis has become a bit of a rant, I\u2019m sorry.  I\u2019m defending my dissertation this spring.  I still don\u2019t know if it was worth it and I\u2019ve had to rely on myself for almost every part of this (very little help from my advisor and my research was self-funded) which makes me a bit bitter.  But, despite all of that, I worked the system, managed to get into some big international conferences, and from that managed to meet some extraordinary people from around the world and with whom I\u2019m now collaborating.  So there have been some amazing things, but that\u2019s more recently.  \n\nThere were lots of times when I was going to quit because I didn\u2019t see how what I was doing aligned with my goals.  It took me 3 years to convince my advisor that my ideas were valid and he has since reorganized his entire lab around my work due to the influx of interest from applicants.  I\u2019m bitter and resentful and honestly struggle some days to be optimistic.  Then again, I don\u2019t like the academic environment and plan on focusing on the private sector when I\u2019m finished so, with that in mind, my perspective may not apply.

You will have periods of time where you work 7 days a week for months. More than half of PhD students develop clinical depression and anxiety. You should not pursue a PhD to make good money. It is generally not a great pathway for that, and there are certainly easier ways to do that if that is important to you. Will it lead to a fulfilling career? Well that largely goes back to what I said regarding research. It isn't for everyone. Without the passion for the research, you'll either flame out or be miserable. \n\nI don't say any of this to be glib. I just can't over emphasize how important exploring this decision is - and making sure you want to do it for the right reasons. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't - I like the work I'm doing but I don't love it, and for that the costs are just too high. And I say this as someone who has been successful thus far and is fairly advanced in my program. Just because you have the capability to, still doesn't mean you should. In my opinion, PhDs are well suited only for very particular types of people.
