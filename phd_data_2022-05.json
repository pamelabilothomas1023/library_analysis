You have already chosen to step out of the limiting world that your mind has so diligently created for you.\n\nThough I'm not a PhD myself, I've been in mental turmoil before like so many of them. I'd like to share with you my learnings and what has certainly helped me get out of my head and stay out until it's clean enough to go back to!\n\nMy learnings about relationships -\n\n\\- It wasn't until I had suffered in pain for two years, that I realized I lacked the mother of all relationships - a healthy relationship with myself.   \n I'd encourage you watch the youtube talks by Guy Winch, especially the one titled \"How to practice emotional first aid | Guy Winch\". Practicing emotional hygiene, as he beautifully puts it, is the first step in caring for yourself &amp; thus laying the foundation for a healthy relationship with yourself. Like so many of us, I believed she was the love I'd yearned for all my years. Boy was I wrong!  I learned that to love was in fact an ability that I'd always had in myself but just hadn't realized it. The moment I understood it, there was no more falling in love! Only raising above and growing! Until you realize that, become stable as a person (emotionally, mentally &amp; physically) &amp; start enjoying your life as-is (through singlehood) you're not going to be able to attract &amp; keep someone similar in your life. You're still fairly young &amp; have a lot of time to work on yourself. \n\n\\- Believing someone else is going to complete me(and miraculously fix my issues) only led to a frustrating co-dependent relationship that, in retrospect, was bound to collapse at some point.   \nNo matter our conditioning, we are complete human beings. We may not realize it yet. In fact, only when we feel so complete that we want to share the overflowing joy, fun, and happiness with someone, can we really be ready for a relationship with that someone.\n\n\\- Identifying with my idea/image (subtle but crucial) about that person left me to feel lost when that image was shattered.   \nNo matter the depths of our love for someone, we should never confuse them for our individual identity as a person (or a human) and shouldn't become their either! When that happens it is no longer love - a messy attachment. Attachments will drag us down with them and keep us in the vicious cycle of identification-incompleteness-pain-suffering. Love, when true, fosters empathy, affection &amp; most importantly freedom.\n\n\\- Love does not always mean living together. Sometimes (as tough as it may be) it is in the ability to let them choose what's best for them - even if it means letting them go. Remember freedom? Yep. \n\nI also understand you've had a difficult upbringing. It can be certainly paralyzing to think about. But I urge you to consider a counselor who can walk you through it &amp; help you unwind any complicated knots that may be preventing you from moving on in life. \n\nOpening up to a professional can certainly help you forge ahead in life and work/study. You'll do well in your PhD I'm sure. \n\nAbove all, don't take life too seriously!  It's best to have fun while the journey lasts! What else are we going to do?!\n\nFeel free to PM me if you need any further help.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ubjapl/unable_to_cope_up_with_life_or_work/i6xcka8/"}, "103": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1651425979, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

Is it the project? Or because you don\u2019t want to be in academia? \n\nThe project is, if you\u2019ve got good supervisors, solvable. You can decide what to do within the limits of the project description, which if it\u2019s as terrible as you say, is probably so vague you will have plenty of scope to change.

To be honest, it\u2019s a rare academic that takes much notice of what the original proposal said they would do\u2026..\n\nNot wanting to be in academia is not a great reason to quit in and of itself. My PhD was fascinating and rewarding but I had no intention of going into academia. It also gave me easy access to many jobs I did want to do - PhDs are still quite rare and so still a valuable commodity when getting jobs. You should be learning useful skills (e.g. data analysis and problem solving, as well as R/Python etc), which are again very marketable.

Write a good (as in, useful to my scientific community) thesis and b.) Make myself competitive for the post-doc job market?\n\n1. At the simplest, most basic level to answer your question: is there a gap in the literature that is missing  or questions that are left unanswered that your dissertation/research intends to fill or answer? If so, this seems like a good dissertation topic to choose and research. \n2. \"Good\" is going to be viewed completely **subjectively** by every reader of your post. Regardless of whatever topic you choose within your field to write your dissertation on, there will be some professors, researchers, and doctoral students who view your topic with interest and others who don't. You can't please everybody. \n3. I do not want to take what you said in your post out of context and if you were not implying this, I apologize. However, I want to stress that one's usefulness to a field should not be the only criteria for assessing a dissertation as either \"good\" or \"bad.\" Again, \"good\" or \"bad\" its subjective. Furthermore, since this dissertation is \"your baby\" and something you commit years to (putting your blood, sweat, and tears into), should you not get any enjoyment out of writing it as well and choose a topic that is of general interest to you? The way I read your post, it came off as asking what you could do to write a dissertation that was considered \"good\" to others in terms of benefit to the field, while \"personal enjoyment\" and \"interest\" took a secondary or back seat in terms of importance. \n4. Whether it's a post doc or job interview, it's up to you to **sell your dissertation and research interests/topic.** You can certainly opt for a dissertation topic that is quote unquote \"flavor of the month\" or currently being discussed heavily in publications, conferences, or academics within your field. However, I don't think you should be deterred or off put by choosing a dissertation topic that you are passionate about or have significant interest in just because it's not heavily talked or written about in publications. Furthermore, in a lot of job interviews, your dissertation topic doesn't simply speak for itself. Hiring committees or professors at institutions will ask you about your research interests (this includes your dissertation topic) and ask how it is relevant to: (**A**) your specific field, (**B**) the institution you are applying to and how it can benefit the institution (in regards to your teaching, students you teach, professors/co-workers, the university as a whole) (for a job or post doc), (**C**) your future directions for research, which may align with the research you intend to do during your post doc. \n5. If you're looking for advice, choose a dissertation topic that you are passionate about and have general interest in. This is because with all the research you will do into this topic (literature review, general research study), you'll hopefully have a steady base within a discipline area that you are familiar with in terms of the general history, major researchers/authors within this field, major pieces of work/publications, and major points of contention/discussion/issues within this discipline area. With this base of knowledge, even if you branch out to inter-disciplinary work or research that deviates slightly from your original dissertation topic, this \"base of knowledge\" will always be handy. This is in contrast to choosing a dissertation topic that you perhaps never were fully passionate about or interested in, but it was quote unquote \"useful to the scientific community\" or you chose it because it was a hot talking point within your field at the time, but by the end of your dissertation, you quickly grew tired of it and in subsequent years, you chose to dive into other fields of research/study. This is completely fine, as I, myself have several areas of interest in terms of research. However, my point is, it would be a waste to do all this research in a particular area or discipline for your dissertation only for it to go to waste in a few years and in your case, never using the knowledge you gained from your dissertation in the research you do in a post doc because you quickly grew tired of that area of research. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ugiu0q/what_maximizes_utility_of_a_phd_thesis/i71c1yv/"}, "262": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PaperProfessional731", "Date": 1651504823, "Score": 3, "Body": "Good advice!

To end as I began, I will mention the importance of rest again during the PhD. We understand going into the PhD that it will be hard work, but it shouldn't require all-nighters and working weekends.

Block out working hours. During that time either work or do nothing (no browsing, no eating, no other activities -- except bathroom and hydration, of course). I find that I would rather work than do nothing and be bored. This technique pairs well with having some non-work related thing to look forward to after the working block.\n2. Focus on the fun part of the work. I find that sometimes the cause of my procrastination is my expectation of the result (will I like it? will it be good? correct? ughhhh the anxiety, you know). Shifting focus to enjoying the work instead of the possibility of enjoying the result makes me less likely to push off work.\n3. I don't know if I can explain this part well but sometimes realizing that nothing matters that much can free you to do whatever you want. Sometimes my procrastination is a procrastination on making decisions (which variables to look at first, which words, which direction, which analysis, who to email, should I email, what to ask, etc), so making yourself feel free and optimistic can reduce the tendencies to procrastinate on making decisions.\n4. Take, like, 5 days off every once in awhile. Just tell people, protect those 5 days, and really do no work.\n5. I don't do this often but: thinking about work as an opportunity to train yourself rather than an opportunity for you to show (yourself or your circle) what you can do. Every work session is a training in disciplining/opening/strengthening/honing your mind and thoughts. So again the result doesn't matter because what matter is the training process.

If your specific field has skills that would be useful (e.g. learning python), it might be useful to dedicate a few hours a week to those. However, I recommend resting and taking some time off if you have the opportunity. I took a month off before and I'm SO HAPPY I did. \n\nHere's my take on managing a PhD:\n\n1. **The word \"no\" is your best friend.**  Learn to attenuate your own workload. When I TA, I tell my students in advance (and multiple times throughout the quarter) that I do not respond to messages outside of working hours. I am not paid enough to be  on call. In my advisor meetings, the word \"no\" looks like \"I have five things on my list, but I only have the capacity to do three this week. Which three are the highest priority?\" or \"that timeline / deadline is unrealistic - the work would not be high quality\"\n2. **Don't try to do everything.** Learn which pieces are important. As a PhD student, my grades do not matter. When I take classes, I figure out how many points I need to comfortably pass the class and shoot for that. I plan out which of the assignments I'm not going to do or which points are not worth my time. Learn what things are going to have the biggest long-term impact (both on your degree and beyond) and focus your time and energy on those pieces. You're going to be asked to do a lot of extraneous stuff during your degree. Learn what is important; see point 1 for the things that are unimportant.\n3. **Get organized.** I have so many things to say about this, and it's way too long to write here, so I'm [linking to one of my previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/qihqfr/comment/hik1u0t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n4. **Find a schedule that works for you. Stick to it.**  I stick strongly to a 'normal working hours' schedule. I track how much time I work in a spreadsheet. When I've put in my hours for the day or week, I stop working. Very little of what we do is actually time critical. The work will be there tomorrow. That next email or report can be sent in the morning.\n5. **Ask for help.** A PhD cannot be done alone. Asking for help can mean asking for advice,help brainstorming, resources, etc. Note that this is active - the resources and help are there, but they won't come to you. Get to know your advisor, your cohort, your elder grad students. Ask for help, lenience, or guidance if you're struggling.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ugrb1j/im_starting_my_phd_in_the_fall_i_would_appreciate/i72yhy3/"}, "330": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "popegonzalo", "Date": 1651528428, "Score": 3, "Body": "its a mood dependent thing. what you need is enough non-work time for you to think. working too much harms your PhD.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ugv7z1/zero_procrastination/i72yojt/"}, "331": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1651528483, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

Setting healthy habits helps prevent burnout. \n\nI would try reduce course load if possible. 1-2 courses a semester should be plenty to get you the required amount of credits. \n\nAs for research - there is no boundary on how much work you can put in per week. But, I would recommend setting limits. And keeping aside time for personal life, and relaxation. My personal observation is that I'm more productive if I'm relaxed and refreshed. This in turn means that I don't have to put in as many hours for the same outcome. And that means I have more spare time to relax. It sounds like you are in a grind cycle that you need to break out of. I'd start with sleep and food. Make sure you get enough sleep and nourishment. Even if it means less work gets done. The dividends will come soon enough. Nothing kills productivity like a tired mind. \n\nAlso, it's okay to take breaks, especially if you are stuck on something or not making progress. More grind doesn't always mean more output, sometimes the break resets your chain of thought and allows you to go in fresh directions. \n\nDon't compare your progress with others. Everyone has their own timelines. The comparison only create more stress and makes you work longer, but does not necessarily improve the outcomes. \n\nHaving friends and a social circle is important too. You could even start with some clubs or organized groups. Time spend socializing/doing something you like isn't time wasted.\n\nThere is no one solution that fits all. Find what works best for you. I worked longer hours on weekdays, but kept weekends work free for the most part. \n\nBottomline is that self care is important. Burnout is real. Things take time, dont push too hard.

To answer your question directly; it will be difficult, but that doesn\u2019t make it impossible. A good undergraduate degree is the minimum requirement for a PhD. The \u201cproblem\u201d is that you will be competing against many others with a first or masters. To increase your chances, how much are you willing to compromise? This is in two areas. First location, are you willing to move? Second is topic area. Do you have a fixed idea of what you want to do or are you happy to look at any area of maths? What about statistics? Even areas of engineering, computing etc? The more you are willing to compromise, the more programs available, so the higher your chances of getting in.\n\nI would also reiterate many of the comments here about funding. Please, please, please try for funding, even if that means compromising more. Most funded STEM PhDs in the UK are advertised, so start looking through these. The PhD is hard enough anyway without financial concerns. Another reason is more subtle, but when you graduate with a PhD how do you expect to get funding for a postdoc (usually at least twice the value) when you can\u2019t get funded for the PhD? \n\nAlso, do you have a \u201cbackup plan\u201d if you don\u2019t like academia? Many people have an idea of academia but the reality is often very different. Not saying that is the case for you, but it\u2019s worth having something in mind if you get 1 or 2 years in and realise academia isn\u2019t for you. Even if you do like it, getting postdocs and academic jobs is again highly competitive.\n\nI know much of this doesn\u2019t really answer your question about having a masters. The real answer is \"it depends\", you can get in programs directly from undergraduate, but having a master's bolsters your CV and puts you higher on the pecking order. \n\nIf you have any questions fire away, but if not best of luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ugxpvx/doing_maths_phd_without_masters_maths_uk/i75bdj6/"}, "462": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lifestressgoaway", "Date": 1651577969, "Score": 8, "Body": "Yes the fear is pressing \u2018submit\u2019 is so bad.

I first want to say that one of my professors during coursework really put it in perspective as to what a dissertation/thesis should be versus sometimes what a doctoral/Master's student expects this piece of writing to be. She stated that her initial expectation of a dissertation (could be thesis too) was a \"solar system\" and when she finally finished her dissertation, it ended up being a planet or meteor within that solar system. Point being is that to pick a dissertation or research topic, you should start **big** in terms of research field/topic and then narrow it down (make it **small**) to a specific, niche research focus. Individuals saying that your ideas are too descriptive may be actually incorrect. To me, the more focused your topic and research questions are, the more beneficial it will be for you down the line when your conducting your research study and determining your data collection methods and data analysis approaches of your data.\n2. If you need inspiration, a general idea of the topics you could cover for your dissertation, or studies that you could expand upon, look at recent articles published within prominent peer-reviewed academic journals within your field. These are usually the hot topics or most up to date topics being discussed within your field. It may generate some ideas. You also get an idea of the general swath or wide array of topics and possibilities ut there in which you could write a research paper about.\n3. One thing that opened my mind up to the possibilities of what I could write about for a final research paper for a course or potential dissertation topic was scheduling a meeting with a professor that I trust within my field. We would sit in their office for 30-minutes and we'd talk about some of my interests and my professor would rattle of some directions I could go with the topic at hand. In a lot of cases, I was very naive to the possibilities and potential of a research topic in terms of the direction I could with it. Furthermore, these are individuals that have been in the field for years/decades, know the current literature within your field, and are a resource of knowledge. Take advantage of their knowledge and help.\n4. Don't be afraid to think outside the box or go the road less traveled when choosing a dissertation or research topic. At the end of the day, if you find merit in researching the topic and it generally excites you, I say go for it. Who cares what other people think. I'm getting my doctorate degree in Composition and Applied Linguistics, basically I want to be a postsecondary English teacher. While there is nothing wrong with picking a \"safe\" or \"common\" topic, choosing topics related to multilingual learners, teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), or first-year writing can sometimes be boring or bland because they've been talked and written about to death. At times during my doctoral journey, I've chosen topics for final research papers or a dissertation topic that merged my love of English/composition with another hobby of mine. For example: (**1**) the impact of incorporating English words within Japanese song lyrics has on Japanese hip hop artists identity construction (Japanese hip hop, identity construction, English), (**2**) fragrance consumers' perception of perfume with non-english names (perfume, transnationalism, sociolinguistics), (**3**) social class-dividing language use within niche and designer fragrance debate (perfume, sociolinguistics), and (**4**) the knowledge, experience, beliefs, and type of training that community college writing teachers would want to better accommodate students with learning disabilities (first-year writing, community colleges, disability studies). I'm assuming you're a marketing major based on your user name. Reflect on some of your current hobbies and see how you can incorporate that into a potential research paper. See what literature is out there and find a potential gap.\n\nGood luck OP.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/ugx2at/1st_year_phd_idea_generation/i75lmnz/"}, "494": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Zealousideal-Load269", "Date": 1651583545, "Score": 1, "Body": "A lot of unis when you apply for a PhD, at least from what I\u2019ve seen, then automatically consider you for funding - fees and stipend - and this is without an already advertised funded PhD.

But please remember that this is specific to my case (my field, my country, my advisor, etc). YMMV.\n\nI used to work part-time (gig) since my Bachelors. I would do ghost writing or video transcriptions. I did the same during my PhD. This was never steady as my PhD workload was hella inconsistent. \n\nAlso I wasn't working at all in the first and final years of my PhD. During the first year, I was busy setting up analysis pipelines and automating stuffs. During my final year (last year), I was too busy with writing papers and my thesis.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. My PhD wasn't lab based. It was mostly computational and once you somewhat automate it, you save considerable time.\n\n2. My boss was super cool. She knew that I was working part-time. She never complained as long as I was doing my PhD work on time.\n\n3. There is no explicit law in my country that forbid (or limit) students from working.\n\n4. The pandemic hit and we were working from home. So I could do the gig alongside my PhD tasks.\n\n5. I could automate away some of the gig work as well. By using TTS softwares. \n\nWhat didn't work:\n\n1. I felt severely burnt out at times. Looking back, it should have been obvious.\n\n2. Since there are effectively double the commitments, I missed out on many. I feel like I could have made many more important connections, with people in my field, had I not taken up the gigs.\n\n3. I did not pursue many \"side-projects\" during my PhD because of this. This could be a good or a bad thing depending on who you ask. But it could have led to a better PhD.\n\nIn conclusion, do I think it was worth it? Well, no. Surely it led to a **slightly** better quality-of-life, but it did not help me in my career. \n\nMy advice, if you want a career in academia, stop worrying about part-time jobs and focus on your PhD.\n\nIf you are not certain about your future in academia, maybe consider jobs that can supplement your resum\u00e9 (like programming, project management etc).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uhty2w/full_time_stem_phd_while_working_part_time/i79poyr/"}, "703": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Krumplin2", "Date": 1651654619, "Score": 6, "Body": "The academic journal industry", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uhopfq/what_is_the_most_toxic_aspect_of_academia/i79qtry/"}, "704": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Anti-ThisBot-IB", "Date": 1651654687, "Score": 1, "Body": "Hey there gogobuddycool!

I came close to failing out of a poorly ranked state school and managed to graduate with a 2.7 GPA. There were a lot of personal factors. I never wanted to be anything except a scientist though.\n\nI got my first job in research testing sunscreens and deodorants for a personal healthcare company (I had to apply twice over an 8 month period before I even got the interview, before that I was working tele-sales). I excelled and was transferred within the same company to the transdermal pharmaceutical product testing. I used that new experience in clinical trials to get a job in a dermatology clinic as a research coordinator. Then used that experience to get a job in a psychiatry practice. Then used that experience to get a job at a major university in their neurology department. Then took a year off to do field work in my original field (I found a sympathetic PI looking for volunteer field assistants and saved up for two years to afford the expense). When I returned to the work world I had 6 years of clinical research experience and I was willing to take a position I was over qualified for just to get in the door. I ended up in the neuroscience department at Columbia. They had free tuition for employees so I finessed my way into a master's program. \n\nAfter 10 years I was finally accepted into a fully-funded PhD program at one of the top schools in my discipline. \n\nAll this to say, if there is a will there is a way. It will not be easy, will likely take a bit of sacrifice and humility, but if you want it - you can figure it out. What helped for me was comparing myself to the ideal PhD applicant for the program and then honestly evaluating all of the places where I fell short. From there I could make a game plan to address each shortcoming. Because my GPA was below the 3.0 cut-off for instance, I knew I would get tossed by the first filter I encountered. So while I was working on building research experience, I was also taking undergrad classes at whatever community college was local, such that by the time I was ready to apply I had accumulated enough credits to pull my total weighted GPA up above that 3.0 threshold. My ability to work my way into an academic research position also meant that I had excellent references (who had been my supervisors for years) and had worked on teams that had published several articles. \n\nIf it's what you want to do - just do it.

My comment is US-centric and may not apply if you are not in the US. In the US, the therapist must be licensed in the state you are in, even if you do telehealth, so someone would need to know your location AND happen to have a solid recommendation in your state to recommend a specific therapist. \n\nSome options to consider:\n\n1. Your university counseling center is likely free or close to free (given that your fees have already paid for their service). However, even if that is a bad fit for an actual provider, they are likely to have referral specialists who know who is open and taking various insurance options. In some areas, therapists will reserve some slots for college students referred out, so you can sometimes get in more quickly than if you do it on your own. \n2. If you are insured, your insurance company can let you know who is paneled and give you some folks to contact. You can literally just call the number on the back of your insurance card. \n3. If you have a graduate student union or just good advocacy from students, there may be a list of providers who are recommended by other students (who, if you are insured through your school, probably take your insurance). My program has a list of healthcare providers including therapists who other students have had a good experience with and my graduate student union facebook page often discusses recommendations for providers including therapists. \n4. If your university has a relevant mental health graduate training program, they may provide very-low-cost therapy through in-house clinics. \n5.

From my experience entry requirements for a PhD position only include a masters degree (or similar) and a good GPA always helps. I haven't published a research article before I started and I don't think its necessary to get a position.\n\nIn Germany all positions at public research institutes need to be properly advertised. Check out the websites of the institutes/unis for open positions. In Hamburg, where I work, you should check out all these new institutes that opened on the DESY campus (Harbor, CSSB, EMBL) - especially with your physics background. They do a lot of biophysics there. I do my PhD at the physical chemistry department of the uni hamburg and we have a big focus on nanoparticles as well - some of which are interesting for cancer research. If you would like a more medical setting, check out the university hospitals (UKE in Hamburg).\n\nSomething always worth doing is getting in contact with specific groups that do interesting research. Sometimes group leaders can already tell you that there will be a new position opening soon. Even better: approach them with a plan of what specifically you would like to study that would fit into their group. Maybe they will look for funding and create a new position for you then.\n\nOther than that, you'll just need to apply, apply, apply. The application process itself is not different from any other job: You usually just send your CV, transcript of records and a letter of motivation via email to the address specified in the advertisement and if you are considered for the position, you'll be invited for an interview and sometimes give a talk about your research during the masters.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uimvdg/need_advice_on_taking_phd_in_nanotechnology/i7ejk64/"}, "958": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "americantart", "Date": 1651740942, "Score": 1, "Body": "The funding I got was from the entire Doctorate School at my uni- so all faculties were competing for it.

You would need to think what you want for you future, and then see what alternative will be more helpful, add more value. \n\nChoosing a job is not only about the money, although the much lower income of a PhD student compared to a data scientist often becomes a source of frustration. Just like you are wondering if you are making a mistake now, lots of PhD student start to think they made a mistake when they could be getting much more money. \n\nChoosing a job is often also choosing several other things. It's choosing a much certain future, as you are better able to know how much money you are going to make, where you are going to live, and things like that. Which often affect plans to buy a car or a house, plans to make friends, plans to marry, etc. It's choosing real like experience. It's choosing getting quick results, as a PhD is much slower in pace. It's choosing a wider range of knowledge and skills, as PhDs are usually very narrow, focused. It's choosing to network with different people. \n\nSure, a PhD can level up your profile.

Both my advisor and I by the time I was graduating were really disappointed in each other, and had \"weekly activity report\" WAR meetings. His response to my putting in less insane hours was more meetings.\n\nBut they signed off on my dissertation. My PhD is from their lab. I thanked them in my acknowledgements, and shook their hand with a \"thank you\" during our last in-face meeting before I moved away to my post-doc. They wrote me a fair letter of recommendation that got me jobs.\n\nI've had PI's from other labs take me out for beer or coffee to talk me down from arguments with my PI. I was their biggest challenger in the lab, rarely on scientific rigor, but on *how we were doing the science*. \n\nI graduated. Moved across the country. Switched fields. The weirdest shit happened in my second year of postdoc. I opened my mouth and my PI's scientific arguments came out of my mouth. I legitimately was shaken up. After the time away, I realized that PhD's are like apprenticeships, and I trained under a Master. Lots of fucked up connotations there. PIs aren't trained how to be PIs, and often bring a lot of their own baggage to how they manage their labs.

I'm part of a scientific legacy.\n\nI'm eternally grateful for the opportunity to perform my graduate studies in that lab. That department. Much of my training was from other PIs, facility directors, other graduate students and postdocs... But they were the PI that signed off on my PhD.

My best advice is to **create a set night time routine and stick to it** as well as you can. Our bodies like routine. They like having a rhythm. When you have no set routine or rhythm it's hard for our bodies to know what to expect and act accordingly. Every single night do this:\n\n1. Step away from work at least 1 hour before you want to go to sleep. Ideally longer. And pick roughly the same time every night.\n2. Spend some time doing something you enjoy but which is relaxing and allows your brain and body to unwind and slow down in preparation for sleep. E.g. read some fiction, take a bath, watch a light-hearted show (best to avoid screens but sometimes the trade off is worth it if the activity genuinely helps you to unwind).\n3. Consider dimming lights in your house/room(s) as it helps to signal to your body that it is the evening and you're preparing for sleep. If you find certain music, sounds, candles etc. relaxing, use them. When we struggle to sleep it's not just because our brain won't shut off, it's usually also because we're holding tension in out body. For example, most of us have tension in our shoulders all day every day. Relax your shoulders right now. Let them drop. You don't realise how much tension is in your body every single day, but tension will stop your body from feeling prepared for sleep. Do what ever you can to relax your whole body.\n4. Create a few little rituals right before you go to sleep - these act as signals that it's time to settle down. Drink a herbal tea, brush your teeth, wash your face, whatever. Just little things that you do in the same order every night.\n5. Go to bed. If you're still struggling, utilise mindfulness techniques to stop your mind wandering back onto the topic of work and/or try progressive muscle relaxation. Don't pick up your phone, no matter how long you feel you've been lying there. Stay away from screens at all costs.\n6. Finally, wake up the same time every morning.\n\nStick to a set routine every night and after a few weeks you'll notice a big difference. It's not an immediate fix, you have to give it time. It's the building of the routine that matters and that takes a little time. You need to train your brain and body to know when it's time to slow down. If you really need an extra helping hand, try using natural sleep aids like valerian root. I use both the tea and the tablets every now and then.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ujv6f7/how_do_you_shut_your_brain_off_at_night/i7lp8bp/"}, "1393": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "phililisaveslives", "Date": 1651872308, "Score": 3, "Body": "Heyo!

I think that the American PhD monorail is problematic because it helps to *keep* American academia insulated as @tzssao describes. \n\nOften, again in my field at least, doing a PhD in America is tied with the responsibilities of being a TA for the university you attend, and your lack of an advanced degree and the fact your (often egregiously large amount of) tuition is remissed is a reasonable justification for the University to a. Keep you there as long as possible and b. pay you less than other people that it hires to do the same job (not that they're paid premium wages either, but that's another thing altogether). By contrast, many of the European programs I was looking into when I applied to grad school offered very very small (in comparison) rates without added TA responsibilities. \n\nI think both these factors combine into the quagmire/limbo that people often get stuck in while trying to finish their degree: the end of the degree is very hard to see from where you're at, ta responsibilities take up a lot of time so you feel like you're not making nearly as much progress as you \"should,\" and the fact that PHD programs don't require advanced training makes it so that a lot of people with insufficient backgrounds can get into a PhD program and then have to take a step back in order to train the proper amount to enter their field.

But I'm 49 years old, in my last year of a 5-years PhD. And I'm not the oldest one in my school. \n\nAt least in my experience, age by itself is much less of a factor than people think. I certainly don't feel like the program was \"designed for 25 yos\" as you stated. A lot of things are designed case by case, like coursework and research projects, according to the specific conditions of each student, together with the advisor. \n\nAge by itself is rarely a factor in my opinion. But other factors associated with age, like experience, may be more relevant. And then it depends on how you play your cards. \n\nI see a lot of applicants with experience assuming that their experience will be automatically helpful for their PhDs. For example, they did research in industry and use that as argument to do research in academia. The problem is that this is often associated with a lack of understanding between the differences between research in industry and academia. So, although experience is a good thing, the lack of understanding about what a PhD is or what academic research is becomes a problem. Many older applicants are stubborn and are not willing to let go of what they did before, not being open to the changes that academia requires. It's like they want to do a PhD but they don't want to do what is expected during a PhD. \n\nOlder students also tend to be rustier in terms of undergrad knowledge. For example, I had a hard time dealing with matrices because last time I did any calculation with matrices was decades ago. \n\nSome older applicants can also have trouble, specially during the application but also later, explaining or understanding the role of a PhD in their career and life. For example, why did the person wait so long to do a PhD? It's harder to convince programs that you are passionate about research when you waited so long to start. You should have a good answer for that, for applications and for yourself. Another example is the financial impact. If you are successful as a consultant, for example, the program may think they are not doing anyone any favor by taking you as a PhD student. Giving up on success, high income, less risk and uncertainties requires some good explanation too. \n\nBut remember that it's not all about challenges. Older people also tend to have advantages related to their maturity.

I work on a computational bio method development which I was warned by my advisor would take me at least four years to make. He didn't have funding for the project back then. He was the nicest mentor of all and I was genuinely interested in the problem. However, I was told to shadow my senior grad student as she was leaving the lab after graduation so that I can continue her project till I get the funding. Funding didn't reach for the next 8 months and I could see that the project I took over is promising but might not end up in a publication as the collaborators are lagging on their parts despite my advisor asking them to work on it. Now I have to face my qualifier with this project with no future or with a project that has no funding. I started prepping for the qual. A week before my qual, the funding for the original project got granted. But it was too late for me to work on it so I stick with the project that had no future as I was working on it for the past 8 months and I was more familiar with the problem at hand. To make it worse, my qual committee consider a thesis committee of my senior who already knew this project had no future as my senior did the bulk of the project, and what I proposed is subject to the publication of the current results. So the committee rejected the proposal as it was solely based on the previous work that wasn't published yet and my proposal wasn't moving the field and a waste of effort, if the computational prediction which we made didn't come up true. As I was relying upon a hypothesis to build my proposal, my strategy was inherently flawed, since it was solely based on the success of the hypothesis which was unknown at the time. TLDR I failed my qual. The rest of my grad cohert passed the qual. This was a final blow to the project and both my advisor and I decided to dig this project a grave and move forward with the original project I signed up for. A little context, I come from physics and the original project was more physics-related while the project I worked on for 8 months was hardcore molecular bio sims. \n\nNow I'm starting a new project from scratch after 2 years into my Ph.D. without a candidacy, and the committee asked me to reappear in six months for an exam and another failure was a ticket back home. I worked my ass off to build the protocol, COVID hit full swing, I was depressed as fuck while my roommate who was a junior of mine would occasionally boast the publication he made to make it worst. I kind of deflected most of the sarcasm and empathy by self burns and how I improving as a researcher blah...blah! But internally, it was screaming. There were not so many friends I had back then and offloading this stress was difficult. I suffered a lot. However, we got promising results and I appeared for the qual this time, I passed with flying color a and the committee was impressed! \n\nHowever, this happiness was short-lived, the simulations which initially showed promising results now started with no signs of convergence. We did a ton of troubleshooting. Nothing changed. 4 months went by just like that. My advisor told me he has no clue what was going on. I took this personally and tried all the methods I can, not to toot my horn, but after ~ 25 strategies on clicked. This strategy implementation took 6 months. Now I'm in my 4th year, with no publication yet. After the promising preliminary result, we started the full data churning mode for publication which is ongoing. This gave me enough time, to take a break and go for an industry internship, right now, I'm hitting my 5th-year mark and the data has been churning for the last 5 months and the initial analysis looks all good and I hope that this would result in the publication. My very first publication. My advisor during the last one-on-one meeting told me, it's sad that I might not see the fruits of the method I developed as I might graduate before the mature. I laid out the ground and future grad students would benefit from them. \n\nI presented all the failed methods that I tried at a conference and the people I met over there asked me to publish this negative data as it is more relevant than the anticipated results. \n\nI'm glad that I moved the boundary of science at least an inch though most of it was negative data. Looking past the last 4 years, all the events that I thought as failures turn out to be in favor. I can make another long rant about that as well. I'm happy now. I may not be as successful as my peers. But I'm glad that I tried. \n\n\nAnd for your extraction issue, one of my friends was saying something similar which happened to an invited speaker while this person was a grad student. They tried to purify DNA from a sample, for 6 months with no luck. Then this random person gave her the idea that she might be extracting DNA from a purified protein sample. She checked the sample and there was a mishap from the lab manager. She said she would have left grad school in a month or so due to self-doubt. But now she is a leading academic faculty. \nI hope you might tell something similar in the next 10 years. \nPeace.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/ujnunv/please_help_feeling_hopeless/i7rpzfz/"}, "1569": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "pineapple-scientist", "Date": 1651991993, "Score": 3, "Body": "I am in a similar boat in my PhD and have found connecting with alums from my program in industry helpful. Especially considering your #2, you should talk to people and look at job positions. I think you would look for job titles like \"research scientist\" if you wanted to continue doing bench work. So many biotech&amp;pharma companies (e.g., Genentech,  Takeda, Johnson&amp;Johnson) have benchwork positions that will involve project design, experiments, mentoring, presenting, analyzing data.... Everything except teaching classes. That being said, I know people who work in industry and teach a course at a university part-time, so it's possible. If you look at a large company, they may have flexibility in where you work so #5 may be an option.\n\nYou may also be interested in places like NIH, FDA, MIT Lincoln Labs, the Broad... All are  research centers that mimic the structure and functioning of academic labs.\n\nFor 1) yes industry pays more, but it depends a lot on type of industry. I get paid ~$35k/year as a PhD student. I hear as a postdoc in academia is ~$55k/year. You can also do a postdoc in industry which I hear starts at ~$65k. A full-time position in industry can have a large range depending on what company/organization. FDA/government has set rates, biotech/pharma tends to start PhD's at atleast ~$100k and tech companies will start atleast ~$140k. All this is negotiable though and will depend on your specifics. I am basing this off of the east coast, USA. I have no idea what startups usually offer but would be interested to find out.\n\n3 and 4) I think for most companies will be about equal morally as academia. Both have a pressure to publish/produce. That being said, I like that the people I've talked to in large biotech/pharma companies actually have boundaries around working, sick, and vacation hours that are respected. And people understand having  kids/family more at these companies than academia. It's not something looked at as a career hurdle.\n\nYou should definitely talk to more people in industry though. You can always try working in industry for a couple years then decide whether you want to come back to apply for a postdoc or faculty position in academia. My impression from talking to people doing postdocs is that it can be incredibly helpful IF you have a strong sense of what you want to do with it and you find the right lab to do it. And ofcourse do a post doc if you know you definitely want to be a professor.\n\n So many people have told me not to just do a post doc because I'm undecided - so that is my advice for you. I think it used to be seen as taboo to go into industry and then back to academia, but now even my professors say it's really ok. You can still gain valuable experiences. And I know people who went to industry who publish more in big journal than they did during their PhD.

Overall it's hard to get. And you cannot do a PhD without fundings. \n\n\\- in France once you enter a PhD program, you are considered to be in-between a worker and a student. The government acknowledge you as working full time and thus you also get money take off your paycheck every month for your future retirement while also keeping the status of student. But being consider as a worker mean you have the right of a 5 weeks paid vacations days and you are protected by labor laws.\n\n\\- In France, in science at least, a PhD last 3 years. It's not uncommon to get a one year extension, so at most you will do 4 years. It's exceptionnally rare to go above 4 years and it's usually because something happened to you like a major health issue or something. It's also very rare to not get your PhD. Once you enter the PhD program, you are pretty much sure that in 3-4 years you will get a PhD, you will not \"master out\" of the program, you might get a very meh PhD but you will get it. Some students do abandon but usually within the first six months, I don't want to say it never happens but It's extremely unliquely and rare that someone would drop out after like 2 years or finish the program without their diploma. \n\n\\- Not a lot of people keep on academia, and there are a lot of programs developing in universities now to valuate your CV and PhD skills for the industry, during your PhD you also have **free formations** you can do like \"how to manage a project\" or \"PhD and industry\" in order to get contacts and for you to find how to opt out of academia and land on your feet.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ukf0mj/newbie_question_why_does_it_seem_that_doing_a_phd/i7taaq0/"}, "1620": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MonkeyParadiso", "Date": 1652029124, "Score": 1, "Body": "Political situation may have improved; I'll take a look again, thx", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ukh7r5/should_i_consider_a_noneconventional_phd_at_43/i7te210/"}, "1621": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MonkeyParadiso", "Date": 1652029431, "Score": 1, "Body": "Don Norman told me that when I was looking at Design PhD at UCSD.

See if there is a shortcut to know what the paper is about (e.g., in a quantitative paper, if you know the data and the model, you probably know almost everything that you need to know, most of the rest you can infer from that)\n\n\\- See if there is a software, procedure, code, package that someone developed to make your work faster (and less prone to human error). \n\n\\- I lost count of the times I had to write a paper over and over again. Now, before I start writing a new version of a paper, I create the structure of the paper, what are the parts of the paper, with a short description of what I'm going to include in each part and the reasoning. Then I validate this structure with my advisor. It's much easier and faster to write a new version of the structure than a new version of the paper. This saved me a lot of time.

My mental health was not good before, and now it's not better nor worse -- it's just different.\n\nThere was a learning process in my pre-phd mental health journey as well so I've been applying what I've learned, and I think I'm coping better than people who haven't been through some tough challenges before.

It also might be that you already learned a lot about yourself and how to take care of your mental health, and the program is just another challenge.\n\nThat being said, I think the main deciding factor for me was that I was sure of the general (although foggy at the time) direction I want to explore academically and I was sure that I hated my job, which is different in your case.

It would help most if going for public policy or a managerial position but then again you won't likely be a manager if you're just starting out (but \"won't likely\" does not mean \"won't\").\n2. Different strokes for different folks. \"Industry\" is a vague term so it depends on so many factors. Are you going to be the head of a research program? I'd say yes it matters. Are you going to be a benchtop worker doing experiments? I'd say it doesn't matter nearly as much as having the skill sets. Are you going to be a scientific writer? I'd say your ability could be assessed by reading your work regardless of which journal it's in (i.e., poor writing in a prestigious journal is not as beneficial as good writing in a less prestigious journal).\n3. No, you don't have to do a postdoc to justify your PhD. Postdoc can be in industry by the way. But an academic postdoc would be a waste of your time and signify bad decision-making skills. If you were a hiring manager and you heard someone say \"I knew I didn't want to be in academics but applied to academic positions\", what would you think about that person? You would just be delaying your advancement by waiting another year or 2 or 3 or 4 when you could be getting experience in the workforce.\n4. If you're applying for a writing position I'd say sort of (good writing is necessary but not sufficient to get funded). If you're applying to start a research program at a company I'd say yes. If you're going into sales I'd say maybe (persuasive skills). If you're going to just do benchtop work I'd say no. If you're going into public policy I'd say no. Just pretend you're the hiring manager.\n5. You may have answered your own question. If you think it's wasteful then your heart won't be in it. This usually means you'll fail.\n6.

The underlying point I was getting at here is students who have been merely accepted into or have yet to complete their degree from said university have yet to add to the prestige of the university that comes from applying the quality education one received to achieve \"subjective success\" in the form of getting good grades, developing networks/relationships with important people within your field, being successful in your career (post-graduation), and living a successful life. In reality, these type of people are just riding the coattails or \"dick-riding\" (if you will) the success of thousands, if not millions of students that have come before them who have attended this institution and went on to achieve some level of success in life to build up the reputation of the institution to what it is today. Simply put, unless you've got a degree in hand, have actually applied the knowledge or experience you obtained from said postsecondary institution to your place of work, and have achieved some level of success in your work place/field, talking about \"prestige\" of your university doesn't really mean a damn thing (because you didn't add to it).\n2. I'm not saying this belief system applies to you OP, but I've seen many people who view life through a \"quantifiable\" lens. That is they only place value on what they can quantify such as: grades, GPA, test scores, prestige of a university, degree program, place of employment, position/rank within a place of employment, and yearly salary. However, factors that are more difficult to quantify are given secondary status when it comes to life importance such as personal happiness, self-independence, personal growth, and developing the skill of getting comfortable with being uncomfortable (aka. getting out of your comfort zone). Only you know whether you made the right decision to attend your current institution or not. Yet, factors such as location, and perhaps having a built in support system in friends/family close by while you attend your doctorate program I don't think was a bad decision and shouldn't be viewed in hindsight as a negative for not attending the other university. \n3. I think you should ask yourself what type of researcher, teacher, academic, or professional you want to be. Do you want to be \"**the carrier**,\" where you elevate the prestige and name of your alma mater and any postsecondary institution that you are employed at because of your own academic contributions within your field that you have established off of your own merit (publications, research, conference presentations, teaching ability) or do you want to simply be someone who was/is \"**riding in the car**\" or again, simply getting by off the name value of your alma mater or famous scholars/researchers whose courses you took during your doctorate program? Every field and program is different. In regards to me, as someone who is getting his doctorate degree in English composition and applied linguistics, when I look at some of the \"rock star\" scholars within my field, their alma mater, as well as the institutions they currently or previously worked at, they vary from big to small, prestigious to less prestigious universities. Famous scholars or researchers do not all come from quote unquote \"prestigious\" universities only. The institution I currently attend is pretty small and has a faltering reputation within my field. However, my professors are all top or respected scholars within their respective fields of English (rhetoric, transfer, identity). Sometimes, professors opt for smaller universities because of a variety of life factors: job opportunity timing (job pops up at just the right time), family, institution location, pay, course load, research opportunities, etc.  \n4. The message I have for you is pave your own lane at your current university and elevate the status of your institution when you graduate and get out into the workforce. Make prospective graduate students want to attend the current university you're teaching at or attend your alma mater because they know you went there/are teaching there and want to take your courses. \n5. The last thing I'll say is no good ever comes from comparing your degree of success in your field or doctoral program to that of others, even if they are your friends/peers. Life isn't a race and if you view life in that way, my question to you is what exactly are you competing for? What is the prize you win in this \"race of life\" for finishing in first place? Who cares if your peers are perhaps getting better opportunities than you at this current moment in time? If you consider them your friends and you care about them, you should be happy for them. Your time will come, it just may mean it may come later if compared to your peers or you may have to work a little harder to get it than them. But it doesn't mean those same opportunities are unobtainable to you. All I can say is I've been in my program for 6, going on 7-years now and the people who I personally saw that constantly compared themselves to others usually alienated themselves from cohort mates/friends because they caused unnecessary division/competition amongst the group, people quickly realized these individuals were cancerous/problematic, and they usually only looked out for themselves in regards to their own benefit (asking to look at your HW answers, only contacting you when they need something, and never willing to help out if it doesn't benefit them in some way, etc.). If people who I call my friends or peers are not happy for me when I succeed or see my success with jealous/hateful eyes, quite honestly, I don't want those type of people within my circle and I sure as hell, would never call those people\"peers,\" let alone \"friends.\" On the flip side, if you, yourself have envious or bitter notions toward peers or friends when they accomplish things in life, you seriously need to self-reflect and start identifying the root of the problem as to why you feel this way. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/umcrgy/possibly_regretting_my_choice_of_university/i83zuaa/"}, "2049": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1652222626, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

Worked(ing)  as a software engineer this last gap year because I was burnt out from school and wanted to explore what the other side was like.  \n\nI'm also agonizing about whether to go or to stay. Like you, getting into a PhD program was something I spent much effort and time to accomplish, so letting it go before even starting feels like I'm letting myself down, not to mention those that got me to that point in the first place. Like you, I developed mental health issues the last two years, mostly due to isolation and burnout, and am terrified at what grad school could do to make it even worse. And those \"wasting my potential\", \"settling for less\", \"unfulfilling job market\" feelings are 100% shared, whether or not they have any merit. \n\nI'll parrot some things friends and mentors have told me, as well as things I've noticed the past few years, in case it'll help you. \n\nWorking away from academia has it's perks.  More financial freedom and free time to cultivate yourself outside work is a big one, and honestly boring, unfulfilling work is a small price to pay for that. There will always be opportunity for intellectual stimulation outside of work. In my one year gap year experience in industry, I've found that the work is more structured, more rewarding (both financially and socially, if you have a good manager/coworkers) but not necessarily more fulfilling and freeing. There is something to be said of having that eureka moment in your research, as that's a high that I have only experienced in research, and not in industry. However, as I said, those moments can be found outside of work, just at a smaller personal scale, potentially.\n\nI think there a plenty of jobs that are intellectually demanding that don't need a PhD. Sure, maybe a PhD is required for the really interesting and bleeding edge ones, but you have an MA, you should be able to find something that isn't 100% grunt work no matter what field you're in. \n\nBut that said, I think it would help to not think of the PhD as a big commitment - just dip your toes in, see if you like the first year or so, and if you don't, master out and get a job! Just see it as hopping from one job to the next, since really, that's what it is. And if you end up liking grad school, great! And for the moving part, see it as an opportunity to explore a new land and meet cool new people, rather than seeing it as leaving everyone you know and love behind.\n\nIn situations like these, there really isn't a wrong decision. We all lament the road not taken, and to be honest, even for me I just know I'm gonna have regrets no matter the choice I make.

This will help you understand what sort of psychology degree you may want to pursue (clinical psych PhD, MSW, MFT, counseling psych PhD, etc etc). The best way to go about this is to get a full time job as a research assistant in a psychology lab that sounds interesting to you. If you\u2019re near a decent sized city, any college near you (not community) should have a psych department that has research going on. I suggest first googling the psych department of the school and searching through some of the labs. They will have blurbs about what they study and what populations they work with. From there you can decide what interests you, even if vaguely - do you want to work with kids? Have you always been interested in depression? Next I advise sending them an email asking if they have any openings in their lab for an RA position. Explain that you are motivated to learn what they do in their lab for xyz reasons and how your current work experience applies generally to RA work.\n\nGiven that you don\u2019t have any previous background in psych you may have to volunteer a few hours a week in a lab to get your feet wet before landing a full time RA gig. This unfortunately takes time and is somewhat competitive to get so don\u2019t be discouraged if this is what you want to do. Alternatively schools post open RA positions online but since you don\u2019t have any experience in psych you may have more luck personally reaching out.

A lot.\n\nDon't worry about what you're going to \"do with a PhD\". The reason is simple: the world's gone crazy. Some jobs require PhDs, others will think you're overqualified, yet others will promote you faster, others will not promote at all. If you were going to search for \"the most efficient way through the job market\", I'd have said: sure, think about what a PhD can do for you and if the return on investment is not a bit too crappy to be taken seriously.\n\nAt this point, PhD is either a question of pure necessity (e.g. career in academia, apparently not necessarily your goal), or pure personal taste and fulfillment, pride, joy etc. And I'd like to point out that the latter are good, perfectly valid and honorable reasons to pursue a PhD. You seem to actually fit right there.\n\nThe only thing that's holding you back is your mental problem... well, good one. Nothing is worth more than your health, so choose wisely. But also, consider this: I got severely burnt out (anxiety, severe insomnia, etc) during the first few months of my PhD, not owing to the PhD, but to my prior life. And not only did I finish my PhD, I actually graduated *magna cum* and essentially healed during those 5 years. But it took an unmistakable, nonnegotiable, all-in commitment to \"health first!\" on my side. This meant hitting the office around 10 am, 1-1.5 hours of lunch break, and on my way home by 3:30 pm. Never skipped even one single meal, watched my own boundaries like a tiger (\"No\" is the word I've learned best by now :-) I wouldn't have any of the \"but the grind!1!!\" BS), all this for 5 years straight.\n\nThe work was actually more efficient than when I had spent 8-10 hours in the office during my MS, overworked and underslept. However it took me 2 years just to write the dissertation at the end, as opposed to 6-12 months of my peers.\n\nBut different from my peers who looked like panda bears by the end (white face, black eyes) I actually could have gone on forever. It was fun :-) My PhD, especially the 2nd half of it, is actually one of my fondest memories of my \"grown up\" life, even now 10 years later.\n\nSo in the end: if you trust yourself to say \"no\" no matter the cost, go for it :-)\n\nThe social aspect, when dealing with mental stuff, is also important, but it's up to you to decide whether moving to a new location will work out for you (it did for me).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ummf5e/to_phd_or_not_to_phd/i87g8le/"}, "2194": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Potential_Audience27", "Date": 1652289003, "Score": 12, "Body": "I mean, there will be time off to compensate...

I love the enthusiasm. You can't publish a paper in a research journal on your own. You don't necessarily have to be associated with a university, but you do need to be a part of some sort of research group, institute, organization for any journal to peer review your work. But to answer your other questions: most journals accept papers at any time, the calls are just to encourage specific topics for the next issue. There are so many softwares that can be used in research - it really depends on the project. But for writing, lots of researchers use regular writing tools like Microsoft word and Google docs. For a lot of people, that's all they use - the writing process can be simple in that way. Some people also use LaTex to help with formatting for the journal. Citation managers like Mendeley and EndNote are also helpful. \n\nI agree with others who suggested looking for mentorship. It will help so much with figuring out what you want to do in your masters or PhD (btw, you do not need a master's to get a PhD, you do not need a PhD to do research).\n\nIf you want to start writing on your own, you can consider developing small projects to gain skills and documenting your progress and results over a blog. If you're looking for inspiration: In general, Nature, IEEE and Science are some of the biggest journals. I'm compbio, PLOS One and PLOS Compbio come to mind. Generally, I love the shorter news-style articles in Scientific American, Nature, and Science -- they're great for identifying topics of interest to you and specific researchers to read more from. Twitter can be good for this also. Don't pay for articles, many authors either post them to their lab &amp; personal websites (do some googling), the website researchgate, or they'll email it to you if you write a quick email.\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/un2lf9/writing_a_research_paper/i89oa5g/"}, "2267": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "exposedboner", "Date": 1652322379, "Score": 2, "Body": "I appreciate the people defending me, but it's fine.

One problem is, before we parted ways, I told her that I would like to apply for a PhD abroad right after graduation, but she told me she could not recommend me to do so because my skills are not of that PhD level, and she recommended me to apply to a company first and gain more experience or just apply PhD at our school. Another thing was, we actually planned to publish my thesis to an international journal, I gave her all things to review but she never had time to do it. She was busy with my other colleague's publication. Also, She actually introduced my colleague  to her previous colleague who was in a prestigious company abroad to be his referee for his PhD application abroad. She told me this without hesitation and telling me, he is really good that's why he is worth for recommendation.

Take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\n1. **Complain about it or do something about it**. When it comes to the degree of your writing skill, if you feel it is not up to par, you can always visit your university's writing center. I've told this story before on several other posts, but the first major writing assignment I had in one of my doctoral courses during my first semester (of my first year), it was literally bleeding red from all the mark ups. The professor who was also the writing center director suggested I use the writing center as a resource and after a semester of using the resource, my writing ability was a night and day difference. I could have just moped and complained about how my writing was inferior to that of my classmates, but instead, I actually took initiative and did something about it to minimize a self-determined weakness of mine. I think what really helped me was the tutors I worked with pointed out common writing errors that I made and \"crutch\" words that I tended to use a lot. This in turn, made me aware of many of the common errors I make/made in my writing and I began to self-correct my own errors by looking out for these mistakes and over time, I became a much-improved writer. I enjoyed the writing center so much that I have been working at my writing center as a tutor for 5.5 years now.\n2. **Suppress your ego**. I think one's ego can be a huge detriment to growth and seeking out help from others (classmates, professors, friends/family, writing center, university resources) when in a doctoral program. Sometimes you feel to much pride or as you have stated, you feel ashamed or inadequate to such a degree, that you start to question your own skills, knowledge, or intelligence. **News flash,** you are in a doctoral program for a reason: to develop your skills, learn, and expand your knowledge on areas related to your field of study. If you were already the finished product, my question to you is what would be the reason for spending thousands of dollars and 4-7 years of your life to be in a doctoral program? My advice to you is if you want to be successful and survive in a doctoral program, drop any resemblance of an ego you may have and be a sponge in that you soak up all the knowledge/information and advice you can from professors and cohort mates alike. They are a great resource.\n3. **No good comes from comparing one's doctoral (including dissertation) progress to that of your classmates**. I'm going to copy and paste what I have said in the past to comparing oneself to others within a doctoral program: I can tell you right now, there is never any good that comes from comparing yourself or your work to that of others, including your classmates or other students at various different points in your program. **Firstly**, at the doctoral level, you're expected to get an \"A\" grade. As long as your pass the course and your professor considers your work good enough to pass their course, who cares whether someone's writing ability, research ability, or vast knowledge in a respective subject is better than yours? **Secondly**, in a lot of instances, unless you ask or get to know them, you don't know people's educational or work-related background. I have a friend of mine in the same doctoral program as me, but came to the program 2-years after me (2 cohorts after me). Even though I was working on my dissertation (and was done with coursework) when she started her first year (first semester) of coursework, her writing and knowledge of teaching was vastly superior to mine (like not even in the same galaxy). This was because she had taught abroad for 20-years and she had published close to 50 or so articles before coming into the program. I'm not sure about your doctoral program, but even in my own cohort, the age range is anywhere from 25-46, with me right in the middle at 34. While we are all at the same or similar stages within a doctoral program, each respective cohort/classmate brings different levels of teaching experience, knowledge, and expertise into the classroom. This also means that they may be at a different part of their journey in life in regards to research paper writing or teaching compared to you, which is perfectly fine and nothing to be ashamed of. **Thirdly**, as someone who is getting his Ph.D in English Composition and Applied Linguistics, I tell all my Freshman students that writing is a skill that you never master and are constantly improving upon all throughout your life. It's no different at the doctoral level and frankly, is something that is a life-long venture. **Fourthly**, the reason why I implore you to stop comparing yourself to others is because of the potential person you could become. At my university, they send out monthly theses/dissertation E-mails for our department that states who will be defending and on what day/time. When you first enter the program, you never know any of those people because they're in cohorts so far above yours. But as time and the years go on, you start to realize that you do actually know some of the people defending because they are either from the cohorts 1-year before you, are in the same cohort, or are in the cohorts after yours. That happened to me and as someone who really struggled with getting my dissertation started and wasted basically 3.5 years of my eligibility being in a funk, I started to become a really cynical and jealous person. By comparing the speed of my progress and at what stage of the dissertation I was to that of others in my cohort, I started to get jealous and hateful toward my classmates due to their success, which really scared me. These were people who I loved, supported me, were intelligent and awesome classmates, and had worked their ass off (and made countless sacrifices) to defend and pass their dissertation defenses. I had to have one of those self-talk, self-reflection moments in my life and say \"no more.\" I had to tell myself that I had nobody to blame but myself for being in the predicament that I was in, that I needed to stop comparing myself to others, and finally, get my head out of my ass and start working. After this, I wrote my 3-chapters in 5-6 months (and successfully defended) and accomplished something I hadn't been able to do in 3.5 years. It's all about having a positive mindset and having a structured plan/schedule.\n4. **A doctoral program is a test in one's mental fortitude, especially in regards to it being a marathon, not a sprint.** I think there are different degrees of being mentally tough (Ex. overcoming death of a loved one, poverty, job stress, multi-tasking, raising a family, etc.). However, seeing a doctorate program out to the very end is a test of one's mental toughness over an extended period of time. This isn't a task where you overcome it within a day or a single class. At every point within a doctoral program, you have t exhibit your mental toughness and whether you come out on top depends solely on you. For me, the milestones to overcome in my doctoral program were: (**1**) getting feelings of inadequacy amongst my classmates who all had varying degrees of strengths and weaknesses (though at the time, I felt they were way smarter and talented than I was), (**2**) surviving the first semester, first year of coursework, (**3**) passing my qualifying portfolio (a test after the first semester, first year in my doctorate program to see if you continue on in the program. You pass, you continue on to the second semester, you fail, you are kicked out of the program), (3) survive the first year of coursework, (**4**) Finish and survive the 2-years of mandatory coursework, (**5**) write and successfully defend one's 3-chapter defense of your dissertation, and finally, (**6**) write and successfully defend your entire dissertation. I've done all but step 6. Being that I've been in my program for 6, going on 7-years now, I've seen students falter at each one of these stages for a variety of reasons: insecurity in one's skills, making excuses, lack of taking responsibility, time management, and not having a clear plan have been some of the main factors to these student's downfall. Every student in a doctoral program is going to experience hardship, bouts of depression, and varying degrees of stress. The question you have to ask yourself is are you going to succumb to it or get back up and keep moving forward.\n\nGood luck OP.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uoeq3v/out_of_my_depth/i8eti98/"}, "2453": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lollielolliex3", "Date": 1652415729, "Score": 2, "Body": "I recently finished my PhD in pharmaceutical science through a pretty good program and I would say the majority of people applying/joining the program didn't have any prior publications.

Additionally, I wasn\u2019t enjoying the day to day bench work, so it made coming into work a chore. Going into grad school, those can be avoided by just being meticulous about the school/lab you pick (I did recruitment over zoom from the other side of the country so it was difficult to get a detailed feel for the school and labs). From a financial standpoint, the downgrade in quality of life was difficult and to make only around $34-38K for 4 more years in an area with a relatively high cost of living, I\u2019d be missing out on pretty significant levels of income (just something to prepare for, but also a valid reason to leave if the opportunity cost of not working for a reasonable salary is too high for you). Also, I really missed the team focused environment in industry. A hallmark of a PhD education is independent thought and although I valued the freedom to pursue a project in whatever direction I chose, it can be a little isolating since you\u2019re really the only one with ownership over your project in the end. Lastly, I wasn\u2019t feeling that my research was very impactful. In industry, I felt closer to affecting patient outcomes which gave me satisfaction in my work.

Everybody at the lab would prefer if you asked for help to show you the equipment and maybe lend you a hand the first  few times you use it. That way, everyone will know you have at least some experience with it and will feel more confortable about you using it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Try to take up a definite ammount of space: Maybe start the day saying \"may I work over here? does it bother much?\" Or something like that, that way people can answer \"sure, it's ok\" or \"Could you please move over there? The place you picked is rather important for X or Y reason\".

I still sometimes forget, so what I do to cause less problems for my team is I sometimes (when I have some free time at the lab) clean up. I take everything that doesn't have a name (and has been sitting for days on the table) and clean it, and everything that is dry to its place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, maybe you're right and you're working with very difficult people.

What tangible and intangible benefits could it realistically bring to your life, and are those benefits worth the investment and sacrifice you'll have to put in?

Haha!). At the time, as a non-credentialed educator with several years of private/charter school teaching experience, EdD studies seemed as a window into academic writing and personal/professional advancement). \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the words of a certain principal. I had been sent to a prospective admin conference by my own admin, and then recommended by the same admin team to teach over the summer at a neighboring school. I applied to provide English and/or History curriculum. I\u2019m versatile! I\u2019ve even taught Intro to Spanish at the high school level, in addition to running their music program. The summer school principal\u2019s response to my application: \u201cThank you for your interest. We do not need a music teacher this summer.\u201d Pigeon hole central station!\n\nI transitioned into a PhD in Organizational Leadership after my university closed. I went on to complete a 7 month integral/holistic coaching program (after beginning the PhD) and it completely realigned my goals. It was beautiful.\n\nThe (as of now) midway PhD crisis I had was a personal one, as the material started to get much more business focused in some cases, and the dissertation vision felt unclear prior to arriving where I am now. I felt further from my original goals and interests (especially when I transferred and ended up in the business department, rather than the education department \u2014 now that I think on it, one of the best things that ever happened!). It forced me to own my education in a new way. I had to figure this out.\n\nThe dissertation has now grown from the coaching experience into a constructivist grounded theory study on the impact of embodiment/somatic coaching methods for self-identified organizational leaders. I resigned my music teaching position and music ministry work last year, went into full time lay ministry, and now direct a major trauma-informed/spiritual care line. The goal will be to retrofit my grad studies with a graduate certificate in Psychology at the close of the PhD in Organizational Leadership, to really build up the research and positive psych/human development and education pieces that I have gravitated toward in this very interdisciplinary PhD program.\n\nI realized that it was within my power to steer things back into my own court, by shaping my PhD experience through the research writing that I do and how I am apply my professional experience and skills. \n\nMoving into directorship positions in two non-profit organizations (in one case, supervising a critical social program with 40-50 staff/counselors/volunteers)\u2026it simply wouldn\u2019t have been able to happen had I not started this PhD and paired it with additional training in coaching. The one year I\u2019ve now served elsewhere after resigning from a decade as a music minister/educator was paramount to being considered for this new opportunity as well.\n\nI highly recommend career/transition/holistic life coaching for anyone making a major transition like this. The odd thing for me was that I ended up receiving tons of coaching/support from peers while I was making this transition. I had drafted my resignation prior to the sessions, but the atmosphere really put my mind/body/heart/soul full-in, ready to make the change. Due to the fact that I was enrolled at a coaching academy and benefitting from dyad coaching partnerships, I continue to have resources, and peers to sit with, to reinvent my approach, as I sit with them and hear their work (mostly as directors/researchers/practitioners in health care). I could not have done some of these literature reviews without sitting down with a coach working in mixed methods cancer research and just brainstorming for 20 minutes (my ideas; their compassionate ear). Sometimes we lose places to talk out loud and process when we are at the doctoral level. It becomes insular!\n\nI\u2019ve even opened an LLC where I am building forthcoming workshops and offering coaching (not plugging myself here for you! Haha! It was a major part of my journey in claiming my educational/professional space!).\n\nMy point is, your path is up to you. I stand in firm opposition to the concept of prestige programs, stacking cards to make money. It can\u2019t be about that for me. It doesn\u2019t have to sound logical to anyone else, though non-judgmental, non-leading feedback can be helpful!\n\nOne of my goals was to increase my income by a modest amount (a goal entirely separate from my education). Boom. 6-figures achievement unlocked, almost all work off-site, choose my own hours every day. Meaningful work. And the PhD isn\u2019t even done yet.\n\nFinding field work that validates your academic pursuits puts you on the path, because you are literally \u201cdoing what you came here to do.\u201d\n\nIt might look different for folks outside of the liberal arts and social/behavioral sciences, but I am living a \u201cchoose your own adventure book\u201d and it is thick.\n\nIn the future, an 18 unit GC in Psych feels necessary for me, in order to flesh out that piece of my graduate education that is missing and dig deeper into the things I have loved most about both the EdD and PhD studies. There is enough of an overlap between Organizational Leadership and Psychology to warrant this, and I know that this additional training/experience makes me a more viable professional, and opens up adjunct positions in social/behavioral sciences in the future, should I wish to pursue them.\n\nToward the unknown!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uphq4a/doing_a_phd_with_a_department_of_a_different/i8o4300/"}, "2777": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PrestigiousWar8243", "Date": 1652598401, "Score": 2, "Body": "I wish I paid more attention in my statistics course.

They are also not APA accredited. This may be why you have such a low stipend, but again double check. They do have much higher stipends it seems for other PhD programs at this school. \n\nalso a general note: I would look into whether this lack of APA accreditation is something to be worried about. I don't know if it is or isn't. I just know we were told to avoid non accredited programs when I was looking into psyc.

If my goal is a \"nice lifestyle\", I need to be clear about what \"a nice lifestyle\" means to me, what I need to do to get there, and then work hard to get there. Then it's not only working hard, it's working hard focused on that reward, moving toward the life that I want. Otherwise, I may be working hard to get something completely different from what I want. \n\nI'm near the end of my PhD. I have no intention of ever going back to a corporate job, I did that for a long time already. I got a job as assistant professor, I will start this Fall. It's not an R1 university, it's more of a balanced school with teaching and research. But I feel it's the perfect place for me. In a small, quiet town. Surrounded by nature. Everyone I met (faculty, staff, students) during my campus visit was very nice, and the the university has some some values that speak very dearly to me on a personal side. When I arrived there for the campus visit, I slept so well even though I had the job interviews next day. Because the place, the environment brings me a sense of peace and calm. \n\nSo, I believe I'll have the reward I want. But that didn't happen by chance, or just because I was working hard. Finishing my PhD could lead me to many different directions, most of them are not what I want in life, are not my definition of a \"nice lifestyle.\" Among the different possibilities, I had to think about the ones that are a better match for me.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uqao3j/when_does_it_end_feeling_burnt_out_postdefense/i8pxdw4/"}, "2875": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "rock_gremlin", "Date": 1652637024, "Score": 5, "Body": "Agreed.

There are plenty of people with advanced degrees who had a rotten semester and still got in. They may even like it as it shows some independence.\n\n*Worst case scenario, the course is a core component of a very competitive grad program (ask a prof in the area to be sure. Courses \"outside\" of a discipline might be fundamental to it, like a math class for many sciences including social sciences).\n\nIn this situation I'd seriously consider re-taking it, even if it doesnt erase or replace the former grade. You need that info to be successful in the grad program. It demonstrates you are serious about the field. Of course you will need an A or at worse a B. Ideally you would take it at the school you want to attend and get a letter of rec from that prof. \n\nTake a few graduate courses in the department you are applying to (whatever is allowed) and be a star. Professors are risk averse and will be inclined to a sure thing...but it isnt a guarantee, go in eyes open that getting in will involve some luck...they may do comparisons to the pool of applicants and in any particular year you might get beat out by a high achieving group. \n\nA really competitive program may have 100 applicants for each opening so have a plan B of a related field or 2 that would interest you.

I do emotions research in management, though not experiments (mostly via ESM), but this might be a good place to start!\n\nDepending on the area and your research question, you could try: \n- a critical incident or recall study with recall of \u201cfeeling sad\u201d, etc. (Check out Dunn &amp; Schweitzer, 2005 JPSP, studies 1-3; Pillay et al., 2020 OBHDP)\n- a video manipulation in which the participants watch a sad video or a happy video, etc. (see: Dunn &amp; Schweitzer, 2005, study 4; Mauss et al., 2005, Emotion;  Kugler et al., 2005, SPPS, study 2). \n\nSome other considerations: confounds are huge in emotion manipulations. Make sure to pilot your manipulation with confound checks for other emotions (e.g. a video of a cute starving endangered species might induce sadness AND guilt when you just want sadness). Also, there\u2019s some debate over what the control should be. If you are manipulating \u201csadness\u201d, should the control be \u201chappy\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d?  \n\nGood references for experimental research in management:\n- Colquitt (2008) - this is an editorial in AMJ encouraging more experiments, but also gets into some methods areas related to publishing in management\n- Podsakoff &amp; Podsakoff (2019) in LQ, this is a review of experimental methods in leadership as well as management more broadly. It gets into about everything experimental methods related including prepping manipulations and piloting. \n\nOn demographics, I usually measure before the study (e.g., send a survey with demographics out a week before the manipulation/\u201cmain\u201d study, which is great for if you are screening for a specific demographic) or at the end before they leave. My experience is only with online experiments (I started my PhD during COVID), but regardless you\u2019d want to avoid doing demographics between the manipulation and outcomes. For how long the manipulation lasts, I\u2019m not sure what to do, other than maybe pilot test and measure emotions over time. \n\nHope this helps!  I\u2019m afraid this is pretty much where my experiment knowledge ends.

Kudos to you for trying to fix this one\n- Small sample sizes\n- Terrible sampling methodology. college psych students are still the prime demographic, just as it was before the crisis\n- Poor measurement\n- p-hacking. There's a shocking amount of p=0.049 studies\n- Weak effect sizes. If the original effect size was 1 SD, but the replication found 0.2 SD, did it really replicate?\n- Sketchy statistics. Please consult a statistician, there's a shocking amount of psych students that I've seen in stats classes that have no idea what they just studied\n\nSo, make very sure that the effect upon which your study is built is either trivial (rich people do better on tests, wow how shocking), or has been replicated and replicated well. Read the original studies, read the follow-ups, read the replications, try to verify for yourself that they're doing real science.\n\nEdit: for priming specifically, the classic original studies about people walking slower, doing better on &lt;insert challange&gt; because they were thinking about money, etc were all bullshit and did not replicate when held up to scrutiny. There are some limited effects that have survived replication, but only a very diminished effect sizes (up to 90% smaller!)\n\nEdit 2: the best estimates I could find of replication success in marketing/management is 40%.

Not everyone works the same way, and a PI may be perfect for one student, but not for another (whether they're toxic or not). I think it's good to try to focus on how you can create a better environment for your yourself and your supervisor is crucial for this. In my uni we can contact someone from the grad school for advice when we have troubles with our supervisor. Even if it's very late in your candidature, if there is someone else with similar expertise that accepts to take over your project because your supervisor treats you like shit, they'll make it happen. Have you talked with the postdoc who helped you about your problems with your PI, lack of progress, and/or mental health? Or other people in your lab who witnessed your supervisor bashing you like you mentionned? If I were you, I think I'd seek help with all the services my uni proposes for changing supervisors. It sounds like your PI is one of those people who have microscopic levels of empathy and if you deal with depression and imposter syndrome, you don't want a PI like that. Bullying your student because they couldn't do experiments in the middle of a damn pandemic???? ugh. There's no way their name wasn't brought up to student services before. And if you're the first to deal with this kind of behaviour from them, I hope your uni will help you changing this situation because it's unacceptable. And a good supervisor should know their students can struggle with self-doubt. They are here to make you a good researcher, which includes confidence and resilience skills. I think it should be part of their job to make sure they give you the support you need to build resilience when facing self doubt and major delays (especially when it's out of your control, like your experiments). Your supervisor is failing at his job with you.\n\nI would also seek for mental health student services. I don't know how I'd have survived if I didn't go to counselling when I started getting overwhelmed with anxiety. My uni provides free counselling sessions for PhD students, which led me to seek therapy to dig deeper. Instead of fixing my anxiety, I got a bunch of other mental illness diagnoses that I didn't want thrown in the face, so I threw it back to the disability services of my uni \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f jokes apart, depression was one of them and it really messes up with my progress and imposter syndrome. So I declared my diagnoses to my uni and all my supervisors received a mental health action plan that explains how my conditions can sometimes impact my work, and how they can help me to adapt my work and candidature around it. They can't say anything about it. And if they don't respect my mental health needs, I can seek external help. I don't know where you live and how good your uni is with mental health, but if you have access to such services, use it. \n\nThen, also regarding mental health, do you have a good support network? Do you have access to any form of therapy? A partner, a family member or a friend you can talk to when you need? When I'm depressed I tend to isolate myself, and most of the time it's my friends who snap me out of it. They drag me to a Cafe or a random outdoor activity. My family is far, so I make sure I contact them often and it usually makes me feel better. Can you afford to take time (considering you may be able to get help from uni to manage your schedule around your mental health) to start/continue hobbies you enjoy? Ways to connect to nature if you like it? If you waste time staring at your computer screen with writer's block, might as well make this time useful to try clearing your head with something you like to do.\n\nNow. You say you feel absolute hatred for the PhD and have ZERO motivation to finish and ohhh I've been there, thought of giving up, but like you I don't have the luxury to give up. So I try to focus on the why I started it. I don'tget excitedny physics but maybe you do. If not, how about the thrill of just discovering something new? Creating knowledge? I always thought research was cool because there are endless possibilities to satisfy my curiosity. I just try to remember what made me so eager to do it in the beginning. And if it's not enough, well, I can always count all the reasons I can't afford to give up. It sucks, but sometimes it's what works the best, a little reality slap in my face on what are my priorities in life. \n\nThen, you can also check all the ressources on writers block on the internet. I know some work well with me, but most don't, so I'm not going to throw you all the classic pomodoro, check-lists, scheduling a routine etc etc techniques. Most of the time, if i get over the lack of motivation, I just lack discipline to follow these techniques. But if you haven't already, maybe worth a try? My uni also provides workshops for this stuff.\n\nHope I could give you some insight, and good luck, you've made it so far so i hope you have the strength to go further \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcaa", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/ur4g4s/advices_on_getting_over_selfdoubt_in_writing_my/i8xphvs/"}, "3176": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "wizardyourlifeforce", "Date": 1652790017, "Score": 0, "Body": "Not sure whether I completely agree, but this a refreshing take at the opposite end of all the posts here that are like \u201cmy advisor frowned slightly when I was talking to them, should I drop out of my PhD program?\u201d", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ur86gk/i_get_along_well_with_everyone_ive_encountered_in/i8xrgyv/"}, "3177": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Crona_something", "Date": 1652790144, "Score": 3, "Body": "I second the first response.

I guess since you said your a computer science phd, I understand how you may think sometimes it can be useless, if, hypothetically you worked as a software engineer. One would think, hey, you could have gotten a job with a BS CS. But I think it could also vary by fields. I\u2019m a BS statistics right now. With my jobs, I could get entry level data analyst jobs which don\u2019t require a whole lot of stats and more so data wrangling skills. Not my cup of tea. With a MS in statistics, could get a much higher paying As a data scientist, but again, the job function would maybe be some more data wrangling, some statistical modeling here and there, and then leading some junior analysts, again, nothing groundbreaking here either. But a phd in statistics, I\u2019ve seen folks with those end up not working in research labs (some do), but end up working dep of defense projects etc. also, I think a phd just innately gives you an upper hand when moving up in a company.\n\nSay you get a phd right, sure you start out as a researcher. But what if you think, gee, I\u2019m done with researching in industry, I kinda want to move up. You see some internal higher up director positions, you could apply, and most likely even get the job just cause you have a phd and your competing with possibly others masters degrees. My father doesn\u2019t have a phd, but he has a MS in engineering, and despite him putting all the work on project proposals it\u2019s often the phds on his team that get their name put first on the proposals, or referred to the most due to the project needing to \u201csell money\u201d.\n\nI agree that it may be \u201cuseless\u201d for non research related jobs. But one\u2019s career trajectory is so long that no one just gets pigeonholed into research their whole life. I know I wouldn\u2019t. But often times, it just helps to have that credibility when applying for more senior roles in a company. Especially in tech or defense related fields.\n\nMy motive for doing a phd is not for the sake of just being a leadership position tho. I finished my bachelors and I enjoy statistical theory and have some areas I\u2019d like to research and go in depth with further. But, I don\u2019t see myself just sticking myself in research my whole life either. At a certain point I think becoming the director or senior level of a company is the end goal, and at later stages of a career the phd helps tremendously with that, even for non research roles. I feel like a lot of folks push the narrative of a phd being a research only degree, which it is to an extent, but people don\u2019t emphasize the innate value it has to when applying to senior roles.

Because I think \"advisor\" is a better word to describe what happens in my case. He is not there really to supervise me, he doesn't control much of what I do, he often doesn't watch closely what I'm doing. I have a lot of freedom, I don't feel like I'm being closely supervised. But he is there to advise me on the work that I'm doing.  \n\n2 - Since he is there to advise me on the work that I'm doing, he is also clear about the things he can help me with (and the things he can't). That is very helpful. As you said, the guidelines are vague. He made it much less vague for something very important. \n\n3 - Since he is there to advise me on the work that I'm doing, things change a lot depending on what is the work that I'm doing and how much advice I need. For example, there are periods when we meet every week, there are times when it takes more than a month to meet. There are times I ask very specific advice, there are times when I need very broad advice. He is very flexible. \n\n4 - When I say he is advising me on the work, that work is not only research. It included teaching, it included getting a job. \n\n5 - My advisor is very insightful, straightforward, effective. He doesn\\`t waste time talking about things that are not relevant. During paper presentations, he usually asks questions that go straight to the heart of the issue. Although that is scary during a presentation, it\\`s great to have an advisor like that. It there is a critical flaw in my paper, reasoning, method, he detects that very quickly and points that out to me. I can avoid many dangers and traps because of that. \n\n6 - He goes beyond what is expected of him. I feel free to talk to him about anything, not only things that are related to work. I'm now in my last year, and I think he more like a friend than just an advisor now. We can talk about work, health, family, hobbies, life in general. \n\n7 - He is very respectful. He respect my effort, he respects my ideas, he respects who I am, he respects my time. Of course there are disagreements and differences, it doesn't mean he will accept everything I say. But our disagreements are discussed in a very civilized way, and he presents his arguments and perspectives very well.

(Not precluding that there may come a point where you want to tell your boss.) It can help A LOT just to get support from a peer. They may be in the same boat as well. It also sounds like your girlfriend has been somewhat supportive. Are you able to talk about these feelings with her? I find it helpful to talk about the \"shoulds,\" too. Such as \"I feel like I should be happy and grateful for this job, but...\" Even spending time with others for fun, not talking about work, is helpful.\n\nIdentify the trigger -- Did anything happen that you think brought on these feelings? Obviously, the pandemic. The way you wrote also sounds like there may have been a recent death in your family. If you can identify a trigger for your current feelings, it might lead you towards the best solution.\n\nLook at the big picture -- This can take a few forms, but I think one way to feel less trapped is to think about your other options. Are there other jobs you would consider? If you moved home, where might you work (or would you take time off)? How would this affect your girlfriend, as well? Sometimes looking at what options are available can help you shift your perception of your current job, even if you don't end up leaving.\n\nI hope you start feeling better soon.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/urshrz/developing_anxiety_at_my_first_position_postphd/i8zqbrb/"}, "3282": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Average_Iris", "Date": 1652820303, "Score": 1, "Body": "I don't know, in my lab only a few postdocs have an office.

A PhD is often about not giving up, despite the uncertainties that we have about ourselves, our research, our future, etc.\n\nI will write a few things below with my perspective and experience about a few things you wrote.\n\n1 -  My first year was really overwhelming. Very common. \n\n2 -  I'm much older than you. Not a problem. \n\n3 - Why should I care if I'm not as amazing as my cohort? This is not a competition to see who is the most amazing person. Or at least it shouldn't be. \n\n4 - Nobody cares about grades here, unless the person does so terribly that they need to leave the program according to the university rules. \n\n5 - About having ideas, I always remember something I've heard from Neil Gaiman. Someone asked him how he got his ideas. And he said that ideas are worthless. Anyone can have ideas if they really spend time doing that. Transforming ideas into successful results is what really matters, and that can happen even with terrible ideas. \n\n6 - I think it was around my 3rd year that my advisor said my work wasn't at the PhD level, it was still at the master's level. You don't need to be \"up to par\" from the beginning, focus on getting there. That's why you're still a student.\n\n7 - If you don't know who to talk to, you should find a solution for that. Your advisor, other professors, colleagues, etc. This is not something you should do alone, by yourself. I got a lot of help from many people about how to do better. \n\n8 - Working more or working harder is not necessarily the same as getting more results, specially if you get exhausted and burn out. I force myself to stop, relax, and do other things to stay productive. Different people work in different ways, finding the way that works for you is a very important part of the journey.\n\n9 - A PhD pushes us to our limits. And that makes our strengths and weaknesses much more evident. You don't know yourself or your abilities, you are in the process of really knowing them. That was extremely important to me, to put my strengths to work instead of worrying too much about my weaknesses. For example, I know I'm far from being the smartest one here.

Academia isn't a meritocracy, in most cases you NEED nepotism or cronyism to succeed. I have seen brilliant people with top tier publications go from post-doc to post-doc while I have seen the most absurd example: a 25yo fresh off her PhD getting a prof. tenure with zero publications. She was the niece of the director (mind you, this is not some banana republic but a western-European country with a top-100 university). Another example is an older guy that I know, he worked in government for a while and then he told me he sent a bunch of e-mails (unsolicited) to different universities and one of them offered him an assistant professorship in policy. He recommended this method to me unironically. He also happened to tell me that he worked in the consulate for that country (Canada) and had a role in some large transnational partnership contracts.\n\nYou will be even more shocked if you have experience in academia or other public research, a lot of the times the organizations offering grants (which are a handful) and the prestigious people writing grants (also a small clique of high ranking profs) know each other on a personal level. Their favours can determine which of PhD or Postdocs can get funding or not, or who can get funding for a tenure track. I have seen it directly happen with an appointment with my own supervisor. They had multiple candidates and they unilaterally went with her choice, the single person she had known on a personal basis, without looking at any merit, experience or research of the other candidates.\n\nI funded my own PhD by landing a decent grant after countless applications. Already knew about this by working in a lab prior, so I never even had the idea to get into academia long-term. It is no different from getting into politics. The most disappointing thing after my PhD is that I found public and national research centers also suffer from grant cronyism and invest heavily in grant milking. The only way to avoid this is to work for private research, which is limited to a small selection of fields and is very hard to get in to, but at least holds somewhat of an idea of a meritocracy. But your skills still hold a lot of value and merit outside of research.\n\nMy advice: get in to industry. Get your foot in the door and you will notice you have a massive head start in terms of mental resistance, deep research skills and communication skills. Industry is way more appreciative of people at the bottom and you are still young. A ton of opportunities are out there. Happen to know a literature graduate that is now working in NLP as a data scientist, which earns more money, respect and work-life balance than any postdoc or adjunct can dream of.

For context, I am also in the phase of my PhD where I am struggling to identify a research question. \n\n1. A good place to begin is to ask what is at the intersection of these:\n  - what am I truly interested in studying? What do I care about enough?\n - check if any term paper/project you have worked on sparked that kind of interest.\n- I don\u2019t know if you have supervisors mapped to you, but check if there is anything in their area of expertise that excites you. \n\n2. Trust the process. I know it sounds abstract advice, but the discomfort you are facing is because the process of discovery of a viable research question is a rocky road. The confusion and discomfort reflects the nature of the process. \n\n3. Talk to others about your interests (not necessarily people in your field or even in research) and through this process of articulation, you may discover something of value. \n\n4.

I was going to get a full time job while I worked on my phd and just take it slow. I suppose in my case, I had completed the coursework for it, and didn't have to take any more classes. Fortunately enough, my advisor is the dean for the undergraduates and was able to get me a part time position under the office. I was honestly stressed out my ass figuring out what to do. I found some jobs, but they wouldnt allow me to work part time on my phd, in terms of location and time. They were like 8 hours away from the university by plane, and taking time to go back and forth for conprehensive exams, and then defending, i didnt find reasonable. Started in the fall of 2020, and will be completed by December of next year. Fortunately for my situation, I'm living at home with my parents while pursuing my phd, so that definitely takes a load of stress off my shoulders.\n\nSo. I would suggest, if you can complete it part time while working fulltime and taking it slow, would be the best solultion. Based off what you said, there's a lot left to do, including the writeup and defending of your dissertation, just isn't feasible in a couple months. \n\nAlso I understand the not wanting to quit thing.

Now, before you do that, I'll add some \"real-world\" perspective:\n\n1) regarding p-hacking: if everything involved in data analysis is reported honestly, there's no real problem with integrity here. P-hacking is subjective; the key is honesty. If someone has a problem with what you're doing they can flag it in review. Every study has flaws and caveats, the ethical problem arises when you try to hide them and present something that is incongruent with what was actually done (i.e. lie).\n\n2) If you are not the first or last author, people won't interpret this as \"your work\". In other words, it's generally assumed that middle authors did not contribute to study design, interpretation, etc. Nobody will ever look closely enough at this paper to tie it directly to you in a derogatory way etc.\n\n3) including all authors on revisions etc. is normal and an arguably ethical responsibility when submitting a paper and listing someone as co-author.

You don't need a PhD to be an expert. If you are passionate about marketing, you should be closer to the actual action. \n\nThat being said, PhD funding in marketing in the US is usually related to taking a job as a teaching assistant or research assistant at the university. You become an employee, and receive payment for that (stipend), as well as other things like health insurance and tuition waiver. The amount you receive is usually enough for one person to live, but not with much luxury. That depends heavily on the cost of living of the place. \n\nMarketing PhDs usually take around 5 years to complete, but it really depends on several factors. Usually, you keep receiving a stipend as long as you stay in the program. If it takes 6 years, you get paid for 6 years. \n\nI don't know what opportunities NYU offers, but some programs have opportunity for extra income. I've been teaching, for example, and getting more money for that. \n\nAnd, since you only mentioned NYU, I guess I should say that Marketing PhD programs are extremely competitive.

So I\u2019m a PhD student in England in a STEM subject, so I\u2019m not sure how helpful I can be but I\u2019ll try! \nSo when applying for a PhD there\u2019s usually two routes you can go down. Firstly, you can find a university you like, email a supervisor and propose a project. They\u2019ll usually chat to you over zoom or in person, and let you know if they already have any funding allocations. If not, you go down a competition funded route, where you apply with them to get the project funded. You usually apply for multiple research bodies and cross your fingers and hope, lol. It\u2019s a longer winded process, but you have more control on the project title if there\u2019s something super specific you want to do. \n\nThe other route, is applying for phds which already have allocated funding for a set title. You can find these online, although  I applied through findaphd- they have phds all over the world and you can filter it based on funding. With this, you still have to propose a project, but set on the title that\u2019s already been awarded funding. You go through the normal interview process, submit to the university and usually (or in my case) do a project presentation to 3 professors. It\u2019s scary, lol. \n\nThe funding you get for both is pretty similar. It usually covers a stipend for living costs, research costs and expenses (ie travel, laptops). This really ranges, from 4-16k on average (obviously depending on the subject, university etc). This stretches throughout your entire PhD, mine is 3 years (but we have 4 years worth of funding, just in case). \n\nIf you aren\u2019t awarded funding, but are awarded a place, I know the government can give grants out, but I think it\u2019s dependent on a multitude of factors I\u2019m not completely familiar with. If you\u2019re unsure, email the university. \n\nI hope this helped even a little. I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s like where you are but if I can help at all let me know.

I started year 1 when the world was normal, but then covid kicked in during 2020-2022.\n\nI feel like the positives of getting both in class and distance learning, both for learning and teaching as a TA, meant that I definitely got to see adaptation in academics; and especially how older lecturers and professors struggle with technology and it was nice to have an area where younger people had an advantage (both myself and the undergraduates too).\n\nI prepared a lot for the necessary classes to pass year 1 and 2, and truthfully speaking, it was nice to have classes to discuss detailed topics with your peers and professors. And it was also fun (to a large extent) to sit in and audit undergraduate classes on topics that are outside of my subject. Obviously, if you don\u2019t have time, you can\u2019t do that, but if you plan ahead and are good at adult learning there are plenty of hours in the day.\n\n\nIn fact, before covid hit, I was looking forward to the weekends to hang out with friends and make new friends because unlike me, they were only free on Fridays-Sundays, whereas graduate students are kind of on a perpetual weekend.\n-You can work at 2am or 2pm, you can do your readings and write ups in your room, the library or some cool coffee shop in the middle of the city or a lush park. You\u2019re free to be an academic nomad, and the scholarship/stipend should give you security that you\u2019re doing something constructive and useful with your life. Someone or some institution has faith in you, above all other graduate students who applied and didn\u2019t get in, to pursue your own research interests and they\u2019re paying you to do that. That is both a privilege and a sign that you\u2019re worthy of that position.\n\n\nAs for teaching, I found it quite rewarding, both face to face and over zoom. It might be anxious at first, but you\u2019ll grow into it and it\u2019s an opportunity to guide, present, answer questions, pose questions and develop rapport with young minds who are smart enough to get to that level. Marking is a drag, no doubt about it, but there is a brief moment say up to 5-10 essays in, where you feel useful and happy to be doing something meaningful \u2013 but obviously by essay 50-75, it\u2019ll be slog. Pace yourself and treat it like a job, not everything is meant to be fun, but it\u2019s also a good learning experience in being professional. It\u2019s what academics is really like.\n\n\nAs for fieldwork and research, so long as you can get covid permission to enter a country or institution, it\u2019s a great chance to see the world in a new light. Fewer people are travelling at the moment, and so enjoy your time in the sun or snow. Smile, breath in the new air, visit coffee shops and restaurants \u2013 try and do work, get bitten by mosquitos \u2013 visit local libraries (it\u2019s fascinating seeing how different countries provide library services and the kinds of peoples that use them, it\u2019s also nice to see young parents teaching their children how to read, older people using IT equipment and all that other slice of life stuff too), and give yourself a mental note/responsible plan to do your work. Don\u2019t work yourself out, take some days out, but never completely disconnect and never completely throw yourself into it. It\u2019s a process and it\u2019s important not to get burned out.\n\n\nImposter syndrome, financial worries, world worries, relationship worries and all the other reoccurring motifs of doing a PhD will hit you at some time no doubt, but deal with each problem one at a time; and the best I can say is that if you\u2019re suited to your course, your research and your professor, you are where you need to be and just like any other college or job there are bumps and obstacles. They are challenges for you to meet and overcome, you can do it, because you\u2019re the best person to overcome your own challenges.\n\n\nIn terms of work, steady and regular beats excessive and then lean. Try and do a little every day or every other day and ramp up and down as needed. I don\u2019t regret doing mine at all.

Granted, we should not make it a habit of shying away from challenging tasks, but there are times when moving on to sections where writing is easier is going to be a more efficient use of time. Be prepared to take time off from writing to freshen up the mind with new ideas and research. It is important to realize that there are going to be brief breaks from writing, and that you can take these breaks without feeling guilty.\n\nBlock out writing time: While it is important to keep writing, and to maximize the time and resources available to you, for larger writing projects such as your thesis, it is smart to set aside blocks of time for your writing. As you keep making progress in your project and getting words onto the page, you will also be helping mitigate the panic that often hangs over your project when you are stuck and writing stops. When it comes to thesis writing, it is obvious that the stakes are far higher than with any writing projects that you might have completed in your undergrad years. Unlike the meticulous study strategies that you developed in order to get through the comprehensive exams, completing the thesis will allow you to begin developing a set of valuable research and writing skills.\n\nTaking time to think through these tips at an early stage of your graduate studies will help make the [dissertation proposal writing](https://american-writers.org/dissertation_proposal.php) process run smoother, and strengthen the integrity of your work. Research about the experiences that graduate students have writing their dissertations suggests that many students are not always sure what is expected of them as they start the process. Knowing that depends, many PhD students hesitate about starting the thesis-writing process too early, thinking it is better to wait until they have done an extremely rigorous study on a subject.

At some point I realised that, although I love science to the bottom of my heart, an academic career just isnt worth the lost quality of life. \n\nI am still pursuing a phd but now with the sole focus of getting it done rather quickly and switchting to industry asap. If I were to pursue an academic career I would be way more keen on churning out papers and getting a magna or summa. But in industry, as long as those beautiful three letters are next to your name, people dont really care how good your phd was. They only care about experience.\n\nNow I work 7:30-3:30/4:30 and once I get home, I am done. I might spend 20 minutes in the evening planning my next day but thats it. Do I work my 40h/week? Nope, definitely not. Do I care? Also nope. I am only getting paid 65% of my work hours (until recently only 50%) so my PI can be happy if I am in the lab for 40h. And she is happy because, as long as I bring the results, she cant complain.\n\nEarly on, she did make some comments where I realised she wanted to \"nudge\" me a bit into working more hours but both times I decisively pushed against it stating that I would not do it. Since then we have a great working relationship and nothing has come up ever since.\n\nYou always have to remember that PIs have gone through immense pressure and competition to get to a coveted professorship. I always liken it to evolutionary selection. Only the ones that have such a \"competitive\" mindset actually succeed in getting tenure, and thats why they normalize and internalize their behaviour and expect no different from their peers. \nDo not fall for this and understand where they are coming from. If you dont want to go along the same path you dont have to follow their ethics.\n\nIn the end, it boils down to your personality.

You have skills, even if its not your immediate field. Let me remind you that you did a PhD, if you don't have skills then no one has. You don't need to persue a postdoc in your niche field, you can look broader than that as well. Be open and realistic about positions but also have a plan, people respect that and you are after all supposed to be an independent researcher. Try and tailor your CV to the job posting, i like to use my cover letter and literally copy and paste the job description followed by bullet points on how im able to fulfill it. This helps recruiters more than the people you will work with but you need to get past them. However, taking something that won't advance you is a mistake, you might end up wasting more time than a few month long cv gap. As an example, I moved from infectious disease to stem cells, but I still do molecular biology. \n\nNot all postdocs are actually published on job boards, look for research institutions and identify a group leader that's in the field you are interested in and send an email. This is not uncommon to do and you might get better responses than cold applying to job applications which are handled by HR people that have no clue what you bring. \n\nIt's hard out there but it will work out, the fact that you are finishing a PhD speaks volumes about your capabilities and someone will see it, even if it takes a while.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uw9mhj/a_disheartening_process_for_looking_for_a/i9qasgs/"}, "4682": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "yourfriendemry", "Date": 1653340739, "Score": 5, "Body": "I've been doing a \"9-5\" Ph.D for about 2.5 years now.

No one can be laser-focused on reading articles for 8 hours straight. Heck, even if you switch between reading, writing, research/lab, etc. it's not sustainable. I actually count social time at work as work hours, because you never know what you're going to get out of a casual conversation with people. I even count dinners at conferences. Really any situation where you have to be \"on.\" \n\nYou also have to be able to cut yourself some slack, especially early on and just know that things will even out.

Here are some answers based off what Ive experienced. \n\n1. I think it is based on what kinda bioinformaticist you want to be. If you want to be more of a pipeline developer then you should focus on building your language portfolio. If you want to be more of a subject matter expert than focus more on the biological concepts and try to become proficient at one or two languages. If you want to be more of a liaison between software engineers and non-computer savy scientist then you have to become a jack of all trades type of person. Ultimately, it just depends. But to offer a more concrete answer I would say having one language you are pretty good that can do advance stats is good, one language you are at least ok with that is more broad like python is helpful, and lastly understanding how databases and machine learning is always a good plus \ud83d\ude42\n\n2. Yes, so again it depends. I interviewed for one job and they wanted me to complete a coding prompt and submit it back to them by the end of the week. That was a heavy coding based bioinformaticist position. I had a different interview where they wanted to hear about my various bioinformatic based projects that I have started and completed. Most of the time I believe interviewers are trying to gauge where your level of coding skills are, how willing you are to learning new skills, where your level of biological expertise are (depending on what you studied in the past), and your communication skills. \n\n3. I did do an internship during my PhD! It didn't help much but it did introduce me to different project/skill set that I could talk about during my interviews. Of course now I don't use any of those skills. \n\n4. Again this just depends. In my first job I was a Bioinformaticist who worked with FDA and NIH projects and everything was regulated so not a lot of new pipelines and more rinse and repeat. At my current job, it is strictly NIH funded projects so am coding more but using more stat analysis than building big complex pipeline (which I hate doing). My scripts typically don't go past 150 lines of code ( that includes comments). My friend is a post doc who codes better than me and hes in academia but he doesn't develop new programs or packages. So again it all depends on what you want to do. \n\nUltimately, bioinformatics is a bigger field than what people see on the surface. You can kinda carve your on path in it depending on what your skills are. \n\nI help this helps and if you want more detailed answers I would need to know what you want to do in the future and what your current skill sets is in. \n\nDr. J", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uwe216/bioinformaticist_advice_qa/i9sv2ue/"}, "4817": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "openbordersvpn3", "Date": 1653396946, "Score": 2, "Body": "To be honest it sounds like you could easily do something that would overlap both areas.

If you have the option and feel a switch of dissertation advisors is absolutely necessary to finish the entirety of your dissertation, do it. I'd much rather make this change early on in my dissertation writing as opposed to late in the game. Perhaps E-mail or schedule a meeting with your program director, have several good reasons as to why you want to make this change, and see if it is possible. If you get the ok, E-mail a professor that you think would make a good new dissertation advisor and see if they would accept to take you on as an advisee. \n2. In saying that, before making this decision, make sure you know that there is actually a professor in your department that can offer you the time and support you are looking for during your dissertation writing. Sometimes there isn't and you are stuck with the best of a limited talent pool. This is where asking some of your cohort mates or other students in your program can come in handy. Ask how they like their own dissertation advisor, perhaps ask them the pros and cons of their dissertation advisor. \n3. I've said this in previous threads but your dissertation advisor doesn't always have to be an expert on your dissertation topic. I always tell prospective dissertation writers in my own program to ask themselves this question when deciding on a dissertation advisor: Do I trust this advisor/professor to get me out of here in a 5-year window? What I factor into choosing a good dissertation advisor is the type of feedback they offered on assignments (when I took their course), how they are personality-wise, how we got along in class, and how easy they are to meet with (both in-person and online). If anything, your dissertation readers can be experts on your dissertation topic. \n4. If you have the option at your university, this is where a university writing center tutoring session would come in handy. I've been a tutor at my institution for 5.5 years now and I have worked with Master's and doctoral students working on every stage of their thesis/dissertation. At my institution, you have the option to ask to work with a doctoral tutor who is familiar with the dissertation writing process and can give you a lot of helpful feedback, as well as create a general outline to follow for a chapter 2, 3, or whatever chapter your currently working on at that time. If you are not getting the consistent feedback, direction, and support you need from a dissertation advisor, a writing center tutor may be the next best thing. \n5. I think my last suggestion would be to see if you could schedule an appointment with other professors in your program or professors who are an expert on your dissertation topic and pick their brain in regards to a general outline you could follow for your dissertation.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/uwvkom/how_to_deal_with_an_absent_supervisor/i9ueg46/"}, "4885": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BellaMentalNecrotica", "Date": 1653421005, "Score": 4, "Body": "I highly recommend seeing a therapist.

This is an international market, and a very competitive one.

For context - I\u2019m an R1 admin who\u2019s been involved in degree creation and support work.\n\nPhD programs, if done right, are a huge amount of work and a massive investment, even in a field with lower startup costs like English (for example, you don\u2019t have to pay to fit out lab space like in Physics or Microbiology). If your university doesn\u2019t have a PhD program in a particular field, it would likely take several years to get a core body do faculty together, assemble the internal proposal for creation of the degree, assemble the curriculum, get permission from key groups in the university, and then to get any external permission from accreditors or other regulators. If further faculty hires need to be made to cover the additional teaching (you\u2019re adding graduate courses to the teaching load) then those will need to happen either before approval or in tandem - which is a lot of work in itself.  Doctors programs can take the better part of a decade to go from an initial idea to matriculating a first cohort, and then the real work starts - you actually have to run the program.\n\nTLDR: if your university doesn\u2019t have a PhD program in your field, they won\u2019t be able to make one in a timeframe that\u2019s meaningful to you.\n\nOn the second point - if schools take their own alums - it\u2019s a regional thing. It\u2019s much more common in continental Europe where members of a research group will stay on after graduation. It\u2019s less common in the UK. It\u2019s almost unheard of in the US, unless you come back as a senior hire many many years after you finish your PhD. If you want to come back and teach at your undergrad, find a PhD program that can set you up well for that type of school (R1, liberal arts college, etc.). Not every program is well equipped to put you in a good place to be competitive at every type of school.\n\nFinally, without going into too much depth, do your back end research before you pursue a PhD, particularly in the humanities or social sciences. The job market outlook is not good. If you\u2019re interested in English, go look at the MLA jobs report - it\u2019s bleak. If you do go the PhD route and finish, your odds of ending back up at your undergrad are slim. There tends to be a narrow window where folks get a first TT faculty job and then slim windows around promotion to Associate or Full Professor when they can move around. The jobs that are open at those times are your options.\n\nHappy to take questions here or in chat.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uvkvnh/asking_university_to_add_new_phd_program/ia0513g/"}, "5180": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "NotAHost", "Date": 1653523572, "Score": 8, "Body": "I was talking to the finance department about \u201cy\u2019all know none of the grad students work 20 hours right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYup, everyone turns a blind eye.\u201d\n\nI was very tempted to report to department of labor after I graduated just to see if anything actually happens.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uxh724/phd_students_demand_wage_increases_amid_rising/ia0560o/"}, "5181": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Weekly-Ad353", "Date": 1653524833, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yeah, those salaries + bonuses + stock from huge tech corporations in HCOL are insane.\n\nI live in medium-ish COL, work 40 hours a week WFH, low pressure, great W-L balance, medium-sized pharmaceutical company in the sciences.\n\n10x is pretty sick though.

Here's a potter who has been doing it for 45 years at that point, and things still aren't perfect for him. Why am I so concerned with perfection when an expert still has things go wrong? That revelation alone was probably worth the entire degree.\n\nSo... Find a hobby where it's next to impossible to be perfect and just learn to go with it.

It's never a 1:1 creation. There are always things that could have been better, but as an artist you just have to embrace that lack of perfection.\n\nPerfection is a complete fallacy anyway; it's just up to you to realize that and internalize it.

I personally was fairly lucky in that my supervisor was extremely supportive and had a steady funding stream, but I've seen very talented colleagues give up on research because of the toxicity.

These are the students who publish a lot, win a bunch of school/conference awards and fellowships. So, when a student comes along who isn't immediately successful, they see it as the student not working hard enough, or just not putting in the effort.\n2. The university system cares a lot, arguably exclusively, about their faculty bringing in money. When a student doesn't produce enough to satisfy the funding agency, this can cause tension between PI and student.\n3. (Some) academics are just egotistical a\\*\\*holes. I've been in conferences with the douchebag that tears apart graduate students making their first professional presentation. I've seen committee members making life miserable during their student's comprehensive/progress updates, for no good reason. A lot of this happens because our system reinforces the idea that if you've 'succeeded', you're special and have permission to behave horribly with people who are still fighting their way up.\n\nI'm more on the academic side than industry (as a postdoc in a national lab), I've got to admit that we need to embrace management training to the same extent as in industry.

You are guided by your project lead and incentivized by your paycheck (and the hope of future raises) to do well, where \u201cdo well\u201d means \u201ccontribute to the company\u2019s output. Your immediate superiors who are most familiar with your work are (by odds) better-qualified than anybody else to gauge your productivity. Your bosses are guided by their bosses to lead well and maximize productivity (KEY POINT: it\u2019s relatively clear what \u201cproductivity\u201d is in industry: it\u2019s anything that increases profits) *and* incentivized by their paycheck. The executives are guided by shareholders (i.e. the owners of the company) to maximize profits and are incentivized by their paychecks, stocks, and bonuses.\n\nAt every step from shareholders to executives to worker bees there is an incentive structure in place to guide the work being done. Even a really toxic workplace can still have this coordinating incentive structure and still be profitable (at least in the short term), but smart businesses realize they benefit long-term from being a pleasant place to work. You\u2019ll find that toxic workplaces in industry that stay profitable indefinitely usually have something else going for them that makes them desirable to workers like being incredibly prestigious.\n\nSince when you\u2019re a good, productive worker you\u2019re providing your superiors exactly what they want (which helps *them*) it\u2019s not surprising that you get praised. In fact, your bosses bosses might\u2019ve even said \u201cmake sure you praise them when they do well\u201d.\n\nNow consider academia. What is the work of a PhD student? Or TT faculty? Or professor? Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re talking about R1\u2019s and R1abbes (haha see what I did there?). What is your productivity? Who can tell? There\u2019s no overarching end goal like profits/losses to serve as guide, and in this age of hyperspecialization no department head can really tell whether Professor A in subfield B is doing better research than Professor C in subfield D. You know who\u2019s best-qualified to judge Professor A\u2019s work? Some guy at another university 1,000 miles away who\u2019s also active in subfield B.\n\nHow do you tell who\u2019s even *worthy* of praise in situations like this? You can look at objective metrics like h-index, outside funding, or\u2014\n\n#OH WAIT\n\nIt\u2019s all about outside funding. Right. I forgot.\n\nIt\u2019s not quality of research or h-index or how well liked you are by students, those don\u2019t mean shit without pulling in outside funding.

It\u2019s a relatively fixed NSF+NIH+DOE etc. pie you\u2019re fighting over.\n\nTl,dr: If industry is a bunch of people on a beach making a sand castle together, academia is the crowd at Walmart on Black Friday, trampling over each other and ripping laptops out of each other\u2019s hands.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uzk7o9/phd_vs_industry/iadxnbh/"}, "5756": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TakeOffYourMask", "Date": 1653793833, "Score": 3, "Body": "It\u2019s so gratifying hearing people at places like NASA and SpaceX say \u201cthis is great\u201d about your work all the time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uzk7o9/phd_vs_industry/iadxuct/"}, "5757": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "justaverageuser77", "Date": 1653794419, "Score": 1, "Body": "What industry jobs can you take as a PhD student?

I'll give my perspective, maybe something I write can be useful. I will answer each question in order:\n\n\\- This is often very hard. Since we're researching something, there are many times that people can't provide a good feedback because they don't know either. They can tell basic stuff, they can sometimes point to some alternatives. But, other than that, I had usually to find my own answers, try new things, and see what seems to work. \n\n\\- It's easy to lose focus if we start reading things that are tangentially related. Even when they are very related, one paper leads to another paper, which leads to another paper, etc. I recommend being very careful, time is limited, and it should be used for things that will help you. \n\n\\- I really don't know. What I usually expect is for people to already have some topics in mind long before starting a PhD. I knew what kind of thing I wanted to research before I decided to apply for PhD programs, but that took a long time working a corporate job, to see the struggles, and see what draws my interest. I read, read, read after I knew my topic, not the opposite. Maybe you can find some place with hop topics in your field, see if there is something that seems feasible to you. \n\n\\- \"Make sure\" of anything is usually a problem during a PhD. The uncertainty is one of the hardest parts of the journey, in my experience. We are never sure, we're always researching, experimenting, but we're rarely sure about something. We keep going despite the uncertainties, despite the high probabilities of failure. Something that I heard from a professor once and I always repeat here: failure is the standard when you are a researcher. That's part of the nature of the job. And that wouldn't happen if we could make sure of the things we do. \n\n\\- Independence is very important. The advisor is there to advise you on what you are doing. Not necessarily to tell you what to do, teach you what to do, or anything like that. You do your work, show to the advisor, and then the advisor advises on the work you do.

I'm back in academia after years in industry, and it makes it hard for me to take many of them seriously as professionals sometimes. \n\nThat said, the exceptions are wonderful, curious, vivacious people I'm honored to know. Many of them have a life outside academia. Physician-scientists are particularly lovely, as are field researchers who have to spend time in the community.

Read up on the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) [doctoral funding](https://www.findaphd.com/funding/guides/ahrc-funding.aspx). That funding covers your tuition and provides a \u00a316k (rising with inflation, more in London) p/a stipend. The funding is distributed across ten regional research consortiums, each of which will provide funding to several universities in that region; they'll also have opportunities for you to apply for funding to attend conferences or travel to archives. In your position, you identify a department where you might like to study (for example because there are a couple staff working there whose expertise covers your proposed PhD topic), then you contact those academics to enquire about applying for a PhD, and if they want you as a doctoral student they'll guide you through the process of applying for AHRC funding.  \n\nUK universities also have a small number of their own PhD scholarships, which is what you'd apply for if you were an international student and not eligible for an AHRC funding scheme.\n\nBy all means explore PhD funding opportunities in continental Europe as well, but don't rule out the UK through a mistaken belief that you can't get funding in the UK. Yes, it's competitive, but if you put together a solid research proposal I'd have thought you would stand a good shot. \n\nI also know of quite a few people in the UK who were accepted onto a PhD programme but rejected from AHRC funding in the first instance, and then proceed with the PhD part-time for the first year while working on the side and re-applied for AHRC funding to commence in their second year, at which point they then switch to full-time. It seems like the acceptance rates for AHRC funding is much much higher in those situations -- probably because from the research consortium's point of view there's much less risk in investing money in a student who has already began their doctoral studies. Not ideal of course, but if you're dead-set on doing a PhD and don't get AHRC funding to begin with, it's an option.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/v1pji6/fully_funded_humanities_ma_and_phd_in_europe/ianux4e/"}, "6255": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "my_title_is_doctor", "Date": 1654005149, "Score": 1, "Body": "Why would you not recommend it?

Because of your long hiatus your situation is unique.\n\nYou have three options in my opinion:\n\n1) have a detailed discussion with your PhD advisor and talk to them about your new found motivation and drive to actually finish your PhD. Discuss with them options that will allow you to get back in the game and push forward. At the end of the day it is still their job to mentor you and guide you. \n\n2) if your advisor is an absent person ( and not because you did your own thing for literally 2 years) then get a co-advisor. If you get a new main advisor, you are basically starting over. You are essentially a second year (there's nothing wrong with that) so switching main advisors will mean changing overall tactics and approach to your research. If you worked on your PhD for four straight years then you would more or less be self sufficient by this point and could switch advisors because their job would be more administrative by that point and less scientific hand holding mentoring (they won't have to teach you much or help you develop the overall idea and concept of your dissertation).\n\nTry to find a co-advisor that works well with your advisor. That would eliminate the drama and stress of having to work with someone your advisor doesn't like. If you have to go with someone your advisor doesn't know or like then pick someone who is essentially a badass and really engaged with your students.\n\n3) the last option is to just keep working and forget the PhD all together. I typically tell people that if you NEED a PhD for your professional growth and goals AND/OR you are at least 3 years in your program then just do it. But it sounds like you are very successful without a PhD so you really don't have to do it. \n\nDisregard the last option if you know that is not what you want. I truly do not know your situation so I am only basing my answers off of what I read. \n\nI hope this all helps and please reach out if you want clarification on anything I said. \n\nGood luck\nDr. J", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/v0nadk/restart_my_phd_work_after_more_than_2_years_of/iao2cxe/"}, "6272": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "MinairenTaraa", "Date": 1654008592, "Score": 2, "Body": "I can totally understand you.

Funding bodies exercise discretion when there's a good applicant who happens not to have a distinction at MA -- it's not a hard and fast requirement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What do you think does make for a convincing candidate? I am thinking about publishing a philosophical article in the small journal that I work for, since I thought that might convince the funding bodies that I can produce writing. Or is their focus much more on the nature of the PhD project itself?\n\nIt's both, really. They want to see that you're proposing a project that is first of all achieveable and realistic (is it something you can reasonably complete within three and a half years and 80,000 words?) and secondly compelling and original (what would your proposed research project add to the scholarly field and contribute to existing knowledge?) You address these points in the \"research proposal\" section of your funding application. \n\nThere's a separate \"candidate\" (or something like that) section of the application, where if I recall right you discuss why you in particular are the right person to undertake the proposed project -- it's here where you would mention your editing work and any publication you might have. The very existence of that second section shows that the funding committees want to look beyond your degree grade to see you have the necessary enthusiasm and proven interest to do a PhD. \n\nWriting applications is difficult, in no small part because the word count is so small (I think it's 400 words for each section, I'd have to go back and check). The secret of writing good applications is that you identify and contact prospective PhD supervisors and explain to them what your research idea is, then they will hopefully take an interest in you and help you to read and edit your application drafts. It's also a really useful way of gauging whether an academic who happens to be working in the area you are interested in would actually make a good supervisor. If they are engaged in your application and offering lots of useful help and advice, returning your drafts swiftly, then chances are they will be a similar kind of supervisor.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/v1pji6/fully_funded_humanities_ma_and_phd_in_europe/iao43el/"}, "6276": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LanguidLandscape", "Date": 1654009545, "Score": 5, "Body": "Good lord, I\u2019d have offed myself if I had to drink that swill.

Thesis's I'd imagine are similar and most thesis defenses usually fall under the \"pass with revisions\" category. Only the top 10% of dissertations ever receive the \"pass with distinction\" honor and showcases superior quality. But that is the thing, a dissertation or thesis does not need to all be superior in quality to pass and at the end of the day, what do you care more about: (1) passing or (2) passing with some prestigious honor?

At the doctoral level, everyone is expected to pull an A-grade. At this level, GPA and grades in the greater scheme of things don't mean jack shit so why worry about it? Getting a 3.8 or 4.0 GPA at the undergraduate or Master's level would have held some weight, but at the doctoral level, again, the expectation is a 4.0 or A grade for all courses. Whether you get an A- or solid A grade shouldn't mean that much, you should just view coursework as \"survive and advance (to the next doctoral stepping stone).\" I'm sure you would agree, as a fellow doctoral student, we got too much other important shit (classes, conferences, publications, teaching, social/family obligations, research, dissertation writing, etc.) to worry about and not enough time in the day to worry about trivial things like a half letter grade, especially if you passed the course. \n2. If a professor of a respective course thinks your work is good enough to give you an A grade and pass you in regards to the course, why should you waste a single second second guessing your self? Literally, an expert in your field of interest and creator of the course itself thought your work satisfied the requirements of the course and viewed it as meeting the standard to give you passing marks. \n3. \"Busting my ass\" at this level (doctorate level) and especially as a future prospective professor is basically the price of admission to even enter this academic environment. Simply put, it's the norm, nothing special. I can totally empathize with your sentiment and feelings, but sometimes, our hard work isn't always reflected in the final product (grade or end goal). All you can do is maybe get some constructive feedback from professors or tutors on your areas of weakness and improve upon them. What you don't want to do is continually complain about it. The reason is you start coming off like those Freshman students who complain about deserving a higher grade and a sympathy vote when perhaps they have not truly earned it (though in their minds, they have).\n4. The other thing you have to keep in mind is unless you have developed a close relationship with your cohort mates and people at different points within your own doctoral program, you will never know the background of each cohort member. You have to remember that not only do we vary in age, but every person is at a different point in their academic journey when it comes to knowledge within your particular field, experience within the field, experience in teaching, researching, presenting at conferences, publications, etc. This may perhaps explain why some of your classmates get a higher grade than you or you deem them to be more of an expert or quote unquote \"a natural\" in some aspects of academia if compared to yourself. While you may be at the same level or point in a doctoral program as your classmates, other character traits may vary because everyone brings in a different level and degree of expertise when entering a doctoral program. Nothing to be ached of and instead of feeling insecure, you should learn from them, pick their brain, ask for their opinions on certain subject matter and likewise, offer your input in instances where you have more expertise than your peers. \n5. Lastly, I've said this before in other threads, but a doctorate program is very much a group effort as it is an individual one. You should be supporting and pushing each of your cohort mates to graduate and see out the doctoral program finish line as you are yourself. It's your cohort mates that offer you the specified emotional, physical, and psychological support that sometimes, your own family/friends from back home can't offer because your cohort mates can talk from personal experience. They know the pressures and stress of doing doctoral level work, writing specific dissertations chapters, and meeting deadlines related to coursework. The words of encouragement like: try your best, you can do it, and you got this do mean a lot coming from friends/family, but again, it sometimes falls on deaf ears because these individuals can't talk from experience of how being a doctoral student feels. Your cohort mates are an invaluable resource to surviving a doctoral program. This is why you shouldn't cause unnecessary division, problems, or unnecessarily alienate yourself from your cohort mates just because you feel insecure about yourself, your grade, and your cohort mates level of knowledge/ability if compared to your own.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/v1njj9/how_do_you_deal_with_comparison_stealing_your_joy/iaoynxx/"}, "6330": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Born-Mad", "Date": 1654022113, "Score": 2, "Body": "Well I'm in my last year, so quitting now would be stupid.

Had a presentation at a seminar, and was also nervous, and the presentation was a bit too short in the end...\n\nThe problem is that while I always practiced the talks the practice talks I gave at home were always a bit heartless. So I start talking and then when I start fumbling I stop, take some notes, etc. In the end, I may have \"practiced\" the talk two times or so, and also the timing was always screwed up because I was taking notes.\n\nSo this one talk at the seminar was a bit of a wake-up call for me. Also, I had another talk literally the next day. I was so pissed off that I then properly practiced the talk of the next day at home, five or six times or so. I also woke up earlier than usual and even practiced it once before going to the conference. And then the talk was much smoother and the timing was on point.\n\nSo this is my advice, basically: you need to practice more, way more. Take some notes on what you want to say and then start the timer. And then don't stop the timer when you're fumbling (I always did this...), instead just push through. And then do it another time, and then another time, and then another time. At one point you don't fumble anymore, and at that point, you notice that the presentation is too long or too short. Then you add/remove some slides, start again from the start, and so on.\n\nFor me at least this is the lesson I learned the hard way. :-D\n\nWhat also always helps me is to write down my opening sentence verbatim on the notes-section of the presentation slide. Even if it is something simple like \"Hello everyone, welcome to my presentation on my PhD project...\". This is always a good \"jump-start\" for me.\n\nEdit: I was like you also a bit down after my botched talk at the seminar. But I think that as  PhDs we are also still in a training phase, so in my opinion, it's perfectly normal to still suck at some things.
