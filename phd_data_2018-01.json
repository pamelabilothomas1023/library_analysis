To prepare yourself for your thesis, regular reports are part of the experience and they are not exactly the most exciting to do. Don't get me wrong, it's very necessary especially considering that your thesis is supposed to be huge, but it's no fun.\n\n2: No feedback. In your masters you received grades for courses and internships and reports and all that. That's gone now. Whether you do well means judging your own progress by yourself and also whatever reactions your supervisors may give you (which can be hard to read. They are people too). \n\n3: You're at the forefront of science. Your supervisor does not have all the answers. It's your research, your subject. That means that after all this YOU are supposed to be the expert.\n\n4: A LOT more literature. Since you are supposed to be the expert, you have to be up to date with everything related to the reactions you use, the fields your experiments are related to, etc. Of course, your supervisors read literature too and can forward some good things every now and then, but it's mostly up to you to read.\n\n5: Data organization becomes massively important. You won't just get spectra and reports. You need to organize literature, calculations, tables, etc. Your lab notebook needs to be meticulous because it's a legal document proving that you did this and that experiment at that time. Your data needs to be so organized that any one student can pick it up and continue where you left of with some instruction. (and they will, once you are done)\n\n6: Irregular schedule (at least in my case). You were used to go to uni 9-6 during the masters, but during the PhD what matters is that the work gets done. That means some days you'll stay 8-9, some other days 9-4. You'll quickly find out most supervisors do not care a lot about your number of hours. But don't waste what little time you have. \n\n7: The default state is that things won't work. This is research after all.\n\nI hope that helps you to be a little mentally prepared for what's to come. Of course it's not easy. It's not supposed to be. But a lot of people had no idea what they were getting into, especially in the US since they combine masters and PhD there and call it PhD.

That's an important first step so that your department knows what is going on. You said you have tried taking medication and didn't like it; have you tried weekly therapy to try and uncover what exactly makes you anxious and why that is?

This also gives you time to think briefly.\n\nIf youre in front of a table i sometimes sit on my hands to stop myself rapping my knuckles on the chair or table.\n\nUnless you are naturally funny dont include jokes or gags in your answers as nerves will just make them fall completely flat. I learned this the hard way.\n\nIf you have a shaky voice when speaking, say it to the panel before you start. I was told this piece of advice when i went for my first interview, i told the panel \"im a little bit nervous, sorry in advance if my voice starts to shake\", they were actually very understanding about it and that gave me a lot of confidence, it helped immensely as i wasnt worried about them finding out about me being nervous they already know that you are and its not a point against you, it shows that you want the position and arent just there for interview experience. \n\nRemember that the people interviewing you arent there to catch you out, no one likes to see someone struggle. They are just there to find the best candidate.\n\nMy best piece of advice is to practise your answers to your self out loud in front of the mirror. Your flatmates or family will think you are crazy but this is the best way to practise for public speaking as it allows you to work on your tone of voice, how fast you are speaking, and the content. When it comes to answering the question you wont have to think too much.

You've done incredible work but it's very common for all of us doing PhDs to start comparing ourselves to others and thinking we don't know as much as they do.\n\nSome practical things:\n\n1. Make a note of all the things that *have* gone well and keep them somewhere you can see it. Or at least look over it regularly. What you did in the first few months deserves to be written across the sky by a plane, because most people have still got no idea what they're doing in the first few months (I'm in the humanities, so my experience may be slightly different).\n\n2. Keep a *realistic* diary of what you expect to do every day. Taking breaks and spending time on your hobbies is GOOD, and HEALTHY. There's this idea in academia that the only way to succeed is to be obsessive and never take breaks and that's the quickest route to burnout.\n\n3. It might be useful to have a chat with your supervisor, or academic pastoral advisor (if you have one). Go over what you have achieved and what you can show when you do your presentation. It might be that what you imagine you have to produce and what they actually expect you to produce are two different things.\n\n4. Does your institution have a counselling service? Or is there somebody you can lay out your progress and ask if it's good or not. Sometimes having an external perspective to remind you that you don't have to save the world in the first month can be really helpful.\n\nFrom what I can read, it sounds like you've made incredible progress in the first year. You've published results, you've published updates to those results, it's okay if you publish fast to have to error correct.

Adapting to the small stipend of a student is hard even if you've lived frugally while working. I had saved quite a bit and lived well below my means while in industry, but still had to cut my lifestyle as a student. I felt bad spending my savings. \n\nBe prepared to have university faculty treat you like an undergrad even though you have gained experience working as a professional. There's a social hierarchy in academia and grad students are near the bottom.\n\nSometimes it takes a long time to get things done. Universities are more bureaucratic than private companies. When submitting journal papers, timelines for publication can span years. Contrast this to a software company where a release can be pushed out in weeks.\n\nDespite all that I'm happy I finished my Ph.D. I spent my first year as a full-time student, but after my first year I worked part-time to preserve my sanity. I enjoyed doing research and becoming an expert in my field. I did it mostly for the personal satisfaction and to prove to myself that I was capable of doing doctoral level work. I also wanted to open doors to do research professionally. \n\nYour future in academia will depend on your publication record. In technical fields, if you manage to publish a lot and are willing to do a post-doc you likely have a decent shot at a university faculty position. However, academia is tough. Despite the more flexible hours, you will likely have to work longer and harder than in a cushy Silicon Valley job at a big company.

If you can't pull your weight, they'll get rid of you; there's plenty more to take your place.\n\nGot it !\n\n&gt;  In the future, you might consider negotiating your contracts to permit publishing, at least under certain conditions. Someone with your salary has the necessary leverage to hold out for this.\n\nThat's the thing, I already did exactly that and now I am able to publish. Problem is I don't have any time to do so, and second thing is that even if I did it wouldn't be in the field I am interested in working on...\n\n&gt; Option 1. Read a shitton of papers in your field. Take notes. Organize them by notes. Look up concepts you don't understand. Draw yourself a graph of how all the topics of the different papers fit together. Then find a tiny topic that has a place in your graph but has no papers, and do the research and write a paper formatted exactly like the others you read. Submit to the same journal/conference. When it gets rejected, see if you got any useful reviewer notes, and otherwise politely ask someone in your field to point out flaws in your paper that should be fixed before you resubmit to another journal. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThat is part of the problem I have, I don't have any time to do this, I barely have a few hours at night to keep up with the field... I was hopping jumping on a phD program would give me that kind of time.\n\n&gt; Skim a bunch of papers until you find some you really like. Formulate 2-3 thoughtful questions per paper (e.g., \"Why did you demonstrate significance using metric X instead of metric Y?\"; \"I noticed you didn't reference this previous branch of work. How do you think your work fits in with it, or why did you consider it irrelevant?\"). Politely reach out to the first author of the paper you like and tell them you read their paper and really liked it but are new to the field and were hoping they'd answer a few questions. You are trying to get a conversation going with them. Their time is extremely valuable; be respectful. If you can build one of these relationships with a researcher geographically close to you, eventually maybe you can start doing unofficial research with them and helping them in their lab. This often leads to papers.\n\nThat's a really good advice.

I am not sure what each school offers, but off the top of my head there are many schools moving online.  Harvard extension, University of Penn, Penn State, University of North Dakota, Texas A&amp;M, Princeton, to name a few.  Look at schools you would normally look to for campus based degrees and you may find some online.  Of course there are some that really cannot be taught online and some that require longer residency.  I doubt you will find an enginerringg one online, but business degrees are often a good fit. Most schools will be offering some form of graduate degree online in the next 10 years.  It is simply too strong of a push to ignore.\n\nSo ignore the people putting down online degrees.  I doubt anyone will care if you got a degree online from MIT.  It is more about the school and if the topic can be taught using distance learning.  \n\nCost is something different.  If you are lucky enough to have someone else pay for your degree, you will be working it off.  They are not doing this out of the kindness of their hearts.  This is something every doctorate student should understand before they start the program.  You WILL work off the cost of the education, usually in research.  But, you will often be limited in topics as to what the school or your supervisor wants.  If you pay for your own way you will have more options for your research and often finish the degree faster since you are not working off your tuition.\n\nThere are definate advantages to having your way paid, but I have seen many people drop out from the stress or the fact that their supervisors keep holding them back so they can get more work out of the student.
