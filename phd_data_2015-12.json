So my first question would be: have you actually taking a class in rhetoric or speech?\n\nThink about it. You are making the assumption that public speaking is a natural skill like having good vision.  Certainly, there are people who seem naturally comfortable in front of an audience or seem to be naturally good storytellers. But for the rest of us public speaking is a skill set and so we have to practice and study hard to do it well. You have not, yes?\n\nIf you take a good public speaking class -- Typically offered in a speech communication or communication studies department  --  you will learn all sorts of ways to prepare for and execute a good speech. \n\nAnother point is that good speakers have different methods of achieving their talents. Obama is considered to be a very good public speaker but he is completely dependent on a Teleprompter. Other good public speakers are great at extemporaneous speech.\n\nYou may simply be one of those people who needs to refer to or read from notes.\n\nFinally, the Academy is one of the few places where introverts who are not great on social skills find a happy place to work.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_3vrv3y.json"}, "45": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lakewoodhiker", "Date": 1449950915, "Score": 1, "Body": "I would add a couple of motivational things...\nI just finished up late last year and walked in May.  I went through all of the same stages and emotional slumps described here...especially the imposter syndrome.  Despite obvious progress I was making in the lab, and in discussions with my advisor or committee, I wasn't publishing so felt like nothing was actually getting done.  (My university requires 3 publishable chapters...although at least 4 is recommended, but they don't have to be published to graduate). Anyhoo.  After finishing my Candidacy and Comprehensive exams, I no longer had any palpable milestones to shoot for other than graduation.  I was another ABD, and defending seemed so far away.  Don't despair though...There were two things that did it for me:\n\nI went to a graduation and watched my girlfriend (wife now) walk and be addressed as \"Doctor\" for the first time about a year before my defense.  I was obviously super happy for her, but I also sat there almost in tears.  I knew where I was with my work and watching her walk was an incredible motivator.  I sat there and told myself, \"I want that\",  I want to be walking across that stage just like her.  I want to be called Doctor\".  Later that night I recorded a video on my phone of myself saying something like \"you saw her walk today, and you know how bad you want that.  Stop fucking around, and get your damn work done\".  I watched that video anytime I was slacking off or procrastinating.  It worked surprisingly well.\n\nThe second thing that did it for me was actually setting my defense date.  As soon as my committee agreed on a date (about 3 and half months out), it was if I went into robot mode. I had a necessary milestone, a date.  For three months I barely slept, I wrote like a muthafucka, and I sent drafts back and forth with my advisor incessantly. I survived on ramen, coffee, and fruit loops, but I made it happen.  Nothing else mattered for those three months and I thankfully had a very understanding partner (who knew exactly what I was going through...from personal experience).  The final few months leading up to your defense will absolutely suck.  There is no other way to say it.  BUT....BUT....when you have that robe on and you walk across that stage....nothing feels like it in the world.  Nothing.\n\n\nI forgot to add, as far as \"losing that part of you\", don't worry to much about that.  You'll always have the memories and the experience, and something will get settled post graduation.  Whether it be a post-doc, or industry job, or tenure track faculty position, you'll figure something out and you'll be surprised at how excited you are about starting the next chapter.

At my university in Canada, an undergraduate honors degree means your degree is more concentrated in a particular area (you take more courses in a specific area and have fewer electives), and the minimum grade requirements are higher (70% instead of 60%, though in practice it's often higher than 70% because entry to the honors programs are sometimes competitive), compared to a non-honors degree.  In some departments a senior research project is required as part of the honors degree (it's often even called an honors thesis). Most of these things wouldn't apply to a PhD degree.  In a PhD there aren't levels of specialization.

I \ndid a PhD then went into the industry so I have some kind of view on both sides, so here's some points: \n\n**PhD**\n\n* Expensive for you, not a real money earner. If you're young and haven't bought a house/flat or whatever then this could be an important factor for you.\n* Greater hours of work. For a job maybe you work 8 hours a day, for a PhD in my case it was closer to perhaps 12 or so on average.\n- Can often be very solitary. If you like working with people, research can be quite isolating.\n- If you go into the industry, it may bear virtually no resemblance to what you end up doing and so give no real benefit other than experience of research (which might not necessarily be a bad thing).\n+ You'll probably get a salary boost when you go for your first job which is nice.\n+ Experience in the world of research, and opens up new options later on.\n\n**Job**\n\n+ Much greater salary.\n+ You get to work as a team.\n+ Greater experience if you go into a job straight away. This could certainly make the salary boost you'd get with a PhD immaterial, as you could easily be on the same pay anyway.\n+ More personal time.\n+ Less stress.\n\nAn extra point on the difficulty level though, a PhD is probably **much** harder than a job. You're basically at the front-line of human knowledge, which means sometimes you don't get to ask anyone for help, because no-one knows the answers you're looking for. There's no hand-holding either.\n\nA PhD is really a very challenging undertaking, and you should seriously consider the implications of taking up this degree.
