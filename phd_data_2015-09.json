I know you're probably just venting right now and you just really want someone to empathize with you.  I'll be the one to tell you that you're not a dick and you're not insane for your perception.

THIS is what is deserving of a PhD.  Not what those glorified lab-techs are doing working on simply completing the aims of an already funded project and getting their hand held along the way.   Pat yourself on the back for that.  The adversity you had to overcome is undoubtably going to help you out in the future and you will likely soon come to appreciate the struggle you went through, although I understand it was a painful process.  But now you have the neuronal tracks established in your mind on how to do research from beginning to end.  \n\nWith regards to training the new student, let me remind you that information is a commodity in our field.  Knowledge is the currency of us PhDs.  So don't just blab away all your thought processes to this new guy.  But help him out a little.  Nobody wants to hold the guilt of being perceived as a dick who doesn't help anybody out.  Share with him the scientific facts, but let him figure out the process of connecting the dots on his own.  Honestly, it will be more  worthwhile to him.  If he succeeds with your project when you're gone, it means he busted his ass and is deserving of a PhD/decent paper.  If not, well, then he just wasn't meant to be a researcher. \n\nBy keeping these afformentioned things in mind, I am now more willing to help my labmates out.  They will appreciate it, too, and it will likely lead to a coauthor paper in the future.  Research is a game; play your hand wisely and don't show your entire hand.  Be strategic, but maintain decency.  This will ensure that people will want to work with you in the future because ultimately this is a collaborative field and it's a necessity to succeed.

Make your intentions known. (Yes, some people will tell you it's a bad idea. Welcome to being a young person with career ambitions.) Talk to your professors and TAs (especially your favorite ones), and ask them for advice. Get involved with other people who are pursuing graduate school as well.\n\n2. Take your term papers seriously. One of these may serve as your writing sample.\n\n3. See if you can do research. Often times you can do an honor thesis, or your school might have an undergraduate research symposium or journal.\n\n4. Figure out what you might want to study in graduate school. This is the hardest part, and I'm still in this phase. If you have to take classes as a non-degree seeking students for a little while, so be it. This is what will really set you apart from other candidates, as a lot of people straight out of college don't know what they want to study and just apply. Lots of people want to study gender and lots of people want to study Jane Austen. If you just want to read lots of books consider getting an MA. Part of getting a PhD is contributing a new perspective, and that's tough work. But if you can show the faculty at the school of your dreams that you know what you want to do, and more specifically, you know how their research, expertise, and resources can aid you in this pursuit, you have a much better chance of getting in. \n\n5. Don't pay for your PhD. \n\n6. Don't let negativity get you down. A lot of people in academia are jaded (and pretentious). People in other disciplines will snub their noses at you. But lots of other people will help you develop your mind and spirit. Do what you love and be realistic about your career options.

Short version is, I did a 5 combined mechanical engineering / computer science degree which, for various reasons took 8 years to complete, but I finished with about 4 years of industrial experience.  5 + 4 = 8. Win. I then spent some time working in a good job in the finance sector, R&amp;D role, very technical, great company, good pay. Sounds perfect, but I got bored and wanted to move to greener pastures. Similar story. I always toyed with the idea of doing a PhD so I packed up life in Oz and moved the the UK. I'm now 3.75 years in to a 4 year PhD. Trying desperately to finish. Some things that occurred to me along the way that may or may not be helpful to you. \n\n1) Typically speaking, having a PhD limits your job prospects afterwards, it does not expand them. The vast majority of jobs (outside of academia) require a bachelors or masters degree.\n\n2) In then end, with a PhD, you'll end up being paid by advertising (google, facebook etc), big pharma/medicine, finance or military. Those are the places that have the money and care about really pushing boundaries. Everyone else will wait around for the new advances to come. \n\n3) Academia is a giant Pyramid Selling scheme. Proffs need a certain number of Snr Lecturers to get by, Snr Lecturers need a certain number of Lecturers to get by, Lecturers need a certain number of PostDocs to get by, PostDocs need a certain number of PhD's to get by and so on. Most lectureships are 20:1 over subscribed by PostDocs which are probably 10:1 oversubscribed by PhD students. That means you have 200:1 shot at a lectureship. Not good odds. \n\n4) Going directly into an industrial position will save you time and money. In my field, I could be earning $100-200K if I worked at any one of the big 4. This value really doesn't change much if you have a PhD or not and the 4+ years you spend on to get a slightly more senior role could have been done in ~= 2 years if you'd stuck around in industry. This means you'll waste 4x$150K - $0*+ 2 years on doing the PhD. Not much incentive. *$0 = approximate income of a PhD\n\n5) Before you start on the PhD path, you need to ask yourself, \"why?\". \"why should I do a PhD and what good will it bring me\". Perhaps read the book \"A PhD is not enough\" (http://sceomasincukraljevo.blog.com/files/2011/04/di-0356.pdf, http://www.amazon.com/PhD-Is-Not-Enough-Survival/dp/0465022227). So, the question is, what good will the PhD qualification give you that you wouldn't otherwise have. For me, I want to teach, at a university level. There's just no way to do that without a PhD. I feel that teaching and inspiring new students, moving the best knowledge that we have into the best minds that we have so that we can develop more good knowledge and maybe I can add a little bit to our pool of knowledge as I go is that best thing that I can do for us all humans everywhere for all time. You know, so that my short time on this planet isn't too wasted. I'm also delusional, so your priorities may vary. But for me, there just is no other pathway to what I want to do than having a PhD. \n\n6) Doing a PhD is a lot of fun. You get nearly complete freedom to pick and choose your direction and your research. To choose interesting paths and directions which you just can't do in industry. It's awesome. \n\n7) It's also a hell of a lot of work. You'll be \"paid\" less than minimum wage to work 40-90hrs a week and for the entirety of the PhD period you'll have a growing weight on your shoulders about finishing. \n\n8) One other thing that surprised me is that I spend about 50% of my time on marketing and advertising. Yes that right, I have to market myself and my research to the community so that they will accept my ideas/publications in the future. This means going to conferences at exotic locations (fun - I've traveled from Hong Kong to Helsinki, Bordeaux to San Francisco, all on other peoples money) but also gruelling (typical conference hours for me are 7:30am to 1:30am for 5-6 days) and preparing slide deck after slide deck, presentation after presentation and poster after poster (really boring). \n\n9) If you are headed for the BioTech industry you might want to look at/consider Cambridge. With Astrazeneca moving here there are tons of BioTech startups all around here hoping to get acquired. One of the great things about Cambridge is that (subject to your funding arrangement) you get to own any IP that you generate and if you play your cards right, doing a PhD can also be a good place to start the ideas that will form your company. Cambridge is also at an advantage in this regard because there is a lot of start-up funding around for that sort of thing. \n\n10) Finally, as a mature student with a bunch of industrial experience you will find the PhD experience very different to those coming straight out of a masters. On the one hand, you will be treated like a child again, and a lot of the things you take for granted (like having house contents insurance) become hard/impossible/really really annoying. On the other, you'll be faster, more efficient and more disciplined with more realistic goals and motivations. Lots of recent undergrads/master students find it hard to \"come to the office\" from 9-5 (ok realistically 10-8pm) whereas you will not. You will also be in a great position to win prizes and awards simply by having a little more experience in working and presenting your work, and you will do work that is more applicable to industry so it will be more \"relevant\" with more possible \"tech transfer\" which universities and funding grants like. \n\nSo yeah, think hard about if you want to do it and why and if you do, there are good things and bad things, things that will make your life/career better and things that will make it worse. \n\nTL;DR - it depends.  \n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_3jrkh5.json"}, "25": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "mgrosvenor", "Date": "1441558304", "Score": 0, "Body": "(3) is a lie.

Instead of a vague list, it would be nice to have a click-type interface like the results section, with different job types broken down by category. \n\nThis is the beta, I guess, so I'm not disappointed that the \"Resources\" section is so sparse, but if I paid for this I would be pissed. \n\nThe \"Events\" section is huge, though, and full of what looks to be good info, but it's hidden under those other sections that are mostly links to powerpoints and AMAs. I would put those webinars somewhere a little more prominant. \n\nIn these AMAs you keep claiming that your motivation here is to get people into sweet jobs, or whatever, but this is just in no way credible. It would help adoption a lot if you were upfront about your business plan. Are you harvesting contacts of highly educated people? Will you have a long free beta to drive adoption and then charge for a premium account or something? Will you keep the site free, but try to sell advanced resume services? Are you charging companies to better their search rankings? I signed up with a fake name and a junk email becuase it's not clear to me what kind of business you're running here. I hope that most trained scientists are fairly skeptical of silicon valley types hyping their urgent need to help humanity.

That doesn't mean you can't treat this like a 40 or 50 hour a week job. It will depend a lot on what stage of the program you're at.  Your personal relationships will change. Some might get destroyed but you'll make new ones, so don't sweat it too much.\n\n2) If you don't want to go to academia I really don't see why you'd do a phd, but the job market is changing and there's definitely plenty of applied science jobs in industry that would value a phd. I think some of the concerns that you'll be over-qualified for industry are a bit out-dated and companies, especially those with lots of resources, are willing to hire experts of the highest level.\n\n3) If you don't like the project at hand why not just change your focus towards something you're interested in? I don't know how much freedom you would have, but in my area it is quite common to hear people changing gears based on their new experiences at the phd level, their research, and their interests. \n\nTalk to your supervisor and see what they have to say.
