If your supervisor sends you emails at midnight, unless they just run late to late (they don't get up until late morning but work until late evening), yeah. Don't go there. \n\n**Project Advice**\n\n1. If there is a project that is OBVIOUSLY MORE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE than the others, pick it. Immediately. Without hesitation.

Also, batch cooking helps with your budgeting, which is...extremely fun in London, from what I remember of living there.\n\n4. Your PhD is a very emotionally intense time of your life and it only gets worse as you get towards the end, so make sure that you have a good support network around you by the end of your 1st year. Family, friends, whoever, even a counsellor or a therapist, YOU ARE GOING TO NEED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE STAYING ON TRACK.\n\n5. If you find yourself working WAY more than regular office hours, consider scaling back and/or forcing yourself to leave work at a decent time (say, 6-7pm) every day so you don't go completely nuts. Try to work more efficiently, not more hours. That's a mistake that virtually everyone makes and if you're not careful, you could end up in the middle of a dick-measuring context among the student body over who can work the most hours...\n\n...speaking of the student body...\n\n**Other Students**\n\n1. Your social life, unless you join a society or have some pretty solid hobbies/friends outside your PhD anyway, will likely revolve around hanging out with the other students. This means that unless you put in a LOT of effort to talk to people or are part of a good work group (TRY TO GET YOURSELF IN ONE OF THESE!), you'll probably end up in a massive lonely-stressed-work-lonely circlejerk along with everyone else. My advice? Get yourself a good life outside your PhD, so that you don't have to rely too much on your co-workers. They're alright, and you might get a best friend out of it or something, but really...most people are assholes, and your co-workers are no exception to this rule.\n\n2. As a female in STEM...who was in an LTR when she entered the PhD and no longer is...yeah, date within the department at your own risk. It's probably more trouble than it's worth. In London, whatever you're looking for, you're probably better off on Tinder...\n\n3. Among the students, there WILL be an established social order.

Don't be afraid to meet new people when you do find that hobby. You're a psychology major so you probably already know the psychology behind a lonely mind, so I won't talk about that much. However there are some other reasons that are important, and I will summarize them in the following points.\n\n* Isolation in your home for *long* periods of time is unhealthy for your mental health. I am the same way, and so is everyone else. We are social creatures that need a sense of \"community\" for their well-being. Writing for 8-10 hours at home needs to be balanced out with being around people, and having positive social interactions with them. Even just sitting in a local park or coffee shop will make you feel more connected and less alone. \n\n* Exercise is a great way to meet people. It is also healthy for your mental health. Whether it is rock climbing, yoga, swimming, hiking, jogging, it doesn't matter. You can use apps like Meetup to find local gatherings, or go into your local gym and ask about any workout group meetups. \n\n* Something that is intellectually stimulating and will take your mind away from your work is important to have too. I find that my work is at its best when I can stretch another part of my brain in a different aspect in my life. For example, I like to read-up on current affairs to take my mind away from my work. I also like to cook and try new healthier recipes after reading up on them or watching youtube videos on cooking. \n\n* Loneliness is a state of mind. It can be changed by getting a deep sense of connection to the world around you, primarily by having positive experiences with other people. The solution is easy, but hard in application. Meeting new people is often intimidating, but everyone is lonely and just remember that there is another person out there feeling the same way you do when you feel alone.\n\nIt will be okay!

It may sound broad, but if you can do that, within those papers, you will also be teasing out some aspects of questions you may actually get on the exam.\n\nMy PhD was also in the social sciences, I had two 8 hour written (typed papers) exams. I felt unprepared all the way into the exam room, it felt like this could make or break everything I have worked so hard for. I felt like that would be the dreaded moment I had been so scared of, when I would fail and everyone would realize I didn't have what it takes to succeed. \n\nBut once I got to the exam, read the prompts, all the content from the practice essays I wrote came flooding in, I passed, and moved on.\n\nIn retrospect, studying for that exam was actually a great time. Minus the anxiety, I had a chance to delve into literature that I am super passionate about. I became an expert, and that feels good.\n\nBreath, take short breaks, and try to remember that you truly care about the subject. You have taken so many classes on these topics. Review your old notes, read over past book reviews, read old papers you submitted. This will help spark your confidence that you know more than you think already. You just need to practice and fill in any gaps.\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6s77bw.json"}, "202": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "alphanumericsheeppig", "Date": 1502193528, "Score": 1, "Body": "If you get a puppy, it can't possibly turn out bad. \n\nThere are lots of PhD horror stories out there, but remember people are more likely to be vocal when things seem bad.

This means that whilst in your masters it would have been say normal to pick a question from a catalogue of projects, grab whatever stimuli and materials where needed, and then put together a design, implementation and analysis... at PhD you will have to do the full shebang of proposing the project, doing all the pre-reading to justify it etc, create the stimuli, delivery programmes etc and all the rest.\n\nIn my MSc there is no way I could have learnt acoustics, MatLab, experimental design, statistics, data management, project writing, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.

I can't speak to the specific details of your application, but I will advise:\n\nAmerican PhD programs sometimes struggle with admitting Indian PhD students who have a hard time adjusting to the academic culture in America, or American culture in general.  These bad experiences make the PhD program more hesitant to admit Indian students in the future, which means if they do decide to admit an Indian student, that student needs to have an incredibly stellar application.  \n\nBut this is a fixable problem.  Assuming you are already familiar with American academic and general culture and have spent time there, or at least spent time studying/working in Western Europe, what you need to do is establish face-to-face professional relationships with professors at the universities where you are applying for your PhD.  Find some way to strike up a collaboration with the target US professor from your Indian university, and communicate via Skype calls, and if at all possible, travel there to see them as part of the collaboration.  Or attend conferences and build a relationship with your targetted professor there.  Once they know you and can see that you are well-adjusted to the culture and that you are easy to work with, you'll be a top-competitive applicant.  \n\nSo, maybe you won't have any problems with this round of admissions.

I suggest a different method.  Working on your PhD means reading lots and lots of research papers in your field, and you need to know how to do this ahead of time to be effective during your PhD.  So go ahead now and start reading a few hundred papers.  (If this is too scary, then at least read the title, abstract, and Introduction.)  During each paper, take notes: a few keywords about the paper, a 2 sentence summary in your own words, and any questions you have about either background material or methods/findings in the paper.  Occasionally, you will find a really good paper that you really like, and you want to work on this topic and write papers just like this one.  (If you don't find such papers, it's a red flag that you are pursuing the wrong subject!)  Look at the list of authors.  The last author is often the professor running the lab, and if this lab is in a country you'd consider doing your PhD, then look up the lab and find out about it.  If you like the projects they work on and the culture looks reasonable, then politely write an email to the professor, asking a couple of your most intelligent questions about the paper.  Try to strike up an email conversation, and if it goes well, mention that you would like to do a PhD on this topic, and ask if they know of any labs taking students.  Maybe they just received some new funding and would encourage you to apply, or maybe they know of a good lab of their colleague, or maybe they will recommend you strengthen your background or look elsewhere.  Alternatively, strike up conversations with professors at conferences.  Also: Rankings almost don't matter at the PhD level.  That's an undergrad thing.  Young professors routinely start at low-ranked schools, and then get cherry-picked to work at prestigious school; so pick the professor, not the school.\n\n2. I don't understand the question.  You can go back for a PhD at any time in your career, even after you've worked at a company.  Also, it's fine to work on a university project sponsored by a company.\n\n3. In some countries you take standardized tests; in others, you don't.  In the US, it's probably the GRE test, which is reading, writing, and math skills.\n\n4. This varies by country, but generally, as long as you spend at least 3 years or so working on a project(s) during your PhD, you can count that as work experience.  It's easier to count teaching and research work as work experience, and harder to count fellowships, which are free money with no work requirement.  But also, consider the jobs you are aiming at afterwards: if you spent 6 years working on research while doing your PhD and a company is backward enough to be trying to hire you afterwards as \"no working experience\", then go work elsewhere, they aren't worth your time :)\n\n5. 'Fully funded' means you pay no tuition and you are given a small monthly paycheck (probably similar to minimum wage in that particular country) to cover your living expenses.  It may even mean that you have a travel allowance for attending conferences, and a materials allowance for new equipment.  No, not all students receive a stipend (just like not all jobs pay good salaries); it depends on the country and university and lab and how good is the professor at bringing in research funding.

Which seems like a somewhat arbitrary distinction but in psychology (and many fields) knowing how to A) Ask a question and B) How it will hypothetically answer it, is a huge part of the job.\n\nWhile most of the real world operates on a system of:\n1) What is the problem/question\n\n2) Then how do I answer it?\n\n3) What answer did I get.\n\nYou'll find you often need to design 1 and 2, already thinking about what 3 will be. I'm sure you'll be fine with it, but for some people it's very counter intuitive, but to have worked in robotics I would assume that creative problem solving is something you've had to do fairly often and that's really what this ends up being.\n\ntl;dr. I'm sure you'll be fine. You're entering the field at a really exciting time for very computer literate people and those with a good grasp of more engineering based topics. There'll be difficulties but these are mostly going to be centred in theoretical areas rather than practical and can be caught up on.\n\nIf you have any specific questions regards the exact research you are interested in, and what sort of base \"Shoudl everyone know this?\" let me know!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6vgpml.json"}, "537": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Huwbacca", "Date": 1503486867, "Score": 1, "Body": "1) depends.

Where I tell my husband that I'm just going to get through this deadline and then quit because it's too much and I don't need it for my career. Then the deadline passes, the pressure ends, and I'm looking out for new opportunities that have ridiculous deadlines. \n\nI'm a total achiever type person. When I work out, for example, I bitch and whine and huff and puff and wonder why the hell I'm doing this and then suddenly the session is over and I feel great and can't wait to go again. When I was in labour I told my husband that I couldn't cope, I wanted all the drugs, and then my baby was born and I was wondering when I could safely fall pregnant again to go through labour. A PhD is the same thing. There are challenging times but fuck I love it. I'd be devastated if I had to drop out.\n\nBabies. I won't lie, it's not easy. My department is super flexible, I don't have lab hours, I work from home. My son was 2 when I began, and I fell pregnant maybe 3 months into it. I just do it part-time and realise that some deadlines are very flexible. For example, I took 12 months maternity leave (common in Australia, esp for a part-time student). I was sick as a dog with a toddler during the pregnancy so I barely achieved anything, then in my annual summary I just detailed why progress was slow, and my supervisor signed it, and I was approved to continue. Then during my maternity leave I did what I could do catch up, especially when baby was a bit older. \n\nI don't know much about history but I imagine that it isn't really a race to finish - technology won't be outdated by the end, it's not a field where many faculties are trying to solve a major problem so you need to go hell for leather etc - so dropping down to part-time and taking maternity leave shouldn't be a problem. Having said that .. I am very lucky in that my two main supervisors are both mothers. One has children the same ages as my ones, and the other is very high up and has late teens and remembers what it was like when hers were young. Almost every other staff member in my department has children. So everyone is totally understanding and sympathetic. If I say \"my baby has gastro\" then I'm told to take a week off and rest. If I say \"my kid just won't sleep\" they remember those days and don't pressure. If I can't make a meeting because I can't get a babysitter it's no big deal. So I would suggest that finding supervisors or departments who are understanding of a studying academic with a young family is so important. Their support from that perspective makes all the difference. I would hate to be surrounded by supervisors and staff who just don't understand that when my kid has gastro, I'm getting no work done, and expect deadlines to still be met.\n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6vzj3p.json"}, "637": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Vdags2017", "Date": 1503839587, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank you ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6w8571.json"}, "638": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TheBelleOfTheBrawl", "Date": 1503868219, "Score": 1, "Body": "On the other hand, having a suggestion/query about a study during interviews shows critical thinking skills.

Now that I can see it will be over in 1 months time, I feel I will have such a heavy weight off my shoulders and can breath a sign of relief, regardless of if I pass this PhD or not. My top advice would be that life is precious and don't waste your time on something you have no interest/inclination to pursue after the PhD...at the end of the day it's the size of your bank account and not fancy titles which have value in society (unless your PhD is revolutionary and changes the world we live in for the better, which is unlikely).

I never really felt comfortable in coursework. I always felt like I was catching up, and was never satisfied with my understanding of what I was studying. The only reason I managed to get the grades I needed to be accepted for a PhD was because I pushed myself to the absolute limit. Then I started it, and it was really fun. Reading research for hours and hours until the topic started to make sense to me, and spending days scribbling in a notebook trying to find create ways to solve the problems I was looking at, then testing out my ideas and seeing that they worked, writing up my results and tweaking my manuscripts until I thought they were close to perfect. My PhD was fun and felt pretty laid back, and I gained a huge amount of confidence about my knowledge of the topic, and my ability to tackle tough problems in general.\n\nI think the most suited personality is someone who can be kind of obsessive and single minded. If you're the type of person who can bore your friends to death with detailed descriptions of whatever the latest thing you're interested in is, then you'll probably be well suited to a PhD. If you're the type of person who can lock yourself in a room and practice a scale on your guitar for seven hours straight, then you're probably well suited to a PhD. If you're the type of person who can start a difficult hobby on a whim and still be improving three or four years later, then you're probably well suited to a PhD\n\n&gt;I guess another concern I have is that when I think PhD, I think near genius.\n\nAs you know, this concern is unfounded. Most people who do a PhD are just regular people with a high-ish intelligence who are willing to put in the effort and have the right type of personality for it. If you're getting good grades and think you can apply yourself, this isn't anything to worry about.\n\n&gt;I'm generally not a math person, and I know research is about more than the formulas, but if I'm not comfortable with numerical data, how can I ever be successful in research?\n\nI really can't answer this. Mathematical skill were an absolute necessity for my field (theoretical physics). Any science is going to require some analytical skills, but I don't get the impression that social sciences in general require much more than elementary statistics in terms of formal mathematical skills.\n\nYou will also find that you learn things as you go. As long as you have the right type of personality for research, it is much easier to learn how to use a tool (e.g., a mathematical skill) when it is directly applicable to a concrete problem you are trying to solve, than it is if you are just trying to get a good grade in a course. Most of the techniques (analytical, numerical, and computational) that I was using with confidence towards the end of my PhD, I had never even heard of when I started, and I'm not someone who picked up these sort of skills quickly when it was for coursework.\n\nEDIT: I should also point out that it helps if you're not someone who relies on having a social life too much. Being very introverted (as I am) can be detrimental in a lot of ways, because it can be hard to make contacts and collaborate with colleagues, but it has the upside of meaning that I didn't have a lot of distractions in my personal life. I started later than a lot of people; I was about 30 when I actually started my PhD. I had done all my partying in my late teens and early twenties, and had lost contact with a lot of the friends I had in high school. I didn't have people calling me up all the time inviting me to things, and even if I did I probably wouldn't have been that interested. Most of my social contact outside of uni was with my girlfriend whom I live with, and it was easy to just shut the door and work on things if I needed to focus. If you're the sort of person who need to spend Friday nights with the lads to unwind after the week, and then go out on Saturday and take it easy on Sunday, I can imagine it could be very disruptive while you're in the middle of working on solving a problem.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6x58si.json"}, "700": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "iamjacobsparticus", "Date": 1504188312, "Score": 4, "Body": "See what readings you'd do in your field.
