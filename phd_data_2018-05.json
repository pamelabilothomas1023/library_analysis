You're Jami Smith, it's so good to finally meet you!\n\n**Researcher**: [returns handshake, smiling pleasantly]\n\n**You**: I'm very interested in your research on [topic X], that you did with [group ABC or collaborators ABC].  I read your paper [title here], and I thought it was so cool that you approached [quick description of research task] with [neat solution you genuinely liked]!  Ever since [other researcher] has been using [traditional method], I really wasn't sure how there would be new progress on [topic X], due to [drawbacks].  Now tell me, are you continuing more work in that direction?!?\n\n**Researcher**: Well, the NSF grant on [topic X] is winding down, and [grad student] just graduated, but we just got seed funding for [topic Xa] last month.  The idea is to collaborate with [group D and group E] to apply our solution from [our other paper] to [topic X].\n\n**You**: Ooh, that could be interesting!  You could try [applying solution from different paper to topic X], which makes sense because of [common sense reason, or an experience you had].

I've been meaning to take a shot at that, but I haven't gotten around to it.  I figure a good approach is [approach A].\n\n[sometime around now, hopefully researcher starts quizzing you about your experiences with your previous research, and if they have funding and they like what they hear, they will start gearing up to offer you a position.  And in case it's not obvious: Make sure you are prepared to chat with anyone you might be asked to interview with at the new group.]\n\nPS- A few other tips:\n\n* Keep publishing, regardless of your affiliation.  If you need tools only available at an institution, then make friends with a research group with access to those tools, and eventually maybe they'll do you a favor and give you limited access to the tools to run your experiments.  Professors are only really interested in talking to people with a current publication record.\n\n* Go to conferences/events and chat with as many researchers as possible.  Very few good PhD positions get filled with an applicant nobody's ever heard of before; they usually get filled with a colleague of a colleague or someone that people know (at least from a few chats at conferences).  So go meet lots of people.\n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/8h7rm9/struggling_to_be_accepted_into_a_programme/dyi5n10/"}, "116": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PhD_in_UK", "Date": 1525551099, "Score": 1, "Body": "I have to say this was a bit creepy\ud83d\ude04.

Just focus on getting the most basic information at this stage and not finding out every piece of information. Get one to two big names that you know have done some work in the field, download their papers and read who they cite in their intro. This will help you get a collection of names for who is in the field currently.\n\nStart to go through their archives and then understand from the earliest to the most recent what the field has been doing. Did someone post a paper 10-20 years ago and then there was a reply, an argument and the field decided one of right. These thesis-antithesis arguments form the basis of academic work so understanding the relevant ones for your field is good.\n\nAs for what journals and what people - that is down to your supervisor to help if you don\u2019t know. If you are at the point of not knowing any names or units in the field then be honest and let others in your department teach you.

This ended up being for the best, not only do I get along much better with my current cohort, but because I had to say out loud \u201cI failed a class,\u201d and be open about it, the shame went away. Since then I\u2019ve made it my business to talk to classmates this happened to later on (small phd cohort (9), huge psyd cohort (100)). I wasn\u2019t the only one who failed that class; I just was the only one who took time off and ended up in a totally new year. It happened to 3 of us PhDs, and over the last four years I know at least 20 other student who\u2019ve been held back for getting a C or for failing to meet certain deadlines.

I already did my extra year, but my program loves to hold people back arbitrarily, and apparently I am \u201cbehind\u201d on something not due for another six weeks. If that happens, it means I will be able to take a step back, but it\u2019s still a phd program, they don\u2019t ever stop being rigorous.

If you're being persistent about responding and getting no feedback what so ever, you can try to find a lab director for these labs who might be able to coordinate the professor. This is usually either a member of non-technical staff employed by the lab or a senior PhD student.\n \n2. Reach out to affiliated albeit smaller researchers. This includes PhD candidates in the lab, postdocs, or younger professors in the same department or university that may have less total exposure, but are still doing relevant research or have worked on projects with your main target. \n\nAs an anecdote from my personal experience: When I applied to graduate programs the first time around I had a really poor understanding of the inner workings of the system. As a result, I felt insecure and uncomfortable persistently contacting professors and didn't get accepted to any of the programs I applied to. In my second pass, I applied more broadly, and when I was rejected from my very average undergraduate university for the PhD program (despite having graduated very much at the top of their engineering schools class the year prior) I confided to a co-worker (who had been part of a PhD program at CalTech before mastering out to go work) that I felt a little dejected by the process. \n&gt; Co-worker: \"Well, how many times did you e-mail the professors?\"\nMe: \"A few, but none of them responded.\" \nCo-worker: \"Go back and keep emailing them or their grad-students until somebody explicitly tells you to stop.\"\n\nA week later I was face-to-face with a professor, who told me he wished I had reached out to him sooner so that we could have gotten all of the logistics of getting me accepted faster. Another professor that I met with at the same university was upset to find out I had already accepted an RA-ship from the previous one. \n\nAlso look into different departments. Off the top of my head, there is fascinating research (and researchers) in Deep-Learning, in Robotics, EE, Math, Cognitive Science, Psychology, Neuroscience, etc. All of them are a little bit different in flavor, but you can often find a space for yourself to operate within those departments, and still develop the research topics you are interested in.\n\nFinally, may I offer a bit of philosophical advice on the topic? Often times many people go into the PhD with the mentality that this is the work that defines who you are as a researcher and (in my opinion) wrongly believe that this is going to be the most important research they will ever do in their life. This makes no sense to me, even if you have research experience the PhD process is supposed to be about developing the skills that will let you get started doing meaningful research. So my approach to the process would be to formulate a desired topic specifically enough that you could point to papers that catch your attention, but broadly enough that it isn't a \"one-and-done\" research question. Find researchers that are making consistent and relevant progress in this field, and get a cracking at those emails.\n\nHope this helped, feel free to reach out if you need anything else, or just somebody understanding to listen.

I am french so I will talk about France and England in regard of PhDs (and other countries from what I\u2019ve heard from other students).\nI will also talk about my field which is engineering (robotics), which might be different from you too.\n\nIn France, it was not well seen to do a PhD and work after because it was common thinking that researchers don\u2019t have practical knowledge and only theoretical knowledge. Now it seems to change because a big part of the salary of a researcher is given to the company by the government (some years ago, some people even had to hide in their CV that they did a PhD to be taken into companies). In France (I suppose other countries do that too) you can have a CIFRE thesis (a PhD in the industry) which is most of the time a permanent job in a company that gives you a PhD. You would work in the R&amp;D department. So I would say having a PhD doesn\u2019t affect much your job career now (at least in France). But a PhD doesn\u2019t help you get a better job career either in France.\n\nIn England, it seems quite different. It seems that a PhD degree is really not useful if you need to work in a company.
