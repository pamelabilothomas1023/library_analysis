Your University should have a graduate handbook that outlines transfer credit requirements on their site that should come up in Google. There should also be a PhD handbook that outlines stricter guidelines. For instance\n\nI knew when I left Super Racist Southern University (pseudonym) for Northern but still Racist University (pseudonym) I knew from the NbsRU handbook that they'd only take 30 credits transferred from masters and 12 from PhD. I had multiple conversations with the associate Dean for curriculum for the school my department was in. It's literally one form with two signatures.\n\nWhen I switched from Concentration A to Concentration B it was easier because same department same faculty. But as long as you are within the same school and aren't doing something like going from fine arts to natural sciences this is a very simple process.\n\nAs far as politics go, faculty are transient. Most of them don't want to stay where they are. And frankly, they don't think as much about us as we do them. Prioritize your happiness because you can't prioritize your career without happiness. If you're frustrated now imagine how much worse it will be when you're trying to file paper work for defending and passing milestones. The situation you're in is know toxic than you can know at this point I promise you. Been in grad school for a decade and I know a lot of people. Everywhere sucks.

It's the end of you and these [jokers]\" - Jojo no Siwa \n\nP.S. there is no such thing as transferring PhD programs. There is only dropping out after you apply elsewhere and secure a spot and start over with or without a small headstart from what's really just a glorified AP credit for 30 somethings. Your departure will say far more about the place you leave than you. Most of the time it'll confirm what folks in your field, within your school, and at your national conference circuit already suspect. Everyone knows my old uni it's dog shit. You will never be the only person making an Exodus. \n\nAlso, don't forget to negotiate stipends and health insurance coverage. The only reason I'd stay somewhere I don't like is if the hearth insurance and the University hospital system were better than everywhere else I could go and/or if leaving would drop me even further below a living wage.

Plus, it would open the door for discussion about whether a phd could be considered a job that is paid at least a living wage; rather than the stipend system that currently is implemented, which can be withheld from the student and makes it impossible for phds to get a mortgage amongst other things. Also on top of that the pensions will effect phds looking to start in academia the most. Since what has been saved already will be untouched and it will only be a cut henceforth. So if we wanted to get into academia it is in our best interests to support the action. Lastly the workload on supervisors has been so much higher due to covid, and as lines between work and home life become increasingly blurred. the action is looking to reassess the contracted hours they\u2019re expected to work. Happier supervisors means better learning experience, which does have effects at our level (Sorry quite passionate about that, but gives perspective as to why it\u2019s a source of my stress)\n\nI want to thank you again for adding to the thread, the support is massively appreciated.

I'm yet to get one and waiting for new releases in 2022 to make my purchase. \n\n\n1. iPad + Apple Pencil - As everyone says, it's the most popular option. May not be the best in my opinion but serves very well and it is a tried and tested way. If you require any additional software from your lab equipment to run on it, tough luck. I feel it is popular only because people prefer to stay in the Apple ecosystem they've gotten used to.\n\n\n2. Microsoft Surface Pro - The best option in my opinion. Sadly, it is not popular because it does not fit in the Apple ecosystem. But if you've used a windows device and are comfortable with it it is the best option. It can take notes, serve as a hyper portable full laptop, and can run desktop apps. If you're gonna be doing computational work on your laptop have a look at 'Surface Studio Laptop' - Powerful and can take notes. Surface Pro is what has worked out best for many of my peers. If you've really decided to go for an iPad, based on other comments, I would just ask you to give these a look before deciding.\n\n\n3. E-ink notebooks - Like kindle but bigger for reading PDFs and note-taking. There are many less known brands in this category but the best one in this category would be the 'Onyx Boox Max Lumi 2'. It's a very niche product, targeted at only note-taking and PDF reading. The ability to have a bunch of notes interleaved with each PDF page benefits if you're the kind to scribble points next to paragraphs in textbooks. Its main advantage is its paper-like writing and reading experience. Sadly, it's not YET in color, so you're limited to black &amp; white. It will fit you if you mainly read Black &amp; White literature. If you can hold up for the next releases of colored e-ink then hold and you might get rewarded. The Max Lumi runs android so you can load any play store app like OneNote if interested to keep notes there. Since you've talked about distractions, it's not a pleasant experience fast-moving things like videos on this although you can do it once in a while if needed.

You may want to ask your therapist if you can focus up front on coping skills for when your mood and ability to function are extremely low; and just getting your mood up in general. It really does help.\n\nThe toxic expectations that are common in academia, particularly valorizing overwork and normalizing shame, make this all hard, but you can do it. It will probably feel scary at first, but try prioritizing your health every day before worrying about work. Get enough sleep, eat a real meal, move your body somehow, take any medications you're on.

Try to accept it as the way your brain is working right now-- just a situation you need to manage, that doesn't say anything good or bad about you. I found it very helpful to read about organization strategies that people with ADHD use. These folks are smart as hell and they share an incredible amount of helpful information about their lives online. As you recover, you may go through periods where you don't need to use these strategies, and times when you realize you need more support again. That's normal.\n\nYoga and meditation helped me a lot, and there are many free and accessible ways to do those from the comfort of your own home if you want. It helped to track my mood and keep doing activities that improved it, even when I sometimes didn't want to do them. It helped to tell people who care about me how I was really doing, even though it was scary and I felt ashamed.

Research shows that both (objective) neurocognitive dysfunction and (subjective) or perceived cognitive dysfunction are associated with functional disability and adverse outcomes among individuals experiencing depression. It is hypothesized that common expressions of depression, such as low-self-esteem, overly critical self-evaluation and negativism may cause an individual to be hypervigilant for or overly attentive to signals of cognitive dysfunction, leading individuals to overestimate their cognitive dysfunction and underestimate their cognitive ability. In essence, not only is it the case that having negative thoughts about the self can hinder cognitive performance, but experiences of depression can also amplify an individual's *perception* of cognitive dysfunction. This is not to invalidate or negate cognitive dysfunction caused by depression, but to say that depression can cause an individual to underestimate their actual cognitive functioning. Cognition naturally fluctuates throughout the day according to energy stores, sleep, nutrition, hormones, stress, mood and more. I think it's important to normalize the fact that cognition naturally fluctuates in order to provide some information that can work against some of the hypervigilance for and negative evaluation of your cognitive abilities during this time.

You've defended your thesis, which in itself is an enormous achievement, you're getting help, and you're going to get there.\n\nSo, into the post.\n\nI have chronic trauma-related anxiety and go through periods of bad depression that have been exacerbated by the pandemic and the pressure of having to do well academically at a time when my emotions alternate between feeling like they're going to explode and feeling numb and completely unable to commit to my work. No interest in it, no ability to do if, feeling totally listless and useless and like I don't know what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I have sat in front of the keyboard and found myself totally unable to type, or even to care. It's very difficult to explain to people who haven't experienced depression without sounding totally self-indulgent. It descends upon me seemingly out of nowhere and even if I know what I'm supposed to be doing and normally enjoy doing it, it feels like my own brain is sabotaging me by refusing to process the information. The brain fog is very familiar.\n\nPersonally, I took a temporary withdrawal to take the pressure off myself and also sought clinical help (counselling, CBT and EMDR) to gain coping strategies. I also have medical management via SSRIs that have massively helped, but the important thing I've found with those is not to rely on them to do the heavy lifting, but to have them put me in a place where I have the capability to get stronger and manage again. I can't obviously recommend SSRIs to you as it totally depends on your situation and formal clinical diagnosis, but I will say not to let yourself be afraid of any stigma you may feel is attached to them. We don't stigmatise taking levothyroxine for an underactive thyroid or insulin for diabetes; this is no different. \n\nI would recommend first and foremost being kind to yourself. That sounds silly, but it's so much easier to be self-critical and harsh with yourself than with others, and it can have a huge impact on how you feel about yourself and your academic journey. Give yourself the compassion you'd give to a friend struggling in this situation rather than beating yourself up for not feeling good enough or shirking or however it is you feel. Your feelings are valid and it's good that you're acknowledging them. I'm really glad to read that you're already seeing a psychologist - you've taken a great first step forward. It's key to remember too that mental health is a journey. Every step you take is getting you closer to that self you want to be again, but it will take time and energy and you may experience ups and downs (normal). We don't heal from these things overnight, but we *can* heal. How long it takes depends on your individual journey and what you invest in it - which you are already doing. \n\nDon't feel ashamed by it or like you're weak or a bad person. Everyone needs help sometimes and mental health is one of the most important things we have. I did mental health first aid training recently and learned that around 70-75% of people receive no treatment for diagnosable mental health conditions (https://mhfaengland.org/mhfa-centre/research-and-evaluation/mental-health-statistics/). You're not an outlier and you're definitely not alone - but you *are* on the way to helping yourself, which is fantastic.\n\nAs for getting back to your old self, I would say yes, it's definitely possible in my experience. Sometimes it takes a breather to step away and re-examine what your brain is trying to tell you it needs. That doesn't necessarily mean you don't go to work or whatever (if you're thinking that isn't possible for you) - it means that you allow time and room for yourself to do things you enjoy, even if that's just relaxing, and not feeling bad about doing it. Sometimes it means not punishing yourself for your lack of productivity in an endless cycle of self-loathing (perfectionism in particular is commonly related to anxiety and/or self-esteem). I find getting out for at least 20 minutes each day and/or doing creative things really helps my mental state. I also enjoy escapism through video games. It depends what you like and what makes you feel good. \n\nI believe in you. You're doing what you need to do and that proactivity in itself is a really good sign. Remember, be kind to yourself.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rvcy0t/mental_health_affecting_academic_performance/hr5tyzu/"}, "583": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Bumbummcgee2", "Date": 1641264980, "Score": 5, "Body": "If you're in the UK, you can reach out to NHS community mental health services without a GP referral to help with this.

Very shortly after, I had a complete breakdown (not entirely related to the PhD, though - there were myriad other factors), and it ended up taking me 9 months. Finally submitted last September. \n\nHOWEVER, through the process I realised a few things:\n\n1. It *will* get finished. So long as you just take it piece by piece, tiny chunks - sometimes as u/navyicecream said, they have to be really mundane, but they all count.\n2. It *will* get finished. Maybe you'll look at it in a couple of months and realise \"Holy shit, this is pretty much there!\"; maybe there'll be a massive flurry of activity two weeks before the final deadline; maybe you'll have to ask for an extension... but who cares? You don't get extra points for finishing early, and you don't get points deducted for going down to the wire. \n3. It *will* get finished. Your advisors seem confident in you - it's not in their interests to set you up for a fall, so trust that they know what they're talking about when they say you're ready to start writing up. *BUT* remember that *only you know* what you're writing about, how it feels when you're writing, what your process is, and how you react to different pressures. So if this year doesn't go as smoothly as you'd like, they are not going to be disappointed in you, and you're not going to get in trouble. Don't worry about living up to what you think your advisors' expectations might be, and just chip away at those tiny chunks of work.  \n4. One of the things that worried me massively was that, because I'd done three years of research, I knew how much I'd had to leave out, how much I'd not had time to cover, and how much kinda-related stuff I just didn't think was relevant. It absolutely overwhelmed me at times, because all I could think of was my supervisors or the viva examiners saying \"What about ALL THIS STUFF???\"  But even though you have to be *aware* of the wider field in order to do your research, your thesis is only a small slice of it - and your examiners are going to be looking at that small slice. They're not going to know the whole field either. Nobody does. Everybody just knows their slice. And you can be confident you know the shit out of your slice, otherwise you wouldn't be at this stage! \n5. Your university is on your side. It's not in their interests for you to drop out, or to produce a sub-standard piece of work. So if you find yourself struggling, thinking you might need an extension, or whatever, don't be afraid to talk to your advisors (or if you're unlucky enough to be cursed with rubbish advisors, talk to someone in your school or faculty office). They'll have heard it all before, and they'll be able to help you. Again, they're not going to be disappointed in you or think you're a sub-standard researcher. Every PhD student in the world ever has needed help at some point - this subreddit is testament to that! \n6. Writing groups can be really useful. A bunch of us would meet up once a month online to talk about how we're all doing - one or two of us would pass a draft around a week or so before so we could get feedback from our peers. Weekly \"Shut Up And Write\" sessions were really useful, too.  \n\nSorry for the essay, but I hope you find some of it useful. Again: it *will* be finished!  At the beginning of last year I honestly didn't even think I'd be alive by September, let alone submitting. Passed my viva last month, and started 2022 as Doctor Pete.

If you absolutely need a roommate because of money then of course just get a roommate.\n\nIf you are more of a quiet person that enjoys some alone time then I think you would enjoy living alone. You can always set up time to hangout with your cohort or lab members during the week/weekends.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rweu6e/starting_a_phd_not_get_a_roomie_or_not_to_get_a/hrdc45d/"}, "1036": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Corkmars", "Date": 1641400920, "Score": 2, "Body": "The number of courses varies a lot. I would say that on average its 3 semesters of coursework. I\u2019ve seen cases where it\u2019s 2 semesters if you have a masters degree and 4 if you don\u2019t. It\u2019ll depend on the school but I would say expect between 2-4 semesters if you\u2019re full time.\n\nIf you\u2019re a workaholic then you\u2019ll definitely work more than 9-5. There are quite a few people who only work 9-5 and do excellent work and finish their PhD (many doctoral students in the states have families and have to limit themselves to something like a 9-5, 5 day a week schedule).\nHow much time you spend on your PhD will depend on a couple things- the biggest factor is who you work with (PI, dissertation chair, etc). I\u2019ve read a bunch of nightmare stories about shitty chairs who leverage their position to drive doctoral students into working 12 hours a day. A second factor is your own attitude. You have a lot of agency over how much time you put into it. I would say you can do 9-5, 5 days a week, you can do a lot more, but you probably can\u2019t do less (unless you\u2019re a total stud). Just give yourself checks and make sure you spend time on other things that you enjoy.

In my doctoral program, I\u2019m probably one of the more Theory focused students, but then, I did my second masters in a very theory focused school. There was a lot of Derrida and Deleuze in my second masters thesis and I\u2019m working with Foucault and Agamben pretty relentlessly now.\n\nIf you\u2019ve gone directly from an undergrad to a PhD then you have a long way to go to feel comfortable with the wide range of Theory- which is what you\u2019re dealing with. Broadly, affect/trauma/queer/Decolonial etc theories are offshoots of poststructuralism- from a literary theory perspective I\u2019d assume Derrida and Saussure, Roland Barthes, and some Foucault would be your starting point. From my knowledge of having a few friends with masters in English or literature, I\u2019d imagine most of the theory heavy students did a masters between their undergrad and doctorate.\n\n\nIf you want to have a few specific sources to read on affect theory- there are a few introduction essays that are rather good. DM me and I\u2019ll think of what they are. Trauma theory is a bit harder to do on a page count. \n\nHegemonic is more a social justice word than a theory word honestly- anything outside white/cis/male/straight literature should have a grasp on that one. Ontological and epistemological are philosophical words- but at the Derrida or Foucault end of the literary theory world they show up as well. \n\nOff the top of my head, I\u2019d seriously consider the \u201cVery Short Introductions\u201d series of books.

The biggest similarity between ultra distance running and writing a PhD is the fact that they're large projects that cannot be done quickly. You cannot write a 300 page dissertation in a week, and you cannot train for a 100km ultra in a week. So, for both of them, you have to 1) identify your goal, 2) break down the goal into small pieces, 3) progress every day towards your major goal by achieving some small thing(s).  \n\nSometimes people ask me if you need to run 60k when preparing for a 60k ultra. No, that'd be counter-productive because the time you need to rest will be significant, whereas running 30k over two days is much easier and will enable you to run further in a given week. What I mean is, it makes more sense to run 10k six times a week intead of running 50k once a week.  \n\nThe philosophy for my PhD writing was the same. I would get tired and write low quality material if I tried to do too much, so I just decided to write a tiny bit (almost) every day. When I started my PhD, I read that if you write 500 words a day then a full dissertation will take one year. 500 words is approximately half a page. I thought, \"Goddamn, I can do that, half a page isn't that much\", and writing those 500 became a goal of mine. Life gets in the way and I had other responsibilities as a PhD student so of course it didn't happen literally every day, but I had what I called writing periods where my goal was always just those 500 words.\n\nThis did two things. First of all, and most importantly, it created a positive feedback loop. This is *really fucking crucial* because maintaining a positive attitude is such a key piece. If you sit down and want to read an entire book and you inevitably fail, then that feels awful and you might be hard on yourself. On the other hand, if you set yourself a *tiny tiny* but **achieveable** goal and reach it, then that feels great.  \n\nSecondly, this also meant steady progress. 500 words isn't a lot, but 500 words every day in just a week is 3,5 pages! That's crazy! My dissertation is 300 pages and I think in my most productive day ever I wrote like 2,5 pages. \n\nDuring my three years I also published 4 articles and a book review. I am not a particularly smart or even hard-working person (I realize that this might sound silly, but I have met people who are *actually* smart and who *actually* work hard and their game is just different). I waste so much time playing video games and doing other nerd stuff, but it is my impression that procrastination really gets brutal for a lot of people. I kept those 500 words in mind even on my lazy days. \n\nWhen running gets tough I visualize my goal and I train harder because I don't want to fail, but I *will* fail if I don't train. The PhD was largely the same. I visualized the finished dissertation and constantly daydreamt about my defense. Then there's also a willingness to embrace pain and try new and scary things etc. For example, I signed up for my first Ironman triathlon before I could even swim. I literally couldn't swim to save my life but now I had to do 3,8km in open water.

Obviously there\u2019s much more to it, but thinking about the shitty labor conditions and calculating my piss poor hourly wage has helped me to set *some* boundaries with my time \u2026 not that I\u2019m always very successful, but it\u2019s something. \n\nIn the end, I just don\u2019t want to work myself to death for this degree and then beg for scraps when I\u2019m looking for work\u2026 (I\u2019m in US, so your academic job market may or may not differ). \n\nThis is also probably much more difficult in other fields, but I\u2019ve long given up the idea that my literature dissertation is going to change the world in any way (though I strive to make it relevant and justice-oriented in whatever ways are possible).

A PhD is a body of work that extends a field of study. This work is completed usually in apprenticeship to a subject matter expert that is in or related to youe topic of interest. This is one of the most important relationships of your PhD and can make or break it. On top of this is the other members of your committee, who can be other professors or subject matter experts who help to review certain aspects of your work.\n\nEvery program is different in expectation to publish work to journals, but all culminate in a dissertation, which contains a mixture of background information, problem statements, and methods/arguments for or against methods, as solutions to the problem stated. This dissertation is then defended in front of a committee, who ultimately decide whether or not the work is complete and worthy of a PhD and will give you edits accordingly.\n\nThe overall process is mentally and physically challenging and plenty of people run through various stages of burnout because of it. It taxes all aspects of the lives of people who go through them, and experiences in them range wildly from very positive to very negative. I have a wonderful advisor, who has said that if my Masters Thesis has enough work left to elicit more work in a PhD that she would be happy to have me on board and use my thesis as the first few chapters of my dissertation.

Endurance is everything, but it's emotional, mental, and physical. In a PhD you need to deal with emotional distress (stress), mental fatigue, physical fatigue -- sleep deprivation, lack of exercise (take care of your body). \n\nI am in my fourth year first thing and for me the worst thing is the fear of missing out of normal life (and my youth), watching people getting married, finding great jobs, and achieving seemingly fulfilling things. Don't compare yourself, many people around you may appear to be successful, but can be struggling inside, just like you. You must accept that for some things, PhD life is a 'waiting' room. It's not about the destination, it's about learning from the journey. Take time to think if you're enjoying the journey, if not, reward small success, reward yourself for hard work, reward resilience. Re-evaluate what you want from the PhD.\\*\\* (see comment way below) Hot take: make sure to make friends, and have a support system. Make time for people that support you, just make sure it's not escapism from what you want to achieve.\n\nIf you fall into escapism over and over, consider quitting or taking a break from a PhD. What you want can change, and if that is the case, quitting is not a waste. The time isn't \"lost\" if you learned from it.\n\nAnother difficulty is the uncertainty of being competent and adequate to get it done; uncertainty to produce a worthy dissertation; uncertainty of achieving necessary results (on any given day); uncertainty on how to proceed (you are often treading an beyond the known realm of science and sometimes no one can guide you). These thoughts can crush you, so it is better to take it a day at a time.\n\nResults are important, but you must accept failure; many experiments will fail. Failure is your best teacher. So document failure, celebrate failure and try new things. Even if you think it might fail.\n\n\\*\\* Take my comments with a grain of salt. I sometimes feel lost. I'd be lying if I told you I haven't thought about quitting. The pandemic lost me 2 years of potential research. I had to start my dissertation over (completely different project) from scratch since my advisor was laid off. Many people consider quitting along the way. It's human.

Number of pages are quite similar (150+, &lt;200, both **double space for the lines**), but with around 50+ pages of annexes/appendix. \n2. Both had an intro, systematic review, discussion, conclusion\n3. One had an objective chapter (&lt;2/3 pages)\n4. One had two results chapters (with Methods for each), the other had only one result chapter (and one Methods chapter)\n5. Both had no publications related to their thesis (hence, less work)  \n\n\nSo, according to the format required by my university (since they passed), so you may need to check yours, this was definitely less work. But, remember that this is a two year MPhil: it is difficult to publish in this short period, maybe requires 1 or 2 months for writing + review, and 7 courses to pass, so definitely less time. It could be as intense as a PhD, because it's a lot of things to do in a very little amount of time. \n\nHowever, if you already have the content for one chapter (or two), congratulations, it's already done, you just have to write (no publication pressure, no additional content). It's also, because of this, very easy to link everything (the more you have chapters, the more difficult it might be to link them together). Finally, the most important: it's only two years. Yes, it is exhausting, but if you lack motivation already, you will definitely be better leaving now that leaving in 2 years, unless you get the motivation boosts we received (sometimes) after our first publication or something similar (I got one, very good journal, almost no amount of work to do from the reviewers comments, my supervisors said this was the first time they had almost so little changes to do).   \n\n\nAs a comparison (and just for indication, it's my thesis, so not a generalizable example), one result chapter in my dissertation draft is &gt;50 pages, I have 4/5 (depending on what my supervisor thinks, still discussion in progress, because we could merge two chapters). If you had the intro, systematic review, objectives/aims, discussion chapters, it definitely could reach &gt;250 pages (without annexes), and I need one additional publication (just for the sake of it, the one additional chapter requires to be a draft manuscript, and should be sent for review after the PhD for publication). But I had MORE time, MORE content (but also MORE stress and LESS mental stability haha).   \n\n\nOnce again, it really depends on your university requirements, but don't feel ashamed for doing a MPhil, it still is an additional diploma that most do not have, and it shows you have your foot in the \"research topic\", many \"masters\" graduated students never have.   \nHowever, if you allow me to criticize one thing: the fact that you are self funded is a shame, the school should have got you fundings. Having a student potentially publishing for them helps them a lot, because it adds recognition, justify their grants, and they have a lot of benefits from you even later (say you become famous, \"Oh where did this famous guy study -&gt; Boom, this university -&gt; Increased recognition for the next 20 years\"). You are also doing the job that some of their staff could be doing without you, and they would have been paid. Even if they would have not worked on your ideas, imagine it's a breakthrough, who get the recognition? Your supervisors, you, and your school. Training you doesn't justify you working for free (even more paying them).

I imagine right now he's freaking out about the thesis as a whole and the end result looming over him. He might benefit from picking a topic or chapter at a time, setting himself an amount of time, and writing whatever he can on it just for that specific period. The constraint might give him motivation to write because it narrows his focus on the bare bones instead of sitting in front of his keyboard all day wondering what to write (I've been there!).\n\nAnother tip I was given was to take the pressure off myself in producing perfect material on the first go and just \\*write\\* to get into the process of writing. It doesn't need to be absolutely exquisite stuff, just more about getting into the flow of thinking about it and having ideas translate to the keyboard. Opinions vary on this, but it helps me.\n\nAnother thing is his writing style. For example, I almost never start off writing an introduction or at the very beginning; I write about whatever is foremost on my mind or whatever I feel most confident about first and then stitch the paragraphs into a cohesive whole later on. If I try to start at the beginning, it often feels like too much pressure and it's easier for me to work backwards in that way. His mileage may vary, but he might find that the writer's block he's experiencing unblocks a little if he picks a starting point that isn't necessarily the start but what he feels most comfortable with/confident on, just to get things going.\n\nBest of luck to him!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ryfrx7/support_phd_student/hroit24/"}, "1471": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "willthevoidanswer", "Date": 1641585914, "Score": 2, "Body": "They're some good ideas :) thank you!

These two goals are not the same and you should not treat academia as a production line. \n\n\n&gt;most of academics avoid risky ideas to secure funding and having more papers\n\nAgain, completely untrue. You're not even in the realm of reality. Yes, we want to secure more funding, but to do so we have to pick a topic that *has never been done* and hope that it goes somewhere. Musk was too big a coward to take that leap. Every single PhD in the world that didn't start rich has bigger balls than Musk. \n\nIn addition to being a coward, Musk is insecure. He takes credit for the science that actual researchers performed. He has done nothing. No learning, no innovation. He bought a company (PayPal) using his daddy's blood money then  claimed he \"co-founded\". He didn't, he just renamed it. He's good at giving people money, but he does not understand science or research. He does not understand whose shoulders he stands on, nor does he care who he tramples. \n\n\n&gt;most people are narrow minded about changing the system.\n\nNo, they aren't. The reason it doesn't change is because academia is insufficiently funded to pursue its goal. Until governments open the purse strings to academia the way they do the military, academic institutions believe they have to have a way of ranking and judging their employees. And again, you ignorance shows, because it's not papers that matter to the universities, it's money. That money comes from government agencies who rank based on prestige, essentially. Virtually all academics would love a different way of doing things, but the government gets to make that choice. \n\n\n&gt;who is taking risk\n\nAcademics are. Musk isn't. Musk is so rich that nothing is a risk. Academics have thrown their intelligence, diligence, and abilities trained over decades into learning and educating, and we can lose our jobs at the drop of the hat because we had an idea that didn't work out. And once you fail, that's often it. Your life dreams are over and you have to go find what comes next. That's risk on a level Musk will never know. \n\nStop idolizing a petulant narcissist.

There are going to be differences between universities and even between programs at the same university. \n\nNow, in the biomedical sciences, most research and training funding comes from the federal government. There are lots of rules regarding who can and cannot be funded on different grants. Nationality is one such factor, which is the root of the problem. Each program leverages a different array of grants to fund its students, which means that the practical reality of being a domestic vs. international student at each program is different. \n\nBut, even having enrolled in a program, choosing a PI can be a complicated matter. For one thing, it's never entirely your choice---it has to be a mutual decision. This is especially true if you need to find a PI to fund you, which is more often the case for international students than for domestic. PIs have limited capacity on how many students they can advise at one time and even more so how many they can fund at one time. \n\nWhat does all this mean for you, as a prospective applicant? Minimally, you need to identify programs where there are multiple PIs whose research interests you, because you can't guarantee a placement in any one lab or that those labs are a good fit for you. As you narrow down the list, you also need to explore what the exact funding situation is at each program for international students. \n\nContacting a PI does not mean negotiating for a specific project nor is it even a guaranteed road to admission at top programs. It is starting a high-level discussion about interests, more or less to see if you could be a good fit in the lab and department more broadly. Think of it more like dating than a job interview. Generally, contacting PIs happens during the application cycle, so you introduce yourself as a current applicant wanting to learn more about the opportunities in the program. \n\nZooming out again to look at the big picture, I'm focused on your original question of identifying what programs to apply to. Especially since the US PhD admissions process is not attached to specific projects, your search needs to be motivated by professors and labs whose work interests you. From there, you can identify programs that are promising in terms of (1) having multiple options of interesting faculty to work with, and (2) funding situation. For the latter, you will generally need to make contact because that information is usually not open to the public.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rxp43e/phd_genetics_cancerdevelopmental_in_america/hrvc81t/"}, "1684": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "raspberriesp", "Date": 1641701786, "Score": 3, "Body": "It seems like you\u2019ve already found the encouragement you needed but let me add another voice to it!

Getting through a PhD and onto the next career step along the path (perhaps a series of postdocs in your research interest areas) is the most advisable path to someone who wishes to do multidisciplinary research.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rzm3rt/is_this_practical_to_get_3_phds_if_your_career/hrwuw1u/"}, "1762": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "naturebegsthehike", "Date": 1641736297, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yea.

They're half-counselor, half-institutional problem-solver, and are confidential.\n\nFrom your description, what happened is plagiarism and a form of fraud and it could result in serious consequences for the new student who did it, not just if they don't get their scholarship award. They could be expelled, especially if your unethical advisor blames them when they get caught. It is against research integrity rules and if it had your advisor's OK they could also face consequences.\n\nIf you were in a secure position it would be easy to run to the highest ivory tower and say it loud and clear. However, you are not in a secure position. You still have to graduate, you still need a job, and you still need to publish your work with your advisor, who has a lot of power over all these aspects of your future. So if you got them all in trouble you could face retaliation and hardship. In my personal experience, academics who do one shady and unethical breach of conduct are usually doing way more. This has probably happened before, and your advisor risks being discovered. If they are super shady (and this isn't just a miscommunication) they may go after you in multiple ways.\n\nSo the decision of what to do is not so easy, because if you do nothing, fraud happens but you move on, but if you say something you shine light on the fraud but have a difficult immediate future. It might end up being more prudent to not take action on blowing the whistle, at least until after you cannot be directly harmed. But you could also miss the window of opportunity to stop it before it gets worse. A worthy student elsewhere could miss out on that scholarship because of this fraud, and that can't be fixed later.\n\nYou should absolutely document everything in as much detail as you can, including the slides from their presentation. If you don't have the slides, you could even be a little sneaky and offer pointers if they send you the slides to check over. Note dates and times. Make copies, confirm witnesses.\n\nIt is possible to fix this without ugliness, and that is by communicating with the student/professor that your name must be in the presentation, properly credited, and no taking credit for that work. Maybe the student doesn't feel right about doing it as well. Maybe they're still pretty green and didn't realize how it looks. They would have to fix it, and the easiest way to save face is to withdraw their scholarship application with no explanation. (Maybe a Dean could see to it they just don't get nominated for the scholarship so you are protected from retaliation?)

He mentions in the book that if you manage to solve any of those problems then to contact him and come get your PhD degree.\n\nThe idea is simple: to get a PhD you need to write a thesis that makes a significant contribution to some area of study. The length doesn't matter, John Nash of Nash Equilibrium had a PhD thesis of just 26 pages. Philip S Low of Purdue University has a PhD thesis which is 1 page long.\n\nThe key here is that they made a significant contribution. Most people outside academia think that publishing is all that matters and that's because most theses today are just a staple-together of 4 or more publications. That's not the point. Katie Bouman had essentially 1 published paper on her thesis topic but it was on visualizing black holes which was so novel that MIT gladly awarded her a PhD.\n\nOf course if you're in a PhD program, the university will have requirements you need to complete since they are obligated to train you to be a researcher. However at the end of the day, your final thesis is what decides whether you're awarded the degree.\n\nLong story short, if you come up with something absolutely groundbreaking, then you can just email a professor in the field and they'll either invite you to join their lab and get your degree in a short period of time, or point out the flaws in your work and why it isn't a worthy contribution.

Great for you that you're thinking about it correctly. I only got there after many many years. The PhD is a lot of time from your life, it'd be better if we don't grit our teeth through it, right?  \nSo my conclusion, with a group of like-minded friends, was that you have to practice it. It's a sort of mindfulness. Sometimes (often) the answer to progress is indeed 'nagging' others for help, but of course you need to be gentle and learn independence and handle things alone. So, how do you balance these subtle things, how do you find the 'key for success'?  \nI think the answer is carving out the path. It's not that all decisions you make will be right, but for me at least, you sometimes get overwhelmed and lost, and this feeds into itself. You try things not whole-heartedly, or don't try them at all. So what is the mindful alternative? Realize you're likely to make a lot of mistakes either way, but eventually, at some point, you'll see progress. How do you implement this? By taking charge. Ask yourself questions, keep a journal, log, meditate, use productivity-logging apps. You must know what you did each day, each week. Even if you have 50% of a negative answer (e.g. \"I'm almost sure this doesn't work, but not entirely sure yet\") - it's completely different when it's a half-hearted gut feeling, compared to when you have a powerpoint explaining your attempts and reasoning to yourself (and your PI). I find trying to compile a list of daily non-binary questions to answer in writing really helps - i.e. not \"did I succeed with this action item\" (to which the answer is rarely yes), but \"did I learn something today? Was I surprised by anything? Would I have spent my time differently in retrospect? Do I know how tomorrow will be different?\"  \nYou are a visionary. You are a CEO. You are almost by definition doing something no one has ever exactly done before. So - be responsible. Lead your people - first and foremost, yourself - on this journey. You won't make every turn correctly, but we need to learn to be captains of our own progress.

Everyone who did theory is currently either unemployed, underemployed, or on their 4th or 5th post-doc. Experimentalists did better. Most of them got reasonable jobs in industry fairly quickly, but still got paid way less than they would have in fields of similar difficulty like law, medicine, or advanced engineering. That's just how science is. Work for the military or medicine (in the US), or put up with low pay. Despite this, afterwards, it might be hard to find a job \\*where\\* you want to work. If you become too specialized, it might be easy to find a job - sure - but there might only be like 5 or 10 cities in the world where the jobs your qualified for exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if you want to get anywhere, you need to pick a field of physics which has a quick return on technology.

PhDs are not a \"time to learn\" like some people make them out to be. It's a time to publish papers for your PI so they can advance in their career and you can too if you're lucky. It's fairly common to be expected to put in 60 hours per week. And even if you're lucky and the lab you work at expects 50 hours per week, you're very unlikely to get more than 32k / year... or about $13.5 per hour - assuming 4 weeks of vacation which we all know is NOT the standard in academia. That's literally less than you could currently make working in a chick-fil-a kitchen, and about half of what a line cook at a Danish McDonalds makes. Moreover, academia is a horribly dishonest and archaic system where absolute power rests in the hands of your PI. The stereotype of \"slave labor grad students\" exists for a reason... Idk.

I'm like you in that I went straight from undergrad into a 5-year PhD program (US-based). The key aspect for me was realizing that I worked my butt off during my PhD and everything I accomplished while in that insane grind is at least something that ended up directly benefiting me (in the form of graduating earlier, more papers/talks, etc.). If I work that hard in my industry job, they'll just give me more work or expect that pace from me all the time and I won't see the benefit. Sure, maybe I'd get a promotion 3-6 months earlier than I would have at my current pace, but for me that isn't a large enough benefit or incentive for me to work harder anymore. It might be different in other industries, but that is my current situation. I put in my 40 hours of good, honest work and that is all they get from me. If there is a true emergency/crazy deadline, I consider working over for 1-2 hours a few times per year, but that's all they get. Haven't received any complaints yet and my supervisors are happy with my work and productivity.\n\nUnless someone is purely motivated by their career, I highly recommend taking the above approach. I worked a ridiculous number of hours during my PhD and would cry from exhaustion and burnout multiple times per week. I used to burst into tears randomly because I was so stressed all the time. That doesn't happen anymore. I'm also able to eat more healthy and be active again, and I'm re-discovering hobbies!\n\nWishing you the absolute best with your new, shifting mindset OP.

Any conference papers abstracts sent to her  are either ignored or getting green lighted without even minor corrections (which doesn't mean my writing is good it means she does not read them). Also it is understandable as she's a process engineer who picked up a climate change project collab, but I am not sure of what signs of involvement you are talking here now. I've met the lady 2 years since the project kick off because she only attends big meetings. She always kindly accepts all meeting requests and says she's very excited to attend them but she shows up for maybe 50% of the meetings she accepted invites for. And yes all the attendees get agenda and reminder before the meeting. Somehow I even got a physical meeting with her to which she was very excited to drive (was totally her idea to come to us) . She came, had a cuppa and took off back.  No formal meeting happened, she just wanted to travel I guess. \n\nThe admin work in my university is nothing close comparing to the uni I did my msc at, but I think that constantly ghosting supervisor is a key issue in my case. She received email from the registry about missing paperwork but the email \"got lost in her inbox as she was skiing\". So yeah you are totally right in saying that project is very low in her priorities. And that was kinda my point. But I stead of picturing busy academic we may also want to talk about some people who pick up projects they have no interest in to get extra funding and potentially publications. \nI know where you are coming from and I have seen the students who is just sitting tight until their supervisor comes to ask for a meeting and tell them what experiments to do and what to write, but not all students are lazy, and not all supervisors are poor busy bees. Even if they are - it's poor time management and they simply should not take more students if they can't meet with them once every 4 months (this is frequency of meetings I need and she always dodges them). \n\nAlso I wish I could log in somewhere and follow up on forms etc. I am not structured PhD so I don't get that whiteboard/exam account some of students have and all my progression reviews come to reports. Being based across a country from my university doesn't help with communication either. Just so you imagine the scale of her lack of  presence in projects of her students - we have a rota of her students who in case if she is ghosting someone goes to her office to gently  remind her there's urgent stuff we need from her. We have to have rota because we are nit allowed on campus all the time due to covid, and emails just \"getting lost\" in her inbox, even if marked as urgent.\n\nThe most important - she is not a PI of my project, just an academic supervisor who has 0 research interest in climate change (judging by her publications).

So when asking about or researching higher education in business that\u2019s usually what\u2019s going to pop up. And I will say an MBA is (in my mind) one of the most useful degrees out there as far as if you just want to enhance the probability of success in your career. That\u2019s why so many people even in other fields get it and so many companies recommend it for advancement. So that\u2019s usually what\u2019s going to pop up.\nBut back to your question. As far as getting a PhD In management, I chose it, one, due to my background as I have a bachelors in actuarial science and an MBA, and two, I loved the broadness of it. Now many people probably wouldn\u2019t. Most People going for a PhD has a field of study that\u2019s more specific or enjoy learning the  most complex inter-workings  and theories of their desired field. I loved (and still do) the amount of avenues and the breadth business management covers. Basically if has to do with the performance of an area of business, we can study it. \nNow one of the cool things about it is there\u2019s also so many ways to go about it. Unlike many PhDs that may be extremely quantitative or qualitative in their research, Business management is split almost right down the middle. You\u2019ll find researchers and professors split almost 50/50 in that one prefers quantitative work while another prefers qualitative. This allows us to measure performance of a business in about as many ways as possible. Especially since when working with both quantitative and qualitative work there are so many additional theories and ways to apply such work.  Yes there may have been a study done on business X on why it is failing. The person could have done it quantitatively where they took a survey or had access to data that allowed them to collect data points and found out (just for sake of a super simple and quick example) that over spending on Y was the reason X was doing poorly. Well that could be true and a big reason. But then someone else could come along and do say a qualitative study and found out from employees or customers that the owner or management was such assholes or terrible at their job and that\u2019s the main reason or a big reason X was doing poorly or over spending(also just a simple dumb example lol) . Business management tries to go about research in every way possible that can lead to an answer of why something is happening. Heck sometimes it\u2019s even replicating a study to prove and enforce previous research. Which is also extremely important in our field. \nThis ability to go about research in so many different ways and the ability to choose so many different subjects/topics is why I like it. Plus I feel any research I do can be beneficial to someone someday. Maybe someone trying to start a business in an area I researched for example\u2026etc. \nThe one area I would say that\u2019s not as great is that it is closer to other types of degrees than most PhDs. In that it can be like a masters or undergrad as far as it\u2019s can be more about learning more theories, and improving yourself as a researcher than actually doing  research and pumping out papers like many PhDs. They focus way more in educating you and getting you prepared for your dissertation than I\u2019d say most. You seem less of a fellow researcher and more of student getting prepared to be a researcher. They get you to start basically working on your dissertation from day 1 in a certain way. Of course you do get invited to be part of research but not as often as many PhDs and it\u2019s usually to aid and be part of one of your professors work since your own may be related to it. \nNow for me personally I\u2019m focusing on the service industry. Specifically independent restaurants. Since they tend to have a higher rate of failure than most independent business, I\u2019m looking into why that may be so maybe it can be corrected some. When I first started I was sure it\u2019d do a quantitative study do to my background but honestly after actuarial studies and my MBA I think I just wanted to do something a little different. So at moment my study is more qualitative in nature. You can do a mixed study of both but you also risk focusing to much on one side or the other or not getting deep enough into the research. Currently leaning more so in a case study but phenomenology or groused theory also seem like viable options. \nHope I explained some of that well and sorry the answer is so long lol.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s2gksm/i_was_not_prepared_for_the_amount_of_people_who/hsir4fg/"}, "2843": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "chillzxzx", "Date": 1642099477, "Score": 5, "Body": "One thing to remember is that it looks bad on the PI if you can't finish.

I love him and it's really great, but I'll speak about some of the important factors to consider that can make your life kinda difficult:\n\n1) most important: do you have a roomate, **very** reliable friend, or family nearby etc.? Dogs need to be walked at minimum twice a day and like routine; sometimes late classes or lab work mean it's hard to be home at the same time everyday, so it's really nice to have someone around who can walk the dog in case of emergency. This also applies to travel obviously; it's more rare but it can be an absolute nightmare finding someone to watch your dog for a week if you're visiting family.\n\n2) cost: dogs can be expensive. I always recommend people rescue, but sometimes they can have unforeseen problems; my dog had heartworm we found a week after we got him (6 months old, found in a rural area not rescued from a shelter). The treatment cost like $1500 total... but man, after you spend a week cuddling with a young dog there's no way you can not help him.\n\n3) unforeseen stuff: i'll just say it, some dogs are a nightmare. Tear up furniture, pee out of anger/stress, etc. It's really hard to know what you're getting into, but a dog is a **big** commitment; in my eyes you have to accept that you can deal with all of this stuff even if it never happens, because it's not acceptable to take a dog and then give it back because it has some problem.\n\nAnyway, that sounds bad but only because I listed only the negatives. My dog is a source of constant joy 100% of the time, I love him like a child and he definitely makes me feel very loved.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s3l0io/getting_a_dog/hsmardn/"}, "3015": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Vetni", "Date": 1642162610, "Score": 1, "Body": "Did you end up getting a job? :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/6m8ajb/graduating_with_phd_midnext_year_with_0_chances/hsmbcgg/"}, "3016": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ShootTheChicken", "Date": 1642162662, "Score": 3, "Body": "But I have to teach in two hours...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s3pkrb/supervisor_just_told_me_to_take_the_rest_of_the/hsmbfh5/"}, "3017": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Floyd228999", "Date": 1642163162, "Score": 77, "Body": "I don\u2019t really play it.

I literally got an email this week with my advisor once again deciding I need to change my theoretical focus from the theory I want to use and have experience with to another theory they want me to use. This is at least the third time they have done this resulting in months of work going down the drain. \n\nSorry, more of a warning than actual advise, but having had this happen multiple times and once again looking at the prospect of having to start over I felt like you needed to hear what could happen.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s406yb/advisor_said_to_find_a_different_theorist_to_base/hsofbnq/"}, "3103": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Curse_Of_Death", "Date": 1642193988, "Score": 1, "Body": "Hello, i am interested in doing a non employmet phd ,(very similar to what you have) do you mind sharing what obligations do you have towards your university, also the university allow you do the phd remote for its entire duration ?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s352ma/phd_external_funding_in_germany_international/hsofja6/"}, "3104": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bone_druid", "Date": 1642195345, "Score": 0, "Body": "As far as I know, data being non parametric doesn't bail you out of needing to estimate significance using an appropriate statistical method", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s38b4a/i_made_this_at_3am_last_night/hsoj1n8/"}, "3105": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Stilgar_the_Naib", "Date": 1642195353, "Score": 2, "Body": "Got it.

Not everyone, but well over half it seems.\\* I think this is an issue of framing, though. When you ask the question you ask, OP, I compare it to the alternative... specifically, how fun it'd be to be doing something OTHER than a PhD. \n\nI'm old. I've had a lot of jobs - in the 3 digits. I've been in 2 PhD programs. One of them was far and away the best \"real\" job I've ever had. The most fun, the most fulfilling... you name it. The people ruled. The students, both those that I taught and those that were studying in the program along with me, ruled. (Well... all but one. He sucked.) I had the freedom to study as I chose more or less and the guidance and support to make that purposeful.\n\nThe other... it wasn't anywhere near the worst job I had, but yeah, it ate ass. In the end, a terrible, rigid, full-of-himself advisor and a detached cohort reminded me that PhD programs exist in the real world with other jobs. That said, I was also pretty stubborn about learning and researching in the directions I felt most appropriate, so it wasn't a waste in that regard. Combine that with a few people who did care about what they were doing and who they were doing that with, and that made that experience far from the worst I've ever had. (It did, however, pretty much take a giant dump on my future, so yeah, keep in mind that there is the experience itself - what happens during - and also what comes after.)\n\nThe above gets me to the point. For me, these comparisons will have a lot to do with the people and the environment you end up in. And, research in advance as you may (and you should, definitely), that's hard to really sufficiently know until you are actually doing it. I didn't know my first PhD would be rad, and I didn't know the second would be such a frickin' turd.\n\nBut when I think about what I could've been doing instead, and when I think about what could've come after, versus what has come not finishing, and versus what would have been had I just peaced out after my Master's, well.... the PhD (even the crappy one) was generally more fun, and also would've given me more control and agency had I been able to see it through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be totally fair, though... I think jobs are kinda stupid. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*And I think the proof is in the pudding - this is a place to vent for a lot of people, but a lot of those same people come here, vent, and then go kick ass and finish their PhDs.

However, I was very sure about what I was doing. Before you enter of a journey which will take a lot of time, energy, and oftentimes much more than that, I think you need to be sure this is the right thing for you. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me, even in private, if you want to know more about my experience. But there is at least one important think I need to say. A lot of people who are \"passionate about studying\" end up hating doing a PhD and research. Because it's a very different type of learning. I don't even know if we should call it learning. Learning is typically about learning the existing knowledge, absorbing what other people know. Research is very different, is about finding what nobody really knows. We don't even know if we will learn anything, it can be just a huge waste of time and a series of failures. \n\nSo, at the very least I think you should see if you would be passionate about research, not only about learning. Passionate enough to devote and sacrifice huge parts of your life for it. And the sacrifice will not be only yours, people close to you will be affected by it. \n\nFor example, you don't even know where in the world you will be after you graduate, if you really want to stay in academia. I applied for jobs in 3 different continents, the job market is really international. I ended up getting a job in the US, but I even got interviews to work in Norway. I'll move to another state, with drastic changes in lifestyle. \n\nAnd, if you go back to industry, the PhD probably will be a waste of time, money, effort, experience, networking, etc. For business, spending 5 years working in industry is much better than spending 5 years doing a PhD if you want a job in industry.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s4wpqo/bit_of_imposter_syndrome_unsure_if_im_being/hstystt/"}, "3380": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BionicKid", "Date": 1642290473, "Score": 3, "Body": "I'm in Communication, so YMMV.

First is to not put life on hold. I don't intend to be mean, but grad school is uncertain. You may or may not complete it and you may or may not finish the PhD whether or not you have a child. It may add a year to your time to degree, but I've always tried to work with my students (as a prof, as the DGS, and even as the Grad College Dean-- where we amended college rules to add two years to some of our conditions and deadlines if one becomes a parent.\n\nAcademia is uncertain. I've seen too many people, both students and faculty, put off too much of living to focus just on academia but fail to succeed in academia. Some will say to have a back-up plan, and I think that is good. But, even if you succeed in academia-- finish the PhD with awards and accolades-- I still think it is a mistake to put off things like kids and/or marriage. \n\nI recall that in my first year as my department's DGS, one of the very senior, powerful prof's that it was my job to convince one of her most promising grad students not to get married. She was twice divorced and told me to convince the grad student that one can either be a successful scholar/academic or have a successful marriage. I was too timid at the time (this was early in my career-- I still was an assoc. prof-- to tell that prof that she was full of shit and I didn't agree and wouldn't do it, but I didn't do it. That student now is a full prof at U Iowa, which is a perfectly decent placement, and she still is married. (OK, I don't keep in touch with that student except to have drinks at a conference, but still married, three kids, and a successful academic career seem to suggest she is fairly happy in life.)\n\nI won't be so bold as to call it wisdom, but I offer this same advice to new assistant profs and even post docs. Academia, like life, is uncertain. Marriage and kids can slow you down, **but putting them off doesn't guarantee success either**. You might get cancer tomorrow and have to undergo a year or more of treatment. That too would slow you down. \n\nWhere I am, most advisors/mentors/PI's/departments/colleges will adjust timetables and expectations, at least for a while. Frankly, given the story I told about my colleague pressuring me to tell a woman to not marry, I'd even say not to talk about it in advance with your advisor in advance just in case they are like my colleague. First, for many, becoming pregnant might take time, even a couple of years. **Second, and most important**, if your advisor thinks you have a lot of promise, s/he will work with you to make sure you can complete the degree. \n\nSorry, I think I've rambled too much here. \n\n# TL/DR: Life is uncertain both in the real world and in academia. Don't put life on hold for a degree that may or may not work our. The minimax regret strategy says to have a child now because it is not a complete certainty that you will finish the degree and it is not certain whether completing the degree will have the results for which you hope.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/s5docu/advice_for_thinking_about_having_kids_during_a_phd/hswv0ju/"}, "3514": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "thallomys", "Date": 1642348911, "Score": 2, "Body": "I purposefully chose to time my pregnancy so that I\u2019d be giving birth during grad school.

There are a few reasons for this, but the main one is that it will get the ball rolling on a few papers (probably as co-author). This will mean you\u2019ll have an output track record prior to your PhD, and it will also mean you have more publications on finishing (and therefore more competitive for postdocs and funding). \n\nSecondly, it\u2019ll help you get a feel for the \u2018world\u2019 of research and pick up some valuable skills. That means you won\u2019t be spending your first year trying to wrap your head around the basic stuff, and can focus on your actual project - instead of, for example, learning how to format for journals, etc. \n\nThirdly, any networking is good networking, and being in amongst the action will allow you to do this.

It is a stressful journey and nearly half of all people pursuing a PhD do not [finish](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/almost-50-of-all-doctoral-students-dont-graduate/). That is a huge opportunity cost for most people to join a program then drop out after a few years.\n\nFor you here are my reasons why you should reconsider.\n\n1. You have to re-complete your undergraduate degree. That means, at a minimum, you're probably looking at 8 years from now to finish your PhD.\n2. Your goals are misaligned with the programs you are targeting. I'm using hyperbole here, but if you put the word teaching in an application to a top business school PhD program, your application is going in the trash. Those schools want you to become a world-class researcher.\n3. Your goals are misaligned with PhD programs generally. Generally, you need 18 graduate credit hours in the discipline you will be teaching in. That's it - no PhD necessary. PhD programs are generally for research, not teaching.\n4. PhD programs in management are getting longer with their duration increasingly becoming five and even six years. There were a few in my cohort that took seven years. This most likely means that you will finish your PhD in ten years if you started your UG tomorrow.\n5. The labor market is tight. Schools are overproducing PhDs and reducing TT lines.\n6. Even if you come from a top school, you still need to publish if you want to get hired in a balanced school.\n7. You mention that you want a PhD from a top university but your UG is from a non prestigious university. Top universities tend to look at your UG among other things when evaluating candidates. To increase your chance of admission (but not guarantee) you probably should look at top UG schools.  I'll not elaborate on the benefits, but it isn't just the name that helps out.\n8.

Momentum is key with experiments, but very hard to maintain if you are switching back and forth from the wet lab to the dry lab.

It's a major crisis in science that is not discussed nearly as much as it ought to be. It is very hard to get theory papers in big journals, your experimental colleagues will almost certainly not understand your theory work well, and funders do not like giving money to theory projects.

Before you do anything drastic, I'd say it's probably worth chatting with them about your and their expectations for how much support you'll be getting - my supervisors were very hands off (I basically did my own thing and checked in with them once a month), which was okay for me, but not all supervisors are like that, not everybody responds best to that, and it's not unreasonable to want a little bit of hand holding in your first couple of months.

I will, however, throw out that while my MS thesis supervisor wasn\u2019t the \u201cexcitable\u201d type anyway, he seemed extra even-mannered when I defended my thesis. Several weeks later he messaged me a note letting me know he was sorry if he seemed \u201coff\u201d that morning (which I hadn\u2019t really noticed- I was too nervous), and let me know that he got a call about 15 minutes before he walked in informing him that his mother had just died. While not super congratulatory or excitable, the fact that he showed up at all and thought enough of me to not want to mention it in case it would throw me off was very kind of him. (I did assure him we could have rescheduled.) It sounds like your supervisor is maybe a different type than this, but for my own peace of mind and happiness I try to remember that most people are doing the best they can even if it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d showing up. With that said, I\u2019m really sorry this happened and put a damper on your celebration.\n\nHow are you celebrating your massive success?

Flattening all stipends just doesn't make sense in that case or in many others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, even in high CoL areas, the potential to save is much higher since you can choose to live very frugally with roommates, w/o car in urban areas, etc. So high stipend + high CoL adds options and flexibility that low CoL + low stipend does not.

And everyone I know at HGSE (the ed school) has no trouble getting around 6k more in summer funding. It's not 100% guaranteed (but neither is any part of the funding package at schools like UCLA or even Columbia's Teachers College).

The link you provided is likely before taxes as that's the most common when measuring income since tax situations vary so much across circumstances. That puts the stanford stipend in the very low income. BUT that's also measured against the median family income, which breaks down really quickly when measuring for one person.

My peers and I have coded on a couple meta-analysis for either older students or faculty and I will say it is VERY time intensive. Do you have a general idea of how many articles you might have to code? Some areas might have 20-30 while others hundreds. The best thesis is a DONE thesis (unless at your school it\u2019s the same as a dissertation). So if you\u2019re under time constraints it may not be feasible to get all the coding done yourselves while also writing. \n\nBUT if there is a relatively small article pool it may be quicker than primary data collection as all your data is already there! So less could go wrong. \n\nAnother thing to consider is- has another similar meta been done on your topic in the last 10-15 years? If so you have very little chance of publishing a meta if that is a goal.\n\nA student in a program a couple years ago did a prospective meta for her dissertation and it got great reviews! Metas are more likely to get cited! So that can be a bonus. \n\nI\u2019d you work on it together would you both be able to use it for your thesis or only one and the other a second author on a pub?

It is only conducted if enough studies have the same outcome and were measured in approximately the same way (low heterogeneity) or it changes the model used for the meta-analysis and you must explain how you searched for and explained heterogeneity. (Very basic overview of this aspect).\n\n2) I would not undertake a systematic review without having the following members on your team: 1) expert in systematic review methodology, 2) librarian, 3) clinical/subject area expert. These people may not actually do any of the work (I.e. performing the screening process, data extraction etc) but you need them to ensure the quality of your work. If the quality isn\u2019t there, it will not be published or not in a high impact journal.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1) yes you can and probably should do a systematic review as part of your PhD project (with the right support - see my second comment)\n\n2) you should or would conduct a preliminary search regardless of if it part of the process of developing your protocol. It could be part of your literature review for your PhD.\n\n3) no, two phd students cannot handle this work alone (this is assuming neither of you have ever completed a systematic review but even if you have, experts are always welcome).

It's a lot of personal growth and independence. I think many of the struggles that people go through have to do with expectations not being exactly met. The PhD is not a jobs program, and it's hardly on-rails. *You* have to set out to make it what you want it to be. \n\nTypically, the best reason to do so has to do with clear intrinsic goals. Growth, learning, and possible future job prospects and fields are good ones to pursue.\n\nLikewise, standing behind what you're doing is sometimes lost in PhDs. This sort of happens with preconceived notions by candidates. But ideally what you stand behind is less a *project* and more *an idea*, at least that's the way I see it. You're *interested* in a project, but the project itself is not the mission.\n\nPerhaps ask yourself, what is it you want out of the experience? And what do you want to do with that goal?\n\nAs an example, I have a friend currently in a PhD program. He had been involved with research with his Masters for years, had started his own company and had success. But limitations have started to set in with his opportunity choices, and the PhD was a nice way for him to progress.

After that month, I started applying to jobs in earnest, and I got back to \"normal\" (all of this also happened early in the pandemic, so everything was shut down and we were all in quarantine so I never had a celebration of any kind, either).\n\nWhen my partner finished his Ph.D., he did pretty much the same. Played video games for a month and just let himself do all the things he had been avoiding while writing. He finally played Ghost of Tsushima, for example. It has now been two months since he finished, and he's easing back into work (he had started a bunch of articles that got sidelined as he focused on the dissertation) and applying to jobs.\n\nSo, I definitely don't mean to state \"One month is all the time you need.\" Some people need more, some need less. The point is, take as much time as you need. If you have any support people who can offer you more time by covering bills or the like, this is probably the ideal time to take them up on their generosity. The emotional and mental healing after a Ph.D. is no small matter. If you want to stay on academia, you need to detox a little first (my opinion shared by many but not all).

You cant be a professional athlete without motivation and joy (Although some rough days and shorter periods here and there should be expected).\n\nAlready in my 18 months at work, Ive seen people so stressed, so exhausted and so mentally down. Ive seen several quit their PhD. And Ive seen one recent PhD graduate quit his post doc cus he felt so off and like his work didnt have purpose (he lost all his motivation after he achieved his goal of getting a PhD). Some people push it way too far before they quit. I think that is a big mistake - not only are they wasting time they couldve spent doing something else, but some also waste their mental health which could take a long time to get back.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sadyan/recent_life_event_has_made_me_question_whether_i/htteli1/"}, "4782": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Revolutionary-Bet380", "Date": 1642898987, "Score": 2, "Body": "I think I have this question every day.

One important question: how stable and serious is your relationship? Like marriage serious or just causal dating. It matters more to me than my career because there will always be another job and another opportunity, and finding someone that you love is harder than finding a job. \n\nOn the relationship side: I was in a LDR for a year and it was a 2h flight plus 30min-1h to travel between the homes to the airports. It was manageable and affordable but still different than in person. I would visit one weekend a month but that left three weekends where I was away from my partner. After I stopped working on the weekends, it got really lonely and I really wanted to hang out with him, especially during the nice weathers. No amounts of daily video chats or friends and family hangouts would replace time that I spend with my partner. For this, I will always pick being with my partner. \n\nOn the PhD side, especially now that I am applying for biotech positions: don't be too focus on the content, focus on the soft skills that you will gain, including project management, team working, random technically skills, ability to solve problems, develop protocols, etc. For example, an ELISA done for cancer research will still give you the experience and ability to do ELISA for vector research, etc. During a seminar interview, the hiring manager told me to present on my research achievements and don't focus on the content itself, because they want to see how you can generate profit for them. Next, while it is important to look towards future jobs, getting the PhD is hard step too so you should focus on finding a good mentor with successful students than a gene therapy mentor. Importantly, I would never join highly successful PIs with huge IF papers and who are always on the front page of the university's website because I found that those PIs normally didnt have time for you, were socially difficult to work with, or had agendas to benefit themselves over your education/career. It is better to find a lab that you can finish asap even if you don't have the right experiences or skills, and then do a postdoc in academia or industry to make you more competitive. Just the pay difference between a postdoc and a grad student supports this idea. Finally, there are A TON more PIs that you will meet and interact with once you join a program than doing online search on your own. Other students will also give you an idea of which labs/PIs have supportive environments. Focus on finishing your PhD regardless of the content. Of course the content will give you a leg up in jobs but definitely not required. \n\nFor the biotech section: it's really hard to predict the hiring process 4-6 years from now when you graduate. Right now, there are jobs that require expert experience, just basic experience, or even no experience and they will teach you everything. I can also get jobs through my connections but I need to move to a specific city, so I couldn't use those connections. But connections are the key to getting interviews!!!!! Next, a scientist from a company that I interviewed for had only done antibody discovery research (I checked her LinkedIn) but recently changed to another company to be the team lead for AAV gene therapy. Random right? Not really because your ability to be a scientist outweighs the content itself in the biotech sector. It also varies if you are looking at small , mid, or large sized companies, where small companies are more willing to train you while large companies want you to be an expert on certain skills. This translates to pay differences, but anything will pay more than a grad school salary so focus on graduating asap. Don't stay around forever to be an expert in gene therapy or cancer research. For these uncertainties, I will also choose to be with my partner, but focus on forming my LinkedIn connections now.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/samfa0/looking_for_advice_on_where_to_do_phd_life_advice/htwrtvx/"}, "4876": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "McBonyknee", "Date": 1642962520, "Score": 3, "Body": "I mean, with how academia treats graduate students, isn't this the *intended* outcome?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sajans/im_a_grad_student_oh_where_do_you_go_villain/htwrumu/"}, "4877": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "al_the_time", "Date": 1642962594, "Score": 1, "Body": "I use notion.

But as a whole, I like the lifestyle of doing a PhD. The downside is the lack of money and competitiveness for funding. But I feel like I'm actually learning things (like attending faculty talks and presentations by other grad students in the department), and I'm working on a project that I get to call my own, even if it's niche and no one else care besides my supervisor. \n\nIf you're curious then perhaps you can do a Master's first to see if research is right for you? I know people who've tried it for a year or two, found that it wasn't for them, and then Master'ed out.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sbap8s/yall_ever_feel_like_you_wastedare_wasting_your/htz7woo/"}, "5017": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AlmostNever", "Date": 1642997990, "Score": 2, "Body": "PhD student, math, US.

Try talking to them about setting goals, measuring progress, and ask about a topic for your first paper and what action items need to be completed to get there. I've had to get pretty pushy about this with mine, because I'm a very low priority to them, and it's the worst feeling ever, but there are things you can do. I feel a lot more empowered about life in general after finally taking charge of the situation. For example, you can ask them \"I want to submit my first paper by this date, how can I do that? What topic makes sense? Who has done something similar? What methods do I use?\" And then keep in mind, that they'll probably forget you set that goal. So just keep reminding them and being as proactive as you can.\n\nI also suggest reaching out to other grad students who have the same supervisor and ask them how they got started with the research, how they make progress, and what systems they have in place to hit milestones.\n\nI also agree with the other poster - just do stuff. If you have something written up, then its way easier for people to give you feedback. I found I got help way faster by just writing up a terrible, crappy, wrong draft than asking millions of questions. If you have a write up of your background research, methods and eventually your results, then there concrete things they can pick at. And down the line when you feel comfortable doing so, if they still don't get back to you, then you can always list them as a co-author and threaten to send the paper off to a journal by a certain date.

I finished my PhD a few months ago, but have yet to do anything with it.  For me it was a combination of having tremendous difficulty throughout my program coupled with a horribly toxic PI, to the point where I feel traumatized from the whole endeavor.  I avoid looking at anything with my PI's name on it because it gives me anxiety and makes me feel a little sick.  The workload distracted me from being introspective, and now that I'm out it feels like I'm colliding with a wave of things I've been avoiding.  \n\nHowever, with all that being said, seeing that wave in front of me makes it more obvious what issues I need to resolve with myself in order to grow and move on.  I also have time to think of what I really want in my life, and the ability to be honest with myself.  Being free from the stress and distractions allows me to filter out all environmental noise, which is constantly telling you what you \"should\" enjoy, rather than what you truly enjoy.  \n\nI feel like a wet blanket as well, I'm getting over this wave at a very slow pace, but improvement is what's important, and everyone moves at different rates.  I think it's also important to realize that the burden of guilt feels a lot heavier than it actually is, and it's okay to tackle a problem in your own way, regardless if others would do it differently.  It's also equally important to be aware of forming bad habits, which can be easy when you go from intense workload to no workload.  \n\nSchool has a point of diminishing returns, to the point where it can actually inhibit growth and independence, due to its highly structured environment.  I think as PhD's, we've incubated in this environment for an extra-long time and are now being faced with similar decisions that our non-PhD peers have faced at an earlier stage in life.

BUT there was no way of knowing what they already knew. So, my work for my thesis and dissertation ended up being mostly scale/survey development. (Which is a BEAST, btw and still not \u201cdone\u201d, although my degrees are complete.)\n\nAll that to say, survey development/assessment/program design is one route to go (it\u2019s certainly marketable) in your health policy field. I\u2019m not in health policy specifically but both qual and quant are useful there. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for ideas but, I think info surrounding perceptions of health policy would be useful/interesting.

(If I say I am this kind of a person, but perceive the implications of a policy differently than my group\u2026what does that mean about me\u2026or them\u2026or the policy?)\n\nAnyway, I brought two potential ideas to my professors and they helped hammer it out with me.

For example, part of the paper I wrote for my theory course, ended up essentially serving as a draft of the theory section of my dissertation later on.

That is one thing that you do not skimp on. Be consistent with your sleep schedule and if you also need time within your day to take a quick power nap of some sort to benefit you for the rest of you day in terms of productivity, do so. \n2. **Create a Detailed Schedule:** You obviously know the next two weeks are going to be hell, with stress, sleep deprivation, and perhaps even \"imposter syndrome\" all being things you feel/experience during this time. Thus, to limit these feelings and maximize your productivity within this limited time window, I would really make a detailed schedule of (**1**) which projects need to be prioritized (from most to least) and plan accordingly, (**2**) determine which project will be the most difficult and time consuming (and plan accordingly), and (**3**) determine how many you want and can dedicate to working (hours per day) before productivity for you personally becomes counter-productive. I would make an outline with each project clearly labeled and bullets under each project that highlight steps or major aspects of that project that need to be covered/accomplished before you can determine that you are done and can move onto the next project. Sometimes, it helps to visually see the tasks you have in front of you and makes you feel 100x better when you're able to cross off a task that you completed each subsequent day. It makes you feel like you can accomplish this and you are making progress.\n3. **Make time for \"me\" or \"self-care\" time**: Even in the midst of a really tough deadline, you need to make time within each day for time that is dedicated to just destressing and relaxation. I make time to call my family (parents, sister) to talk with them at the end of the day to check how they're doing, and communicate with another human being. They know that they are my support system and that these calls mean a lot to me as a way to minimize daily stress. I also go on Youtube, go for walks, go run errands, online shop, watch sports, or just eat an amazing meal as ways to reward myself for working hard and injecting relaxation into my life. I also pick one day where I do no work at all, it is a day to completely recharge. That day is usually Sunday. \n4. **Manageable Work Schedule**: For me, I'm not able to work for long periods of time so I break up my work days into shorter chunks. If I plan on working for 8-9 hours, I'll break my work day into more manageable 2-3 hour work chunks and give myself an hour in between as a reward for working hard. I usually use those 1-hour breaks to watch YouTube videos, make a call, run errands, or go for a walk. Then I go back to working. As long as cumulatively, I've reached my expected number of work hours, that is all that matters. I also have a system where I alternate between \"heavy\" and \"less-heavy\" work days. On a \"heavy\" day, I may work 8-9 hours and on the \"less-heavy\" day, I may work \"4-5\" hours. I alternate back in forth between these days throughout the week.\n5. **Think of all the people who got you to this point in your life**: In my darkest hours of working on my dissertation, I had all sorts of tears, disappointment, imposter syndrome, and regrets on all the times I had wasted not making progress. I think what got me to get my head out of my ass is thinking back on my entire life (all the way back to elementary school on up) and thinking of all the important people that got me to this point and not wanting to disappoint them. I told myself that they believe in me so why the hell do I not believe in myself? I told myself that I've come too far to let these people and myself down and that I have to keep going. No one ever said the journey to the top was going to be easy, nor that the path to the top would be smooth. \n6. **Be kind to yourself**: Lastly, I think this last point is an important one. We have a tendency to be too hard on ourselves sometimes and we need to have the ability to step back, say we obviously made a mistake (perhaps with too many commitments, underestimating the time it takes to complete a project or meet a deadline) and just do our best to navigate the minefield. No point in putting oneself in a negative headspace, while attempting to complete so many stressful tasks. \n\nHopefully this helps OP, good luck, you got this!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/sb8yqm/how_to_keep_going_despite_burnout_any_tips/hu4ybbf/"}, "5342": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "littlephdthings", "Date": 1643107517, "Score": 8, "Body": "What happens if you say \"I want to be the first author for the paper that comes out of my data.\"?  \n\n\nAlso, is shared first authorship an option?

So if I need to re-work it, I need the *time* to re-work it, which means a cheeky suspension to pause the clock long enough...\n\nThere are two aspects to the problem: one is the emotional nonsense I am in, but the other is making sure this work demonstrates the research outcomes correctly in order that it functions as a coherent unit with the thesis. Being practice-based, it's not a case that the thesis is the 'real' bit under examination: the work itself is a core part of the exam, equally as important as the written element or the viva. It's currently not doing what it needs to: it's not an adequate demonstration of the research.\n\nI think I've gotten into such a tizz of a situation because I've known, somewhere, that this is the case. All the other life-factors have made me close my eyes, put my head down and run forward repeating \"I can make it work I can make it work\" without addressing *why* I am struggling with it so much. The problem is, essentially, that Zoom is backwards: my work is all about audience agency, but through having them watch a streaming show (that is fundamentally taking place elsewhere) their agency - their capacity to act - is dramatically limited. The better thing to do would be to get an audience (of any size, hell one person would probably work) inside a space, with any streaming content being streamed *into* that space. So the performance takes place where the audience are, and they can act upon it without mediation.\n\nIt's one of those issues that, the moment I stopped and thought/talked about it without pressuring myself to **do it right now**, the problem (and solution) are obvious.

So my method is, I get one marble every 30 minutes of pomodoro. Every two marbles (1 hour) I can take a 10 minute break. The study with me pomodoro 60/10 works perfectly for this. If I collect 8 marbles for the day, it's been a successful day. You can go over, but the baseline is 8 marbles (4 hours of work). I mentally pat myself on the back, and put a big fat X on my habit tracker (essentially a bunch of empty boxes for every calendar day). At the end of the day I empty the jar, and next day I start again. As my focus builds over weeks, I plan to increase my baseline number of marbles from 8 to 12.\n\nThis approaches productivity in several ways:\n\n\\- Constant feedback and feeling of progress (marbles)\n\n\\-  Momentum (habit tracker Xs)\n\n\\- Low expectations (4 hours of work on top 3 priorities of the day)\n\n\\- Accountability (Study with me)\n\n\\- Pressure (artificial deadline with a pomdoro timer)\n\nWith all these combined, with lots of trial and error, I found a way that I actually feel like I'm recovering from burnout, feeling like I'm winning, whilst also being productive.\n\nHope this helps brother!

You'll not have too many people in your life who care about what you do outside of your field.\n\nWho uses sustainability in public discourse the most?

It is quite the opposite - it is a too flexible term for people to use in a manner that suits their agenda. The sustainability of the allotment keeper is not the same as those of Shell.\n\nSustainability - surely! - looks at the world as a series of resources (you said it yourself) for consumption and attempts to apportion them 'better': the problem of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic that is avoiding the iceberg of climate crisis, all wrapped up in the liberal pieties of the day. Surely the issue is that world is much more complex and multifaceted than existing anthropocentrically a series of resources. It was here before humans and will be afterward, just existing for itself, life as life.\n\nAlso - what creates the biggest issues that prevent sustainability? Only a Malthusian would say over-population when it is demonstrable that the current global numbers have ample water and energy and food: only that they're being hoarded in the wrong places because there is no incentive (profit motive) to move them to the right place.\n\nAlso: if sustainability isn't related capitalist mythmaking then why do movements such as anti-consumerism and steady state (which respectively imply not partaking in capitalism, and not partaking in 'growth') have to exist as separate branches of the environmentalist movement?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/scf7b5/food_sustainability/hu76k34/"}, "5432": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Zestyclose-Pirate-63", "Date": 1643142311, "Score": 3, "Body": "After reading about the transition calls and people's experience with CSA, I decided to cancel my transition call.

In this sense, I think that it's impossible to read everything, which is the beauty of it in the end. \n\nMy advice is to take your time, reflect on what you read, write notes and your own thoughts and reactions. Reading mechanically or because you feel you have to, can be exhausting and can kill your passion for the topic you're researching.

Of course if the timer runs out and you haven't finished, you shouldn't just stop halfway through reading, but it holds me accountable to reading quickly and strategically. This also helps separate the A's from the B's- strong papers make their argument clear enough that you can understand their claims within that time limit, while a B paper, even if they have it mostly right, is probably harder to see the full scope of their arguments within that time limit. \n\n2) In my opinion, the biggest factor separating A's from B's is the extent to which students actually walk through and demonstrate understanding of the underlying logic of their argument.

Then they said that there was no difference in white point setting at different retinal eccentricities using this method but I thought their graphs showed large differences?

If it is not needed, e.g. you do not plan to go into academia or it is not needed for whatever industry job might want. Then you do not need to take it NOW.\n\nYou can always return to doing a PhD at some point, but here are some of the benefits of doing right after your masters:\n\n- you already have an offer. Make sure that it is a good one.\n- you are at your academic peak. Many of the things you have learned are most likely very relevant for your PhD and will be fresher in your memory. Not just knowledge about topics but also the act of writing amongst other things. If you get an industry job, some of these things might dull, and it might be a bit of a struggle to refresh some of these things.\n- life gets in the way: at late to post 20's many people start to settle down, e.g. marriage, children, house etc. This is a natural progression for many people, which might make it hard to return to doing a PhD. You might have a mortgage that you need to payoff and taking a salary cut to do the PhD might not be possible. Depends on how much you get paid as a PhD of course - I don't know what the salary is in Canada.\n- my personal opinion: there is truly no rush in life. I have friends who just graduated there master at age 28-29 and have landed jobs straight away. To some extent, I wish I actually took another gap year to travel the world and backpack again when I had the time and freedom. So in the end it does not matter when you do or when you finish your PhD.\n\nEdit: the reason why you should think about the first question, is because is not an easy job - it is 3 years of hard work. The way I would describe it is like having a one-man firm. YOU are responsible for getting the work done, which means that things are always going to be on your mind, and it feels like there is always something to do. It is not like a 'standard' 9-5.

This is a key element of PhD research that often trips up less experienced researchers (myself included). Your internal progress reviews are where your work is put under most scrutiny.\n\nOn forced co-authorship: A side effect of having coauthors that contribute (in any small way) into your work is that you gain credibility and exposure through their networks. More often than not, their names in the author list indicate endorsement of this manuscript, for better or for worse. One is less likely to scrutinise the work when it has had a lot of backing from a team of experienced researchers. And supplying the data earns you authorship credit if the data is closed source; however, this aspect varies from institution to institution, so it's done differently elsewhere. There might also be research grant agreements delineating who has publication rights to this data, meaning that the work may only be published with their permission (as a collaborator). \n\nBeing able to collaborate with highly experienced researchers in your field, despite the experience gap, is a hallmark of a budding researcher who can hold their own in a peer-reviewed academic environment, so it reflects well on you to have High-Profile collaborators at your defense. That being said, I do appreciate not wanting to give undue credit to someone else on your team where they don't deserve it. In any case, it's worth considering whether compromising to get the benefits (IMO) is a worthwhile tradeoff for you and your relationship with your mentors moving forward.

You can't prepare that much for the specific questions because you don't know what will come up, but I had some vague idea of what I would say if they pulled me up on any of the areas I was particularly weaker on. I brushed up a bit (literally an hour or two) on some key equations so I knew exactly how I arrived at each answer and conclusion. However, as you can take the thesis in and the equations are there, I didn't spend too much time on it.\n\nThat's about it. The day of the viva (or day before) will be one of the most stressful experiences of your life, just do whatever you can now to make yourself comfortable. What I did may be far too little for most people, but I didn't want to stress myself too much because I wanted to be relaxed as possible. However, if you intensely revising means on the day you will be more confident and relaxed (because you know it inside out) then that is good too! You wrote the thesis, you had a mock viva which went well and have publications, this is all good! \n\nGeneral tips: stay calm and composed, use bullet points or sticky notes for the key areas, practice the \"big\" questions.

Write about the family situation in your Personal Statement essay. This is a place to explain why your transcript looks wonky, why you took a long hiatus, etc. \n2. If you want to get into the top 40 schools, you need an extensive math background, like real analysis, and ideally solid research experience. Many of your competitors will have a double math-economic degree and economic research experience. Economics PhD is very math intensive and your first year will be difficult if you are not prepared. The stats background and working as a Commercial Real Estate Brokerage will definitely help you, especially since it looks like your interested in finance. \n3. Make sure you get solid recommendation letters from your Economic and stats professors.  Ideally, you did research for at least one of them. I think the manager for Commercial Real Estate Brokerage could be a great source since you created financial models! And make sure they look at your personal statement essay to provide feedback.\n\n4. Revise revise revise your CV/resume. You saying that you created financial models is not enough. Explain the complexity of it- for example, you used an asset pricing model to estimate or determine why blah blah blah (I'm not a finance expert). \n\n5. Apply to a wide range of schools. And also apply for RA positions. You can find a lot in @econ_ra in twitter and at nber.org called \u201cResearch Assistant Positions - not at the NBER\u201d or Federal Reserve Board internship. If you don't get into the schools you want, take one or two years to be an RA and apply again. I have friends who got into like top 20 schools by taking time to be an RA at a prestigious school/organization. Some of those friends previously didn't get into good schools or any schools.\n\n6. Go to your state school economic seminars to see what economic research is really like. Talk with the economic professors, talk with the econ Phd students. It's a different world from your undergrad classes. \n\n7. Also consider a Finance PhD because you definitely will make more money and you will have more individualized attention. However, I think Finance phd programs are harder to get into.\n\n8. I forgot to include this. Take time to think of your own finance research ideas and run them with your professors. This will really help your personal statement essay by showing that you have research potential. Second, take time to read economic papers written by professors in the schools you are interested. Bring those up in the personal statement essays so the committee can see why you want to apply and that your interests fit some of their professors\u2019 interests.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/seu81z/chances_of_phd_economics_acceptance/hulxqx9/"}, "5913": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jkflip_flop", "Date": 1643391901, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank you, I am proud of all I\u2019ve been contributing lately to the lab.

Can you take public transit and read on the way there? If you\u2019re exhausted after work it sounds impossible. \n\n2. Have your phone or computer read them to you\n\n3. Pomodoro reading? Or even less, say give yourself 10 minutes on an article and stop after ten. Take a 5 min break and go again. Build up your stamina.

Just a paragraph or one pager where you\u2019re trying to make some kind of argument.  When you hit a sentence when you need to start inserting citations, go find some articles on the topic and read for that sentence you need to write. Having a goal will help. \n\n5. Create a reading group with other students. Take shared notes. Make a deadline to talk about a group of papers on something. Agree not to feel guilty if you haven\u2019t read every single one. \n\n6. Abstract, graphs, next article, repeat. \n\n7.

This sucks but once you get the first position I'm told it becomes much easier afterwards. I've done an internship in my masters and man was that demoralizing. It felt like there weren't many jobs relevant to my skills and out of many applications I only got a few interviews. It was so close to the end of my school term I accepted the first position I was offered. I even had friends in my department say things like \"oh I was surprised when I heard you took *that* job...\", the implication being that this position is banal for a grad student. Fair, but hey man it's the first offer I got after months of applications and I was running out of time. The internship ended up alright, though I haven't applied to jobs since then so I can't guarantee it will be easier for me this time. But this is what everyone tells me. They also tell me that after your first entry level job your salary can double etc. My overall point is that what you're going through is ***very*** common and it should be easier the second time around.\n\nSecond is that sometimes academics don't know enough software that's used in the industry which means you might have a steeper learning curve which means you won't be as profitable when starting which hurts your chances. I don't know anything about the tools in your field but it would be a good idea to identify the specific technology skills employers are focusing on and maybe take short online courses on those technologies or do a small mini project using this tech and post it on GitHub. Having demonstrable skills in the specific software companies use can help a lot.\n\nThird is self-marketing. Part of this is that academic cvs aren't the same as resumes you would give to companies. I'm a grad student inexperienced with this myself, but I frequently consult my friends who *are* industry savvy to help me make a good cover letter. The biggest thing I learned is that companies likely don't care about your own interests or accomplishments, they *really* care about whether hiring you is profitable and justifies the wage you demand. So my friends in the industry helped me a lot with resumes and cover letters.\n\nFourth, I know some academics personally and have heard numerous stories of academics who have a superiority complex and it can show to potential employers. I was definitely over-qualified for my internship in terms of technical skills, but my perspective was *\"hey I'm the new guy and have no experience, so why should I expect* ***not*** *to be given the more boring work for the time being. Once I pay my dues with the boring stuff I'll get to move up to more interesting things.\"* Anyways my point is to be open minded and try to be likable, basically.\n\nI hope some of my incoherent rambling helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sf341q/regrets_about_getting_a_phd/hup5ct9/"}, "6022": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "unlocalized_finn", "Date": 1643447158, "Score": 1, "Body": "What went right?

I took a post-doc and I am staying in academia for at least a while and this is how I view the three categories;\n\n1) Mentally is the strongest area personally. More confidence and I genuinely love what I do. Rather than work all day every day on menial tasks with a horrible boss, I get to work on cutting edge technology in a great atmosphere on pretty much any topic I want. Also was in a nice PhD cohort and made some friends for life. \n\n2) I think that ties into social too (happier, good friends, more free time), but the downside is that you are essentially still a student into your mid/late 20s. All your friends have been in work for years but to you it's still new. To me that is the only negative socially.\n\n3) Financially I knew going to into a PhD was a risk financially and would set me behind my peers, but overall I am fine with that. To me, earning less is worth it for my mental health and for the experience and education. The financial impact actually may not be true long term, the potential is there for rapid promotion and getting up the ladder if that's what you want to do.\n\nDespite my overall net positive, I think it's important to say I that I hear you. The only practical advice I can give is sadly only a cliche, but comparison is truly the thief of joy. OK, you will be behind your peers financially for a while, admittedly possibly forever, and I understand that can delay the really important stuff (buying a house, starting family etc) but you have done something by obtaining a PhD that is a phenomenal achievement that money cannot buy.

Can you tell them that you're about to lose your shit, and you need them to pick up the slack so at the very *least* you can take a weekend off? Could you scoop up an undergrad (yikes sorry but yes that's an option) so they can ~~be at your service~~ get course credit, learn lab skills, and get experience? Make them do the grunt work so you can minimize your work time. If they're doing the mundane things, you can allocate your work hours to the important things. Then when you go home, you can spend time with your wife and be able to live your life. It's also very possible that taking an undergrad isn't an option, but it's something to consider if you can. \n\n\nWhat's your relationship like with your advisor? If you walked into his/her office and told them exactly this, and that you're so stretched thin you're going to scream, what would they say? Don't play anything down - it's so bad that you'd rather walk away then put up with it anymore. If they're not understanding, then... well. There's your answer.\n\n\nYes, you've put almost three years into this, but compare that to the agony of sticking it out for another year or two. Could you master out? Some schools have a credit-only option for a masters. That might be perfect for you. Also... don't brush off everything you've learned in the last three years. You're in a lab and perform maintenance on the equipment. I'm willing to guess that you know the operation and upkeep of those machines inside and out. Those are seriously  **valuable and rare skills** on a resume. Your average Joe Shmoe doesn't have the knowledge or skill to run this stuff and take good measurements. If you have papers published - remember that those won't go poof if you quit. Everything you've learned in the last few years - that knowledge is all yours!!! Nobody can take that away from you, and who cares if you don't get the piece of paper. \n\n\nThe way I see it, you can tell your advisor that you need a break. You could try to work with your labmates to find a solution and/or rope an undergrad into helping you. You can walk away for a short time, or you can walk away forever.

In any case, most research committees aren't going to consider materials exogenous to your application packet. Your gpa, rec letters, and research statements are the most important things in the application process. The best use of your time will be educating your references on what you want to do, where you want to do it, and why you're pursuing those options. They'll write better letters as a result. Communicating with folks from your target schools will also make you more familiar to the review committee.\n\nA last note: I'd personally recommend considering applying in the US. There's a lot of funding at US universities and they put a premium on building diverse student bodies. If you will be competitive in other international venues, you'll also be competitive here. Some of the top universities for CS are here. Others that aren't top 50 globally are still quite reputable and will have really good support.\n\nBest of luck in your applications.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sg6hae/will_making_stem_tutorials_in_youtube_make_for_a/huz3n6h/"}, "6383": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LordKrakenMist", "Date": 1643622377, "Score": 1, "Body": "Not what I wanted to hear, but what I needed.

Become your own wedding coordinator for a week and be a full-time wedding planner (if you can afford the time, of course).\nTalk to family and friends for tips on vendors. Knowing a personal contact at a venue, catering, pictures, etc. makes the communication so much easier!
