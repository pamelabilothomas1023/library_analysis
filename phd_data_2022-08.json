You pay them more than that, and it becomes an administrative issue, i.e. why is student X in Dr. Y's lab making $$ when everyone else makes $? The university and funding mechanisms won't be pleased. e.g. with NIH funding, you're not really supposed to pay them more than a set amount. Same with time off.

North Charleston, SC: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2017.\n\nLooking back, I think it would help me write more clearly and efficiently. It might be something you look into (as time permits) and pass on to other graduate students.\n\nHere's a summary I wrote for my advisor:\n\n&gt;\u201cZettelkasten\u201d is a German term that translates to \u201cslip box\u201d and is a system of note-taking that connects various notes or short pieces of information using numbering, metadata, or other file structures. Prominent sociologist, Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998), used a physical \u201cslip box\u201d that contained over 90,000 notes to produce more than 70 books and 400 manuscripts during his lifetime. Obviously, note-taking and organization are not novel concepts, but when combined with personal knowledge management software, such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), they become very powerful writing tools.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strength of this type of note-taking begins with a strong foundation of notes. Ahrens (2017) explains that when you takes notes, they should be written in your own words with purpose, pulling out only the main ideas and leaving the unimportant information aside. Because they are already written in your own words, they need only little work to be converted into a full article, manuscript, or book when combined with concepts from other notes. In short, do the bulk of the work up front, piece it together for projects, and make it look pretty afterward.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Several advantages exist when taking these notes in personal knowledge management software. First, your knowledge repository can be kept digitally and backed up in the cloud, allowing you to theoretically keep these notes forever. Next, some software allow for the use of links, tags, and other metadata to connect documents. These links and backlinks are helpful especially when your knowledge repository grows over time and the information in each document becomes difficult to remember. Obsidian allows you to visualize the connections between documents which may reveal larger themes, concepts, or research questions across multiple disciplines.\n\nTL;DR\n\n* Read this book: Ahrens, S\u00f6nke.

I don\u2019t have any interest in doing academia but I would ideally do the doctorate then bounce back into the biotechnology industry.\n\nIf you're starting a job in your field at 115k with huge benefits do you think there's a *reason* to be worried about eventually getting the PhD and/or limiting your growth? Sounds like the position on offer is one that can see you through for your entire career if it's stable and enjoyable, so unless you have reason to believe that position would not be long-term I'd take it and not look back.\n\nWorst case scenario you make bank a few years, the position falls through for whatever reason, but now you're more financially secure (presuming you spent/saved wisely in the interim) and are applying to programs with more years of industry experience and thus are probably going to be more likely to get better offers if you were productive during your years in industry.\n\nIf you're *very* set on the PhD *now*, I would ask the advisor to give you the honest likelihood of funding if applied for, and also ask to be put in touch with their current or recently graduated students to ask this and similar questions from someone who may be more in touch with the financial realities of being a grad student in this program. My program *technically* has it in their handbook they only guarantee funding for the first three years, but in practice everyone is funded their entire time, the school admin just doesn't want to put in writing that you are guaranteed funding somewhat indefinitely. If this is the case for this program I'd consider it much more favorable than if you actually have a true risk of not having funding in the long term. If you actually are at risk of not being funded, I'd not touch that with a 10-foot pole.\n\n(Also, 20k in a HCOL in general will be hard to swing for most unless you can live with your parents or something.)\n\nI'd definitely take the job if I were in your position.\n\nEdited to add: Also, while asking the advisor about the true probability of being funded, ask what support you will have from them or the department to secure additional funding.

It was due to all the covid restrictions but I want to let you know that if you're at a strong research led university then there's money. The doctoral college will tell you there isn't but there is - and usually this money is at faculty level. Of course there's no guarantee but finding the right people to fight for you should help. Maybe you can discuss this with your 2 supervisors that you get on with. Once you have their backing get them to involve the 3rd supervisor. That was my strategy. I really impressed on them that in the timeframe given getting results would be next to impossible. It took months but I finally got there. Anecdotally I know people that have managed to get an extra few months here and there in several departments, not covid related.

There are no exams, but you may have yearly evaluations with your supervisors. These are similar to yearly job evaluations. In our field, most PhDs are by publication and you will have an usual minimum amount of publications you should have in order to defend. Your supervisor should be the one guiding you in the writing/planning the publication steps, but be prepared to perhaps write a literature review in your first year and dive directly into data collecting. There are no courses as in a Masters/US PhD, but you will have to obtain some ECTS (could be by teaching, going to conferences, or doing trainings/workshops).\n\nThe style of your supervisor/PI will also influence heavily your trajectory I believe. For example, I hear typical dutch PIs give their students quite some freedom and encourage them to be independent earlier on. My PI comes from abroad, and has a much more micromanager style where most of the project ideas come from him or have to be approved by him.

The end goal is to produce a PhD thesis. The expectations of this thesis is that it consists of at least 4 publish*able* chapters. The ideal would be that all of these 4 chapters are published. In addition, the thesis needs its own introduction and conclusion(/discussion/outlook/whatever) chapter.\n\nSo that is your end goal to work towards. You have 4 years of research time to get there and no scheduled classes. I believe most PhD programs nowadays require you to get 30 EC (european credits) worth of courses, but those are pretty trivial to get. Trivial, but it is still important you actually do them by taking random 'general skills' classes and you can usually argue that a bit of your work is worth some credits.\n\nIn the Netherlands it is the norm for PhD students to be the daily supervisor for bachelor and master final theses, so it is likely you will have at least one of those. You may or may not have teaching responsibilities with your supervisor. You may or may not have other secondary responsibilities in the department.\n\nA lot of this is up to the individual project, individual department, and wishes of the supervisor.\n\nWhat is not up to the exact project is that in the Netherlands you have the full rights and responsiblities of a university employee. That means your pay is decent, you built up pension, you have PTO, vacation money (extra 8% of your salary) and a 13th month (additional extra 8% of your salary). It also means there is a certain expectation of professionalism, and you will have yearly performance meetings with your supervisor.\n\nSpeaking of, your first yearly performance meeting is replaced with a qualifier.

I did my master's here and my spouse did her PhD here. \n\n&gt;First, I believe I'll be making about 3215CHF per month\n\nYou'll be okay with this! It is quite expensive here but it's extremely doable. \n\n&gt;Swiss healthcare insurance premiums\n\nNo cheaper options for grad students, sorry. We looked for years with no luck. It's 300 plus and it doesn't cover much so be careful. \n\n&gt;I wanted to ask if any of you had experience applying for the family reunification visa.\n\nWe did this! It is a little bit time consuming but the Canton (local governments) are actually quite good about it. As long as you're married and have the paperwork, you'll likely be able to get the reunification visa without trouble. The process does take a little while though. Your spouse will be given a B permit (most likely), meaning they *may* be allowed to work as well. That's another tricky hurdle though! \n\n&gt;is it common for universities to support doctoral assistants' partners while they search for a job in Switzerland\n\nNo. I wish I had good news here but finding work in Switzerland as a non-eu resident is super difficult. I had a master's from a Swiss university, 5 years of management experience, and work authorization in my visa. After I applied to 300 jobs, I gave up and just looked abroad and found remote work. Switzerland is a very bad job market if you are not Swiss or European. This will be extremely tough. \n\n\n&gt;Lastly, how important is it to know German?\n\nNot that essential. You can certainly get by, however, the locals will appreciate it much more if you try to learn, even if your attempts are bad. A lot of people speak English anyway so you'll be fine.

Most of the time having journal publications is just an added bonus. Usually what has more weight is having previous research experience in the industry (like through internships or research placement) or even in academia (outside of your PhD such as graduate research assistantship). Doing an \"industrial\" PhD where you collaborate with industrial partners also has a lot of value too. Presenting your PhD research in a way that makes it appealing for the industrial role you are applying to can also do wonders. \n\nBut even if having publications is more valuable in your specific field, you don't have anything to lose by trying to apply to the jobs you want. I didn't get the feeling from your post that you would try to apply regardless, so I just wanted to comment to make sure you aren't going to let that stop you from at least giving it a shot. \n\nAlso if that can help, you don't have to wait until your thesis is submitted or that you officially have your diploma to apply to jobs. Start dates can always be negotiated and a lot of people start working when they are in their writing period, so it isn't unusual for companies to deal with. So if you are really worried about this, you could technically start applying now to find out if it's going to be an issue or not. If you land some interviews then it shouldn't be a problem. But if you don't, it doesn't necessarily mean it's because you don't have publications, it could be your resume that needs to be improved, etc. but that's another topic. What's also great about starting to look for a job before you are officially done with your PhD is that it gives you more time to find one without creating a significant unemployment gap in your resume.
