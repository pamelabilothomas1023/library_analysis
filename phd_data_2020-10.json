Something a lot of people don't consider is the opportunity cost of the PhD.  It really depends on the field, but just for example, I'll use the field my wife is in: UX design / research.\n\nShe has 5 years of experience and earns $160k US doing what she's doing.  She would likely increase her salary by around $20k immediately if she magically had a PhD right now.  Earning one, however, would take her probably 4 years and she'd earn maybe $30k a year from a graduate student stipend being a research assistant or something.  So yeah if she went back to school full-time she would take a salary cut of about $130k / year for the 4 years she's a PhD student ... so lets just round a bit and say that's $500k.  Assuming she would perpetually earn $20k more each year after having her PhD vs her not doing it, it would take 25 years of working to make up the difference.  Keep in mind this is using really round numbers and not taking into consideration inflation, appreciation of investments, taxes on income, real estate stuff, etc...  My wife plans to retire before working another 25 years in her field, so getting a PhD doesn't make sense financially.\n\nThere are MANY fields where the opportunity costs spent earning a PhD isn't worth it ... but there are quite a few fields where it is absolutely worth it or even mandatory to have the PhD to do much of anything in the field.

Some people leave because they realize they don't like the job, some people leave to start families, some relocate due to their SO, some retire, etc...

One of the two friends was in the same program as me and when she left, I just wished her luck and asked her to stay in touch, just like I would have if it were anywhere else I've ever worked.  There was nobody who was going to argue with her to stay, nobody making a big fuss.  You're an adult and if you leave you leave.  The other friend left his electrical engineering program to go work at an animal shelter because he volunteered there and it was the only work-ish activity that he said made him happy.

Without that, you need to think how you can show that you know what academic research in consumer behavior is, and that you have what it takes. \n\nThere is also another common issue for applicants that have been out of school for a long time: letters of recommendation. You are usually expected to provide 3 letters of recommendation from professors who can attest to your potential to be a researcher.

I mean they probably shouldn't be writing a proposal until they've been reviewing the lit for idk, like 4-6 months and have a good understanding on a theory/model/gap in knowledge and have an idea on how to investigate it.  Using their university library to look at the most recent doctoral theses in their specialty and see what they look like is a start too.  What does the published material in their area look like?  What methods have those authors used?  Or is this for somebody just writing a cover letter to say what they are interested in for a grad school application?  In that case, I'd say just read some of the recent things your target prof has written and have something intelligent to say about it and maybe say that they're interested in researching something that came up as 'future research needs to be done in this area' in the discussion section of one of those publications.\n\nTo answer how data is generated: business research is pretty broad and interdisciplinary.  I've read papers that use theoretical models and monte carlo simulations.  I've read stuff that model consumer behavior and cash flow like disease vectors where the models are based on systems of differential equations.  I've read meta-analyses of published literature and conference data.  I've read stuff that uses survey data, interview data, focus groups, corporate board meeting transcripts, oral history interviews, you name it.  I've read stuff that dredges decades of stock market data.  I've read stuff that involves the business researcher getting a phlebotomy license and taking blood samples from executive management employees to use cortisol levels as a proxy for stress along with self-reported diary data.  I've read literature that ran experiments with groups of employees.  I've read stuff that uses digital marketing data, corporate tax filings, audit history, company sales data, records of executive compensation packages, corporate electricity bills, hiring data, promotion demographics, web traffic, user data, user testing, eye-tracking software, A/B testing.  Basically anything and everything is used in business research.\n\nWhatever is necessary to answer the question at hand, be it quantitative or qualitative is how business research is done.  It uses much the same methods as STEM and also social sciences (sometimes both in mixed method research) just depending on what tool is right for the problem.\n\nKnowing your friend's specific area of business would be helpful too.  There are some areas of business that closely resemble psych research (HR stuff and things like motivation, stress, leadership).  There's stuff that is more philosophical like ethics, governance, social, environmental responsibility.  There's some pretty technical stuff when you get into quantitative finance; like a lot of that is super similar to what astrophysics PhDs do.

If you aren't comfortable going into details of your situation that is fine, but I certainly wouldn't consider it \"unprofessional\" to do so. I think that is mostly up to your comfort level and what you want to disclose. As you start that conversation, also start scoping out where you might want to land.

I accepted a postdoc before my dissertation was complete. I had actually just proposed it. That gave my Christmas break and spring semester to finish. My advisor had already left the school and moved to a time zone 8 hours ahead. We could only meet on zoom 1 hour a day first thing in the morning, we did this weekly. I had no real support. \n\nI ended up working from dusk until dawn every single day of the week, skipped Thanksgiving, Xmas, everything, a friends wedding, every moment was devoted to that paper, and the one class I taught weekly.\n\nThings started getting bad when I was writing the discussion, things got convoluted. My partner was very supportive, ironically she is a therapist. One morning over our 5 minutes of talk and coffee before she left for work and I sat in our office cramming away, she said: last night was a bad one huh? I said what?m, did it storm? She said, no, your night terror, I think you woke up the neighbors, is your foot okay? \n\nTo my surprise she explained to me that I had been waking up and screaming and running and jumping around howling. She thought I knew, I had no idea.\n\nI developed a rash on my hand it one point, thought it was from constantly sweaty palms. Turns out the chronic stress hormones lead to an egzyma outbreak on my fucking palms that peeled layers of my skin off, leaving my palms bright pink, with red dots and all wrinkly. Was told this would not resolve itself until my stress decreased. It was so bad I heard my favorite student defending me to a classmate who made up a nickname for my disgusting looking condition. I was constantly ashamed on my 3 hours out of the house every week, then in pain the rest. I could hardly type without it hung or bleeding. My keyboard ended up tinted pink from the blood of months of this. \n\nI knew I was destroying myself. But I had made it so far, sunk cost maybe? Maybe I just wanted to complete a promise I made to myself. All I knew was, in my darkest hour, with everything looking bleak. I knew I would never do this to myself again. I had found rock bottom, I knew I needed to do what I had to and never do this to myself again.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this helps you, but I can promise you this.

In astro/phys there are very few terminal master\u2019s degree programs, and generally the people who go to them either couldn\u2019t get into a PhD program, or they are staying at their undergrad institution and tacking on a coursework-only master\u2019s. PhD programs are the norm, and admissions generally comes with a teaching assistantship that waives your tuition, comes with student health insurance, and also has enough stipend to barely live on. You pick up a coursework Master\u2019s (MS) along the way to the PhD. If you wash out of the PhD program (usually based on comps or quals tests), you can generally finish the same coursework as the PhD students and then get a coursework Master\u2019s. Some few of these students choose to write up the research they\u2019d been working on so far into a thesis and then get a thesis Master\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019m also familiar with the education field. EdD\u2019s are usually for programs that focus on research applied to your K-12 school\u2019s administration, and as such are usually taken by K-12 teachers with a MEd who want to become administrators, while PhD\u2019s are usually for programs that focus on more pure research and are often but not always teachers changing course. The MEd is a practical degree, and is part of teaching certification, and is neither required nor directly helpful towards either the EdD or PhD in Ed, even though many of these students do have the MEd. \n\nFor physics/astro, going from a Bachelor\u2019s to a PhD program is just like taking even harder courses, requiring even more self-motivation, and then adding being a TA on top of that. Note that while as an astro/phys undergrad you\u2019ll generally take 4-5 courses per semester, 8-10 per year, as a grad you\u2019ll take only 2-3 per semester, 5-6 per year, and it\u2019s still more work than undergrad.

That's amazing!' from people outside of academia too often, hence I was slightly triggered by this post.\n\nYeah, I definitely understand that! My parents used to do it all the time because we're they're from, it's weird to even graduate high school, so they'd never heard of a \"PhD\" before and just assumed it was \"more school\". I try to make sure I present it in \"work\" terms, so I talk about being a candidate instead of student, my boss/supervisor instead of my PI, my salary instead of scholarship.\n\n&gt;But aren't you gonna publish the data in affiliation with your university and PI?\n\nWell, kinda, but I'm first author and any paper I publish after officially graduating won't have my PhD affiliation on it, it'd have my postdoc affiliation. It's just an address so people can contact you. I work with people all around the world, from all different institutions, on an ad-hoc basis. My university doesn't own the work of someone in a completely different university. They also don't own *my* work. I explicitly retain intellectual rights to it all. Also, my projects are designed by me, and I choose my collaborators. I work on projects that don't involve my PI at all.\n\n&gt;You, on the other hand, are already highly qualified. You must have at least a bachelor's, probably even a master's degree. Why do you view yourself as equivalent to an apprentice?\n\nI also have certificates in retail, so should I be paid a bonus for that? It's a qualification - the highest you could get in that specific area. \n\nI think \"qualified\" is a meaningless term without the context. Sure, I have Bachelors degrees in other subjects and so I'm \"qualified\" for whatever jobs I could get with a Bachelors in those subjects. But I'm *not* qualified, and certainly not *highly* qualified, to be a professor or full-time researcher in my field. Absolutely not. My qualifications in unrelated careers (there is no industry for my field) are totally irrelevant. In terms of a research career, my Bachelors degree is only a tiny slice of my training, just like high school and primary school.\n\n&gt;In my rosiest dreams, I think universities should pay closer to entry-level graduate jobs, bevause thats the people they're actually hiring.\n\nI don't believe I'm an employee. Not in the full sense. I wasn't hired. As I said, I don't have to teach and I don't work on anyone else's stuff. I design my own projects and work on them in my own time with whoever I choose. That certainly isn't a very efficient way to contribute to the university's profile (compared to a research or teaching assistant), so if I were to be an employee, I'd be the biggest leech around. I'm also not paid by my university though, so I'm more like a freelancer who relies on investment, fellowships, etc. Given that I'm unqualified to be a researcher and will almost certainly go somewhere else for a postdoc (i.e. no return on interest for my training), my pay is really shockingly good.\n\nBut I'm good with not being a full employee.

Are you in the US?\n\n\nI didn't apply/send emails to positions which demanded scholarships - because I knew I would never get it with my grades.\n\n\nInstead search for institutes or institutions where you can go work for a salary while doing your research.\nAt least a lot of them work like that here in Europe, especially Germany.\n\n\nI got into Max Planck and I'm working full time for my salary, while doing my PhD. \nTry to avoid the scholarship stuff if possible.\n\n\n\n&gt;Also, my line of work for the past 2 years were in manufacturing but my interest are in material science.

Yes yes yes.\nHOWEVER\nI wrote my masters thesis on genetic recombinations and I was highly interested in that field. \n\n\nThe spot which opened and in which I got offered a PhD is NOT recombinations, but other chromosome problems in cell divisions. It is close to what I was interested in, but not exactly what I wanted.\n\n\nBut I said fuck it, it would be stupid of me to be focused on just 1 specific thing without getting to know other things around it. \n\n\nSo definitely write what are your best skills and all knowledge you got/have from the area what you worked on, and explain why you would like to change topics. It just shows that you want to learn a lot and not focus on only one thing, and this versatility in science is a good thing to have (at least in my opinion).\n\n\nIt can only help you down the road, if you know a lot of things from related topics/subjects.\n\n\nAnd in the end, if someone sees your potential, he wont care about your references or grades.\nNot all supervisors/lab leaders are the same, but there are some extraordinary and a bit whacky guys.\n\n\nMy invited me for an interview, we clicked immediately and talked for hours and hours for 3 days straight.

You dont have to put references in emails if you dont have them. Some people will ask you for them, if they are interested.\nStart small, and start slow, but just start.

I know that I am going to get my PhD at this point, I can see the end, I know I am capable of finishing this, which are all things that I didn't have at all at my low points. But even so, the stress definitely brings up many of those same feelings of incompetence, burnout, paralysis, panic that I had during those times. All that to say that yes, this is one of the most stressful times for most who get their PhD, but I think that it is further exacerbated by having already had to have dragged yourself through hell to get there.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your ankle, that sucks and dealing with a cast is rough. I know that I cry frequently over any minor inconvenience right now, and I think it's really understandable that a big challenge like that would feel completely overwhelming. Especially when it makes it harder to engage in relaxing activities.\n\nI don't really have any great advice since I am struggling in the same boat- as I write this I feel mostly okay but I know that I will have more breakdowns in the days/weeks/hours to come before I finish.\n\n* I am trying to put off or delegate tasks that don't help me get closer to finishing, though this may not always be possible. I've accepted that the house will be a mess for now\n* Now that I am weeks away I am trying to determine realistic deadlines for each component by working back from the defense data (i.e. final dissertation to committee by X, which means chapter 2 draft by X, chapter 2 results section by X, MUST finish code/analyses by X).\n   * This lets me come up with a solid to-do list each day that makes enough necessary progress to finish on time BUT also means that I can stop for the day if I finish those tasks- it's really key to try to find a little downtime each day and I've been having an easier time with it when I know that I have set and achieved reasonable goals\n   * The timeline may not be super realistic, I know I will definitely be writing good chunk of my dissertation in tears while pulling an all-nighter before a deadline, but my chapters are going to be publications that I'll be revising/submitting after defending so the dissertation just needs to be written but not perfect (I think you're also in a STEM field?)\n* I am letting myself feel all the emotions and not judging myself for it. This is thanks in large part to therapy- I am acknowledging that anxiety and depression suck and finishing a PhD sucks and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. This also means recognizing when my emotions mean I need a break/am pushing too hard. The panic can make it feel like I need to push harder because it's screaming at me that I have only weeks to finish everything, but it actually usually means that I may need to step back and eat/rest/think about something else, or at least go back to setting/assessing reasonable goals to know what small step I can take towards finishing\n\nSorry to ramble on, I just am glad to hear from someone in a similar position.

The course was mainly about finding out what parts in your life are the most important to you and to set (small) achievable goals to find your happiness in life and work. I want a stable, secure, and nice paying job to be able to do the things I love to do.\n\nWhat crushed me the most about the PhD is the low income.

I think this is possible because my friends outside of academia are supportive and I've made allies within my cohort. It's not a \"trade\" for real life, just a different lifestyle that has its unique pros and cons. If you feel that it's \"selling your soul,\" it may not be for you.

I'm tired AF sometimes, especially because of Zoom/current circumstances, but I don't have any regrets so far.\n\nIn my opinion, your happiness during a PhD is largely dependent on whether or not you enjoy research, your relationship with your advisor, and the academic community.\n\nIf you're really worried about this all, if you apply, make sure the professor and grad students have a healthy sense of work-life balance. Happy grad students exist (at least in CS/HCI), and some students have a side hustle as consultants or do summer internships. Engineering tends to give the most in stipends (27-30k in SF and in NYC), which is liveable to pay rent that's $1500/month. \n\nIn regards to studying, I also barely go to my classes and only take classes that are in service of my research.

RIP your life. Others are quite chill and let you work on your pace unless there is a deadline coming up.  \nMy PI was generally chill, but my colleagues tended to gossip when someone left \"too early\". So there can be peer pressure from other people, too.  \nI also spend unnecessary overwork following the general culture of academia. You know, the usual bullshit you tell yourself to justify overworking: it'll benefit your career and if you are not willing you aren't serious and overall it's speed things up down the line so it's worth the extra work now. Looking back, I don't see that my overworking gave me a lot of benefits. I still didn't finish all experiments in time to get a proper publication out of my PhD, I could graduate without publications, so taking a tiny bit longer got not spending way too many weekends in the lab wouldn't have changed a lot. And me working more then 8 hours was way too often me not working optimally and taking too long breaks (e.g. because one of the very talkative colleagues chatted me up for 1h+) or getting caught up in procrastination to avoid hard tasks. I definitively could have worked smartest and be more strict about my work-life balance but was too \"inexperienced\" to know how to do that.\n\nLastly, your character and life circumstances are important.

My PhD had many triumphs, and many more tribulations. It showed me the best parts of myself and my darkest days. Sacrifices were definitely made to get the PhD done despite doing everything to maintain a work-life balance (which I feel I did a decent job at comparatively to many of my peers) and it took a toll in nearly every aspect of my life; health (mental and physical), financial, personal relationships, and life experiences. \n\nI started my PhD at the cusp of 23 years old and was fortunate enough to do my PhD in the city I grew up in, so I maintained most of friendships and support groups during this time. But apart from travelling overseas, I don't feel like I \"missed\" too much that can't be done at some other point in life. Writing up in the final 6 months coincided almost directly with the Covid lockdown in Australia so during those 6 months there wasn't a lot I was missing out on, anyway. Relationships with supervisors, funding, working remotely etc. will all alter the PhD experience.\n\nI am moving into industry/government, and I think what helped me push forward was not sacrificing *everything* in the name of academia. I learned early on that writing papers brought me little joy and was not where my work ethos and career ambitions were, so I used that to direct my experience. I also have a freelance business on the side of my PhD that prevented me from getting my identity too caught up in the thesis, which was really important. Learning to treat it as a job - where possible - was crucial, however it was difficult with deadlines and things. Academia is a field where it is tough to put the tools down and call it a day.  But PhD or not, I am an adult and should experience life as such. I took time off to go to friend's baby showers and weddings, to travel regionally, to grieve at funerals, to party, to have date nights with my partner, to indulge in hobbies. If your PhD supervisor or boss is preventing you from doing these things, you find a new one.\n\nSo in short, I enjoyed aspects and loathed others in my PhD. And while I regret starting my PhD, I don't regret finishing it (if that makes sense). I now use the PhD experience as a learning process for personal growth that will help direct me in life (and to avoid working on projects that intensive and long-winded ever again). I am now the most resilient, independent and perseverant version of myself, but it was a gruelling, convoluted and almost unnecessary process to get there.

PhD isn't a general education to make you a great fit for a wide range of jobs. PhD research is to train you to become an independent researcher and my PhD did just that. \n\nI disagree with your view on what PhD should be like. Note that after PhD there are tons of job opportunities BUT whether someone will actually be selected and thrive heavily depends on that person's talents and their interest in going into that line of work. Generally you won't be a strong candidate for all potential jobs simply because no one is going to be talented enough for all these jobs. With my STEM PhD I could have gone into technology consulting, train to become a patent lawyer, work as a lab technician, scientist in pharma, science writer, work and train to become a secondary school teacher, become a tutor, data scientist, analyst, work as an editor, and probably dozens more jobs. So there are plenty opportunities out there but during your PhD it's up to you to hone in on the ones that match your talent and ambitions and to position yourself as a strong candidate for that line of work. During my PhD I volunteered for student societies and got some experience in editing and writing, and also did some writing for other outlets. These things helped me get into my current career in which I am a writer. People who would want to go into teaching would generally do some teaching during their PhD to see if they like it, and that experience sets them apart from others who did little to no teaching, making them stronger candidates for a teacher training role. It's not up to your PhD program to position you for roles that aren't in academic research, that's fully up to the PhD student themselves and there are plenty opportunities to do so.\n\nThere is already equality of opportunity and as a foreigner from a working class background (but from a rich country) I've managed to secure offers for several amazing PhD opportunities. I got those because I applied, my undergraduate and master's were a good match, and because I had some extra research experience abroad (fully funded by my then supervisor). And I really knew what I wanted and read up on it before applying. These things are accessible to anyone from within the EU provided you went to university.\n\nOh, and about jobs: my university where I did my PhD has an annual job fair. They also have a career service with so many resources that you can keep using after graduation. Maybe other unis offer less, but in the end it's up to you as the PhD student to make use of what's on offer. I also went to a Nature careers fair towards the end of my PhD and went to a career's fair in my city organised by the council. \n\nAs a PhD student you are an adult and should take full responsibility for your career progression.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jaq437/how_do_we_fix_phd_and_postdoc_training/g8s5u1z/"}, "1165": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Kattlo", "Date": 1602669049, "Score": 9, "Body": "Hey, congratulations on getting to your thesis defence!

My background is biology and work in stem field. I think PhDs have too much Dr. in it and lacks philosophy in its formative process. As people working in academia we should discuss our own definitions, especially our methods and purpose. As someone mention, doctoral programs objectives are mainly to train you to become an independent researcher, if that is true why postdocs needs sponsors then? and it's not enough with your PhD to have a contract?. Well things are well more complicated that that, and there is a history about this. A lot of todays professors didn't do a postdoc, those don't even exist at that time, PhD work mainly in academia and the main purpose of academia isn't just being independent researcher, we can agree (hope so) that academia is way complicated than that, it includes higher education process (education in a deep meaning), training in multiple skills, impact society, etc. I've seen a lot a well qualify, talented and with high sense of commitment people break them self's for all the frustration that seems to be natural within academia. That should goes to an end, not just because is unhealthy but also because it's pushing out a lot talented people that can contribute significantly.\nHow can be fix, or better said, develop a new type of academia that makes people commit with it and vice versa? I don't have the answer, but I believe that we can start by some easy things: i) stop taking about doctoral process as kids being educated, as grad you are an adult and you are working for an academic/research institution. ii) stop pretending that postdocs have any formative objectives, you are a independent researcher giving your professional service to an institution.\nThat implies that we need to change the perspective that grad student can't do much, people are capable of many things and it's our responsibility to build the environments to them to flourish (especially for people with a formal bond with academia, professors mainly).\nThere is a lot more to discuss, but I hope it estimulante a nice conversation.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jaq437/how_do_we_fix_phd_and_postdoc_training/g8skcy4/"}, "1181": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Kattlo", "Date": 1602682454, "Score": 2, "Body": "Hmm that does sound difficult.

The pandemic has been a serious mental toll on all of us, there has been substantial change to our lives, our families, our social, physical and mental wellbeing, how could that not impact ones \"productivity\". You can't be expected to just take everything home, upend a huge part of your life, battle with the mental ramifications of the pandemic and just keep on working away with the same level of work as before. Your feelings of apathy and lethargy are completely valid and they are not 'your fault'. \n\nThat's just my thoughts on it, suppose it depends on your relationship with your admin/head of dept/funding body and how you go about requesting an extension. If I were you I would appeal to those closest to you on the admin scale, supervisor, head of school or whatever and see if allowances can be made in light of time and work lost due to the mental health ramifications of the pandemic. I wouldn't say that you need the time to do extra cirricular stuff like grants and that, just focus on making up for lost time. Depending on how large your funding body is also, they may find it deep within their pocket hearts to throw you an extra few months funding.

Some have even refused to put attention into their classes, either due to their own lack of comfort with technology, or the feeling that the university has abandoned them and so they don't want to fully participate.\n\nIf there is anyone else in the department that you are close to, I would try reaching out to them, explain the situation, and ask for advice.\n\nAlso, how long has it been since you sent the proposal that you are waiting for a response? I will say but at the PHD level and it's not uncommon to wait 3 weeks to a month for a response.\n\nIf it has been over a month, and you don't feel there is anyone else you can talk to, then I would reach out to the department chair. Explain your situation, and that you really want to continue your progress, but that you can't until your advisor gets back to you.\n\nI hope that helps.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jeu6gc/how_to_handle_you_advisor_not_returning_emails_us/g9gec5j/"}, "1713": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "GalwayGirlOnTheRun23", "Date": 1603216705, "Score": 2, "Body": "I use endnote web version so I can log in anywhere and I keep an excel database with notes/keywords on the key papers.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jeo5i2/referencing_tools/g9geffw/"}, "1714": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PhDtoJD", "Date": 1603216989, "Score": 11, "Body": "I guess this could depend on your field and your department, but my understanding was that generally your advisor won\u2019t even let you submit unless you\u2019re going to pass.

But my supervisor was terrible at answering emails, so here is how I dealt (or tried to, didn't always work) with it: \n\n\\- I stopped asking vague questions if they were important. And by that I mean that if I needed feedback, I didn't say things like \"let me know what you think\", or \"I would love to her your feedback\" or stuff like that. I would still include phrases like that whenever I sent him drafts for example, just to be polite, but knowing that he would never answer. Instead, if I actually needed feedback on something, I would ask for a meeting (first in person, these last months over zoom). Those emails he would be a bit better at answering, my guess is because it's easier to send an email saying \"yeah, let's meet on Tuesday\" than writing down feedback, so he would be more inclined to actually answer. Then any important feedback could be discussed face-to-face\n\n\\- with anything urgent, I would say I needed it quickly (while still being polite) and why. So in your case, I would say something like \"I would like to meet as soon as possible to discuss my proposal/I would love to hear from you as soon as possible what you think of my proposal so that I can start moving forward with the project\" or something in that vein. That seems to sometimes help to get him to actually respond if it was something important.\n\n\\- I figured out that he would often answer emails that were sent first time in the morning. I think it's because he tends to start his day by checking emails, and so there would be a higher chance of him actually responding right away, instead of my email getting lost in his inbox. This obviously won't work for everyone, but might be worth a try\n\n\\- I would send follow up emails, depending on the urgency. So if it wasn't very urgent, I would follow up maybe one or two weeks later, sometimes a few days, and if very urgent the very next day. I always stayed polite (think more \"I'm contacting you to confirm that you got my last email\", then reiterate wt it was about and why it's important for him to answer, not \"why didn't you answer yet??!\"). That often seemed to help him realize I actually needed an answer, or remind him that he still had to answer me\n\n\\- I learned to rely on him as little as possible, be independent, and find other sources of feedback. I still sent him drafts and proposals, with a mention that any feedback would be appreciated, but it was more to keep him in the loop on what I was doing than a way of getting actual feedback (again, when I needed feedback from him, I knew it would have o be face-to-face in a meeting). I know that this isn't an actual tip, and not the way it should be, but it was the reality for me when writing my dissertation with an absent supervisor. Also, I realize that there are some things that you still actually need your supervisor for, you can't just ignore them altogether, but relying on them a bit less was helpful for my stress levels.\n\nI don't know if any of these things would be helpful in your case, I don't your supervisor. This was just my experience in dealing with someone who doesn't answer emails. There are probably better tips out there, and better ways to deal with it, but maybe something in there will be helpful for you.\n\nI wish you all the best, I know how frustrating it can be.

Do you want to learn about everything in your field? That's an understandable goal, and one that I wanted to do too, but I'm going to tell you right now that you are setting yourself up for disappointment so you don't waste 6 years crying over things you don't understand like I did. Trust me, your notes will get soggy and then you will cry more because you can't read them (or keyboard? I honestly don't know what you do)\n\nDo you want to get really good at this one thing in your field because it is cool? That's an awesome strength of yours to pursue that because a lot of people will get frustrated and quit. You will see a lot of that. And if you get frustrated and realize this program isn't where you want to be in life, that's okay too. No one should be pressuring you to do something that you don't want to do, unless you actually do want to do it and they are supporting you. Let them cheer you on and be proud of you so that you don't spend 6 years being miserable and yelling at people who love you. I'm glad I was surrounded by people who loved me more than my hateful words because in hindsight that was unnecessary. But you can also learn how to do cool things at a job that gives you more money.\n\n\nLook around. Are you intimidated by a lot of people around you? Good. You are now surrounded by people who are really good at thinking and solving problems in a way that is different than yours. If you realize this early enough to not alienate people and instead 1) point out a quality about them you admire AND 2) ask them for help doing things you struggle doing, chances are they want to help you. And if they don't, that's their problem and you can find someone else who is less of a jerk.\n\n\nThe way I see it, you are here to learn how to think in your field better. And your way is probably not enough to get you through a satisfying project in the amount of time you have. And if it is, you aren't being challenged enough. Grad school is the one place on earth that has a collection of people who are really really good at thinking one way or else they wouldn't be there. You are one of those people. Notice how you think and how the people around you think. And apply that to your work to see if it helps you or not. Working with people is always more efficient and gets you farther than working by yourself. \n\n\nOh and it sounds like you picked an advisor who wants to help you succeed instead of adding to his CV. You did one thing correctly already. Tell him if you don't like your project and what you would rather do instead if that is an option. Or if it's not, ask him for help understanding why he wants you to do that project and why it's interesting to him. Ask this nicely because he might see something you dont. Everyone is better at working on things that they find interesting. So make it interesting for you.\n\n\nTL;DR: realize early that grad school is actually about your own personal growth so that you have more time to do things you love doing.

Remember that grant writing is a skill like any other, and needs to be practiced - it's not surprising to encounter rejection, especially if you're unused to writing these grants. I would send out your application to mentors and peers to see if you can get any feedback on how to improve your framing. Second, I would also not view smaller grants as being \"not worth it\". The tri-agency funders are lazy in that they prefer to fund people with a previous track record of grants, because those are the people they view as most likely to be successful with their grant money - it's common that if you get an NSERC URSA in undergrad, that rolls into an NSERC CGS-M for your masters, which in turn rolls into an NSERC CGS-D for your PhD.

The outcome of a PhD is a researcher capable of doing largely independent research. As a result, the element that is the most important is the ongoing mentorship with the supervisor while conducting the research, which is the element you seem to minimize in lieu of material, when in practice the amount of material required to conduct a PhD is pretty limited.

Nothing stops anyone from doing that already. If you have the natural talent to do independent research and get it published, then you don't need a PhD. Just do the work and get it published. If for some reason someone is hung up on having the title, then I can all but guarantee that if you have several published works as a sole author in high-quality venues, then you will have \\*no\\* problem being accepted into a PhD program, and will graduate very quickly.\n\n2 - Part of what you're saying seems to be that people should be able to do science on their own as a pastime.

I went to two therapists, one a general one and the other focuses on cognitive behavioural therapy. My general therapist advised against pursuing a PhD, my CBT said to go for it. The reason my general therapist was against it because I hadn\u2019t been on antidepressants that long, so she feared I wasn\u2019t in a stable mental state yet.\n\nI openly communicated about it to my supervisors. They admitted they were a bit worried for me to crash and burn and to not finish my PhD. I told them I am actually more equipped than the average person to handle all the stress. This because of 1. I took an awful lot of therapy in order to be more robust against stress and setbacks 2. I know what it was like to be in the deepest mental state possible and I do NOT want to end up in there again 3. I now recognise warning signs of mental problems early on 4. I still regularly go to therapy so if problems arise, we can immediately work on them 5. Social anxiety therapy learned me to openly communicate about my problems so my supervisors will always know when I am struggling, so we can find a solution together before things get even worser\n\nWe are now a year later. Corona hit and at the same time I was put off of my antidepressants. I have to admit this was a difficult period, but I applied again everything I learned in therapy and managed to pull through. So I would definitely tell someone with mental issues to pursue a PhD if they really want to go for it AND if their mental health issues are more or less under control (the focus of a severe depressed person should first be on getting better, not on getting a PhD). I would also tell them it is **very** important to have a therapist which they regularly go to because they will definitely need it. You have to be vigilant to not slip back into worse times and a therapist can provide a clear, unbiased look for that. I would also recommend to talk with your supervisor over it just because they know what they are getting into, also because they can help when they notice you are hitting a rough patch. And a personal motivation of mine to tell my supervisors was to break down the social stigma that is still on mental health issues.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jixsz0/role_of_mental_health_problems_in_starting_phd/gad6ida/"}, "2445": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "gwh34t", "Date": 1603880824, "Score": 2, "Body": "Not at all.

I've finally gotten to a place where I am able to move forward and make meaningful progress.\n\nThings that have helped:\n\nSwitching jobs to a position that is more aligned with my research interests and allows me to do a bit of double-dipping of work.  Previously, I was working a job that took all of my energy and was only very tangentially-related to my research interests. I used up all of my mental energy at work and had none left for school by the end of the day, which led to pretty much no progress for a couple of years.\n\nHaving a faculty member who occasionally checks in and to whom you can be open about the challenges and struggles you're facing.  For me, it was very important that this person wasn't all \"Wow! You have so much on your plate. I don't know how you do it all!  I couldn't imagine being in your shoes\" and instead was more \"Wow.  That's a lot.  No wonder you haven't gotten anything else accomplished. Here's some resources and supports that have helped me/others in the past. Use them if you want. I get it if you can't.  I'll reach out occasionally, but I won't bug you too much.\"  For me, this person was not my advisor, just a faculty member I click with and who seems to get \"real life\" better than others in my program do. \n\nBeing okay with mediocrity. I was always the best.  I am by no means the best anymore.  And I'm mostly okay with that. I'm good enough. \n\nThings that really didn't help:\n\nOvercommitting myself to projects that were good opportunities but required extra work on top of what was required by coursework and my own stuff. \n\nHaving no real advisor to speak of because my program doesn't automatically assign part-time students to anyone other than the program director.  I went almost a year without any contact from my program. At one point, I decided to just wait and see how long it'd take them to remember that I was still a member of the program.  It took about 11 months before I got an email from the program director checking in. She was my advisor of record at that point. \n\nPlanning to do my schoolwork during late night or early morning hours.  My brain just wasn't able to devote energy to thinking creatively or intensively. \n\nBurning myself out on everything by trying to do everything too well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor you, I'd separate the coursework from the PhD program overall.  Coursework is a nightmare right now because of COVID.  It sucks. That isn't a reflection on you, your skills, or your fitness for a PhD. Then, if you still have reservations about the PhD aspect of the program, check with your advisor about what is possible.  There's nothing wrong with narrowing the scope of your research, or switching topics, or otherwise changing things up.  Depending on your ultimate goals, you may decide how to prioritize the work you have.  If you're targeting a research-heavy university, for example, get a publication pipeline organized so you'll be ready to crank out papers. If you're going for teaching, put the papers on a bit of a backburner and focus on building up your teaching skills. Invest your energy where it'll have the best ROI. \n\nI'm sending you the warmest wishes.  I've been there. You'll come out okay on the other side of this.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jjsmpi/quitting/gaevh2e/"}, "2483": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Jack-ums", "Date": 1603913925, "Score": 7, "Body": "Yeah, can confirm.

I mean there are literally millions of people with PhDs in the world and hundreds of thousands graduate each year.  It is just the entry level training for a career in academia or research.  If you're goal isn't academia, R&amp;D, or a few fringe other jobs, then there's very little need for a PhD.  All you're really doing is learning how to become a professional researcher and proving that you can produce quality research via publishing and defending your thesis.\n\nJust for example from a friend of mine: an actuary typically has an undergrad degree, then starts on a 4-6 year path of entry level employment, a bunch of exams, and picking a specialty area to become an expert in, which gets you a professional designation at the end of it all: FSA or FCAS.  That sounds a lot like what I did when getting a PhD.  There are many other examples I could give for this type of career progression, but my main point is that the PhD is the entry level training path for academia just like the FSA/FCAS is for actuaries and if you're not dead set on academia, then you probably should focus efforts elsewhere.\n\nForgive my ignorance about the field; I don't know a whole lot about public policy and administration (my PhD is in engineering).  What benefits does a PhD in public policy get you that a masters in public policy + more experience doesn't?  Are there loads more jobs available?  Huge pay raise once you defend your thesis?  Has your career hit a plateau that you can't keep going without the degree?  Are you looking to transition into teaching/researching?  If you can basically do the same thing you want to do with a masters and loads of experience, then a PhD seems silly if it is lowering your quality of life and if the program either isn't what you thought it would be or it has changed due to covid or other departmental stuff.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jjsmpi/quitting/gaf5e61/"}, "2488": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "belabensa", "Date": 1603919500, "Score": 2, "Body": "Do you want to live on this Caribbean island?

It's quite common. Finding funding and finding your place is always more or less a matter of cooptation as well as competition. More, there is not really straight or normal way, like there's no \"normal\" phd/thesis.\n\nIt is rather common in the university to consolidate places through a game of relationships. We all have a singular trajectory with people who believe in us at a key moment, support us or even push us. It didn't mean we don't deserve it. It means that they have interest in our research and consider us like good candidates to be part of the game. Isn't it what univ/research is about ?\u00a0\n\nMy situation is pretty close to yours. I resumed my studies after a few years teaching in high school. I have been admitted to the master's program because the professor i contacted thought my project was good, but I was late for funding. Without any exam or hearing (5mn skype talk\u2026), the master director admitted me 2 days after the start of the year\u2026 We didn't achieve to find a secure funding that year. So the head of the department, who were my master supervisor 6 years before, almost give me the position (I\u2019ve been auditionned, there were 2 other candidate, PhD !, but\u2026 they decided before that they wanted me in the lab).\nAfter 1 year as a teacher, some people made me understand that I was well placed in the competition for funds : they were more or less colleagues. \nBut it was only because I worked hard.\n\nWe are several PhD students in my laboratory (socio/eco/anthropo) with this type of trajectory (most of the time, people a little older than average).\n\nYou don't have funding. It's normal that you have not gone through the whole application procedure. Competition is not only there : being accepted by 2 professors that consider you deserve to be here is the result of a competition. There's lot of people who are not admitted, funded or not (for good or bad reasons).\n\nYou are here because you worked for that and it worked.

Specifically, I\u2019m fascinated by the prospect of [pithy yet brilliant project description that will complement their own work]. I\u2019ve done a bit of [relevant stuff], which I published/presented on in the nebulous recent past. Your work in [their paper] and [their other paper] touches upon this, especially [something that shows that you actually read and mostly understood their papers].\n\n&gt;&gt;I\u2019m interested in applying to [their institution and program] and would love to have the opportunity to chat [in a format of their choosing -- phone, zoom, email, etc. leave it open-ended] with you about the possibility of us working together. I\u2019ve attached my [super fabulous] CV below, if you\u2019re interested.\n\n&gt;&gt;Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;[your name]\n\n&gt;Don\u2019t ramble on too long, since your audience is doubtless very busy, but include enough information to pique their interest and attention.\n\n&gt;Some people think attaching a CV or resume is too forward, but I think it's a helpful way to signal your respect for their time, and if they're hooked from your initial email it gives them an easy place to follow up. Chunking your pitch into multiple places also lets you include a lot of info without sending them a wall of text.\n\n&gt;What would also be *very* helpful is having a mutual friend or collaborator to name, e.g. through someone you know in your current program. Then your initial line could name-drop them, so instead of \"I saw on your website...\" you could write \"I chatted to Dr. [firstname lastname, since you're *such* good friends as to be on so familiar a basis] recently and they *strongly* encouraged me to reach out to you about the possibility of our working together...\" or something. If the mutual friend is someone they know well they'd feel much more obligated to respond, as ignoring you will be a bit like ignoring their friend instead of the hundreds of other students who email them cold every year.\n\n&gt;Likewise, if your undergrad PI is someone they know (or know of), it can be helpful to mention them in your description of [relevant stuff].\n\n&gt;\\*where there is a list of things they want in an initial contact email, 100,000,000% abide by that list unless you're a rockstar lol", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jlolt1/hi_would_anyone_be_willing_to_share_their_cold/gaqirzh/"}, "2847": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Estesp", "Date": 1604186939, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jl9jdl/how_to_improve_chances_of_being_accepted_for_a/gaqs5w7/"}}
