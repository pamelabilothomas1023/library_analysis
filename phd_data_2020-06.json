At the moment [at the start of\nWorld War II] it looks as if it were your duty. I am well aware that there\nmay seem to be an almost comic discrepancy between the high issues we\nhave been considering and the immediate task you may be set down to,\nsuch as Anglo-Saxon sound laws or chemical formulae. But there is a\nsmiliar shock awaiting us in every vocation\u2014a young priest finds himself\ninvolved in choir treats and a young subaltern in accounting for pots of\njam. It is well that it should be so. It weeds out the vain, windy people and\nkeeps in those who are both humble and tough. On that kind of difficulty\nwe need waste no sympathy.\n\n\nBut the peculiar difficulty imposed on you by the war is another\nmatter, and of it I would again repeat what I have been saying in one form\nor another ever since I started\u2014do not let your nerves and emotions lead\nyou into thinking your predicament more abnormal than it really is.\nPerhaps it may be useful to mention the three mental exercises which may\nserve as defences against the three enemies which war raises up against\nthe scholar.\n\n\nThe first enemy is excitement\u2014the tendency to think and feel about\nthe war when we had intended to think about our work. The best defence\nis a recognition that in this, as in everything else, the war has not really\nraised up a new enemy but only aggravated an old one. There are always\nplenty of rivals to our work. We are always falling in love or quarelling,\nlooking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering,\nfollowing public affairs. If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for\nsome distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our\nwork. The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge\nso badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable.\n\n\n\nFavourable conditions never come. There are, of course, moments\nwhen the pressure of the excitement is so great that only superhuman selfcontrol could resist it. They come both in war and peace. We must do the\nbest we can.\n\n\nThe second enemy is frustration\u2014the feeling that we shall not have\ntime to finish. If I say to you that no one has time to finish, that the longest\nhuman life leaves a man, in any branch of learning, a beginner, I shall\nseem to you to be saying something quite academic and theoretical. You\nwould be surprised if you knew how soon one begins to feel the shortness\nof the tether, of how many things, even in middle life, we have to say \"No\ntime for that,\" \"Too late now,\" and \"Not for me.\"\n\n\nBut Nature herself forbids you to share that experience. A more\nChristian attitude, which can be attained at any age, is that of leaving\nfuturity in God's hands. We may as well, for God will certainly retain it\nwhether we leave it to Him or not. Never, in peace or war, commit your\nvirture or your happiness to the future. Happy work is best done by the\nman who takes his long-term plans somewhat lightly and works from\nmoment to moment \"as to the Lord.\" It is only our daily bread that we are\nencouraged to ask for. The present is the only time in which any duty can\nbe done or any grace received.\n\n\nThe third enemy is fear. War threatens us with death and pain. No\nman\u2014and specially no Christian who remembers Gethsemane\u2014need try\nto attain a stoic indifference about these things, but we can guard against\nthe illusions of the imagination. We think of the the streets of Warsaw and\ncontrast the deaths there suffered with an abstraction called Life. But\nthere is no question of death or life for any of us, only a question of this\ndeath or of that\u2014of a machine gun bullet now or a cancer forty years\nlater.\n\n\nWhat does war do to death? It certainly does not make it more\nfrequent; 100 percent of us die, and the percentage cannot be increased. It\nputs several deaths earlier, but I hardly suppose that that is what we fear.\nCertainly when the moment comes, it will make little difference how many\nyears we have behind us.\nDoes it increase our changes of a painful death? I doubt it. As far as I\ncan find out, what we call natural death is usually preceded by suffering,\nand a battlefield is one of the very few places where one has a reasonable\nprospect of dying with no pain at all. Does it decrease our changes of\ndying at peace with God? I cannot believe it. If active service does not\npersuade a man to prepare for death, what conceivable concatenation of\ncircumstances would? Yet war does do something to death. It forces us to\nremember it.\n\n\nThe only reason why the cancer at sixty or the paralysis at seventyfive do not bother us is that we forget them. War makes death real to us,\nand that would have been regarded as one of its blessing by most of the\ngreat Christians of the past. They thought it good for us to be always\naware of our mortality. I am inclinded to think they were right. All the\nanimal life in us, all schemes of happiness that centred in this world, were\nalways doomed to a final frustration. In ordinary times only a wise man\ncan realise it. Now the stupidest of us knows. We see unmistakably the\nsort of universe in which we have all along been living, and must come to\nterms with it.\n\n\nIf we had foolish un-Christian hopes about human culture, they are\nnow shattered. If we thought we were building up a heaven on earth, if we\nlooked for something that would turn the present world from a place of\npilgrimmage into a permanent city satisfying the soul of man, we are\ndisillusioned, and not a moment too soon. But if we thought that for some\nsouls, and at some times, the life of learning, humbly offered to God, was,\nin its own small way, one of the appointed approaches to the Divine\nreality and the Divine beauty which we hope to enjoy hereafter, we can\nthink so still.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/guh3dj/sorry_if_inappropriate/fsjvhjc/"}, "84": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "gebruikernaam", "Date": 1591038208, "Score": 1, "Body": "Check the edit at the bottom of the post.

COVID makes it really hard to keep focus and people are in general not really in a good mood (including myself). I appreciate that you took the time to write this, because it's not easy to share and I'm also in a PhD program and my anxiety is similar.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n1. If your supervisor says that your progress is ok, accept it as true, and hold them to it (if things go wrong, they need to tell you)\n2. If you can do more, beating yourself up about it will not help. It's hard enough getting anything done at the moment (COVID, etc), let alone in a new environment with your parents.\n3. I'm reading \"the confidence gap\" by Russ Harris (I'm not big into self-help books); I think there are practical tips that can help (i.e. the confidence cycle from Russ Harris). It's important to know that you will not feel confident and despite that, you need to perform. Once you get some success, celebrate it and give yourself credit and a reward.\n4. Don't make it easier to fail. I bully myself into using the pomodoro method (until I get into a Zen-like state where I forget to reset the clock). We can't afford to listen to these negative thoughts, so meditate, have activities that can help you acknowledge these thoughts and set them aside.\n5. Declutter your workspace. I find that when my work looks messy, it can stress me out. Clean whenever you feel like procrastinating (unproductively) and your procrastination is more productive that way.\n6. Focus on the task at hand and not the time, or what other people think.\n7. Your work will probably fall short of your expectations, I know I feel like this almost all the time. We need to accept it.\n8. This will be uncomfortable, I've felt like giving up. I'm in year 2 as well, and I struggle with my supervisor. Do what you can, change what you think will help, and reflect on things after you're done.\n9. Establish boundaries: with your parents, with anyone who is cutting into your time regularly without a good reason. If they are supportive they should respect your boundaries and use your time and energy to practice the skills you need to feel sharper and dive into the discomfort.\n10. Recharge time is important, make sure you have some kind of routine that works for you.\n\nI hope this is the kind of advice that you were looking for. When we go deep into difficult topics, it takes a long time before we even get a semblance of confidence. You're not alone and if you're struggling, do reach out.

So, what I'm describing is my experience. \n\nMy PhD experience is very, very different from what I did during my bachelor's and my master's. I will list a few things:\n\n1 - A PhD is more like a job. So, I don't have to pay for it. It's the opposite, I'm paid by the university, I'm more like an employee of the university, working as a teaching assistant/research assistant.\n\n2 - Coursework is much, much harder. And, oftentimes, professors will not teach you much, they will instead point you in the right direction (hopefully) so you can pursue the knowledge by yourself.\n\n3 - The relationship you have with your advisor is extremely important. And it's more like a relationship between the boss and the subordinate, instead of professor and student. \n\n4 - Each student will have a different journey. We may be in the same class, but our research interests and projects are very different. So, we develop different types of knowledge and skills.\n\n5 - You have to deal with multiple responsibilities, that can change a lot over time, sometimes suddenly. Teaching activities, research activities, administrative activities, etc. \n\n6 - You have a ton of freedom. There are a few landmarks, like the qualifying and comprehensive exams. But especially after you are done with your coursework, almost everything is up to you. What you're going to do, how you're going to do, when you're going to do, in what order you're going to do. You gotta be able to show results, of course. But how you do that, it's pretty much up to you. \n\n7 - There are tons of uncertainty. In simple terms, during the bachelor's you learn the existing knowledge, and during the master's you apply the existing knowledge. But during the PhD you try to develop new knowledge. You will try to find answers, but you don't even know if there is an answer for that. And oftentimes nobody can really tell you what is the best way to do: it's new knowledge, so nobody knows it. \n\n8 - You need to really narrow down your interests during the PhD. You will study and become a world expert about a very small part of the knowledge. As a marketing PhD student, I will not learn much about marketing in general, but really a ton about a very specific part of marketing. \n\n9 - Finding out \"exactly what\u2019s involved in a dissertation\" is part of the journey. What's involved in my dissertation is certainly going to be very different from yours. But, broadly speaking, (1) reading a ton of papers, especially those related to your research interests, (2) learning about the methods used for research in your field and your research interests, and then trying to apply them and get some result, (3) writing your papers, presenting them, publishing them, etc.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gvhg4v/i_honestly_have_no_idea_what_to_expect/fsordkb/"}, "162": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "cocochitty", "Date": 1591139139, "Score": 3, "Body": "Gregmat videos on youtube helped me a lot.

It's fantastic that you're thinking ahead, but remember that you don't have to stick to a definite plan. I chose to pursue a PhD a semester before I graduated college and it was not what I expected. College was challenging in its own ways, but a PhD program felt like a whole other beast for me. I had to self motivate which was really hard for me (even though it was a skill that came readily to me in HS) . I had to learn to be okay with not knowing the answers to what I'm looking for in my research, which was a skill that I was previously never exposed to. \n\nTo be honest, I chose a PhD program because I wasn't sure where I wanted to go next. I knew that I was good at school and it felt familiar to me. However the qualifier/performance evaluation and the thesis overview/proposal were brutal in their own ways and amplified the anxiety that I've been dealing with since I was a kid. That being said, you don't have to go into academia post PhD, but if you do want to end up in academia, a PhD is usually required depending on what you're trying to do. \n\nAcademia typically, (but not always) mandates long hours (subject to change depending on deadlines), a challenging work/life balance, grant proposals, some amount of teaching, and some amount of advising among other responsibilities. If you're passionate about your research and establishing yourself in the field and the thought of working with/mentoring undergrads and grad students excites you, then academia would be a great option to consider!\n\nA wise PhD once told me not to fixate on the amount of time it takes to get one. It varies so much between disciplines and it doesn't help to compare how long it takes people to get one. It can be long, but it depends on your research. Definitely reach out to people with PhDs in the fields you're thinking about and try new classes/experiences during college. You might surprise yourself and end up with something you're really passionate about!\n\nTL;DR: **A PhD is worth it if you're doing it for the right reasons. You don't need to figure it out by a certain point. Plenty of people work in industry and come back to school to get one.

Two major parts of going to academia is teaching and research. So a good goal to set for your undergrad would be to do research and teach. Once you get to know some of the professors in your major, and after you've taken their classes, you can look into becoming a Teacher's Assistant (TA). Some colleges reserve this for PhD and Masters students, but mine didn't. While being a TA will not tell you how to run a class, it will get you used to public speaking and if your professor is comfortable, they may let you stand in for them for short lectures. Keep in mind, these spots are usually reserved for people who are at the end of their program, so it may take you a few years to get to this point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResearch you can get into almost immediately, but you may want to wait until you get through some of the beginning classes of your major so that you have a foundational understanding of your subject. Professors are always doing research and always looking for students to participate. Talk to them. Find professors with similar interests. Work on some projects with them. Yet again, this is just a glimpse into research. If you major offers a thesis, that can give you even more insight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, keep an open mind.

Situations change, interests change and so will your wishes and priorities. During my studies, I never felt like academia was my cup of tea. All I saw was it was lot's of work and lot's of stress. I was well into my master's program when I found just how much fun science could be. I began to see the positive sides of it, the sides that now fuel me. It was only around the end of my master's thesis that I knew I wanted to stay longer and do a PhD. I'm in my fourth year now and it was only six months ago when I decided that I wanted to continue doing science and do a postdoc. It was a slow development, a process of growth, not some path I decided on as a 20 year old.\n\n\nI think the decision will come naturally to you as well. Keep thinking about what you want to do with your life, what you enjoy doing, and you'll see where you want to go. Remember, you are in charge, you don't *have to* do anything.

Lot's of people don't, and I suspect it's this idea of \"martyrdom\" where as a PhD it's somehow \"cool\" to sacrifice all of your energy, your free time and your social life to the greater good. It's a really unhealthy attitude that will only lead you to a burn out. A PhD is not some holy grail, it's a job. It may be a highly demanding job, but still only a job. It's not worth making yourself miserable over it and sacrificing everything to it. If you realize and understand this, you'll be alright.\n\n\nThe time honestly doesn't feel like it's very long.

When my ex was working on his he was also working full time and the two huge time commitments definitely got in the way of our relationship (to the point that I broke it off). However, I\u2019m now married and I haven\u2019t found it to be difficult on my relationship to be working on my PhD. My husband does support us financially though, so I don\u2019t need to work, which makes for a huge difference in time availability. I also got pregnant right around the time I was finishing the course requirements and taking the qualifying exam. This was great in the sense that the PhD gave me more flexibility than a full time job would have to have the baby and be home afterwards, but it has also affected my time availability for studies a lot, as I\u2019m the primary care giver. However, I can\u2019t imagine being satisfied in my career without the PhD, so it\u2019s worth chugging along on it, even if the slower pace is frustrating.  My opinion may be swayed by the fact that I have had a great experience working on my PhD though. My program also has a lot of part time students so maybe it\u2019s a bit more accommodating for us with more demanding life situations. On the other hand, I often hear of these horror stories of it being a roller coaster ride. So, I would talk to students enrolled in that exact program at the school you are thinking of. They will give you a more accurate picture of the culture of the PhD in that program to see if it seems feasible to meet those expectations while maintaining a family.

I know that even that same mom advisor of mine is much harder on single students, and advisors that don\u2019t care what your family situation is are probably more frequent than not.

May I ask what the topic of your paper is? Are you writing a scientific paper (a report of an experimental study), commentary, literature review, critique, or something else? May I also ask what you mean by the \u201cstory\u201d?  \n\nFor now, here are some things I recommend:\n\nIdentify who you think the primary audience is and write your paper with those readers in mind. \n\nFind published papers that you liked reading on a similar topic written for the same audience (i.e., models). Examine how the authors organized their paper and emulate their approach. \n\nIf you\u2019re intending to submit the paper for publication, closely read journal publishing requirements (sometimes called author submission guidelines) and adjust your plan accordingly. \n\nLong sentences are not your friend. If a sentence is three lines long (i.e., spans three entire rows of a page at 12 pt Times New Roman font), then you probably should revise the sentence. Also, multiple commas in a sentence usually are good indicators that your sentence is too long. \n\nWhen revising and finalizing your paper, put yourself in the mindset of your intended audience. Imagine the reader being educated but uninformed about your topic. Abstain from implicit assumptions about your reader\u2014 you may have written in ways that assume the reader will know your intended meaning. Sentences should be free of ambiguity and other potential sources of confusion. Use precise nouns (rather than \u201cit\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d). Avoid starting sentences with prepositions and prepositional phrases\u2014 such sentences often disguise your intended meaning and may lead to extensive reliance on passive voice (which can also undermine reader understanding). \n\nPay attention to how you read what you\u2019ve written. If you find that you must use various inflections or pauses to convey meaning that aren\u2019t signaled by punctuation, then the sentence probably needs revision. In other words, if a sentence must be read a specific way in order to convey your intended meaning, then you should probably revise it. I practice this by reading aloud my written work (because silent reading is too fast to sufficiently attend to how I\u2019m reading it). Reading aloud also is a very good way to find typos and make other necessary edits. Read your paper out loud. \n\nLearn about your writing habits. Some people say it\u2019s best to write a little bit every day. I felt guilty for a long time because I can\u2019t do that. I need multiple consecutive hours to write well. I would sometimes go weeks without writing anything and feel guilty or stressed out about it. If you are productive by writing a little every day, then go for it. If not, find what works for you and stuck to that routine. \n\nFinally, and most importantly, be receptive to feedback. It can be difficult to receive feedback on something that consumed many hours of your attention. Find some people you trust will provide honest, constructive feedback and solicit their input at multiple stages of your writing. Avoid the temptation to argue or explain why their feedback is wrong or irrelevant and instead view the misunderstanding as an indicator that what your wrote wasn\u2019t clear. Remember, it is the writer\u2019s problem when the reader doesn\u2019t understand. Look at feedback as type of coaching\u2014 a way to get better at the craft. Over time, you\u2019ll become more efficient and feedback will be more easily received, especially when viewed as a means of self-improvement. \n\nHopefully this helps.

When I say \"fun\", I do not mean \"funny\", but rather mean interesting or intriguing. Think more like \"telling a story\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain I'm trying to keep this vague here. The particular piece of writing that made me start thinking about this has to do with outlining the history of my field. First off, the history of my field isn't necessarily needed to understand my results, so why include if not for the \"fun\" of it being interesting and orienting the readers' minds? Second, I can tell this history in an academic voice of description, or in a \"fun\" voice, like the one I would use if telling my friends about my research.\n\nLet's say my field is management consulting. Here's how I might write academically vs \"telling a story\":\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Prior to 21XX, only red shirts were assigned to bridge posts on Starfleet vessels. In 21XX, Dr McCoy published a paper describing evidence that Starfleet should start using using yellow shirts on the bridge instead of red shirts. This opinion has spread in the field, and now the majority of Starfleet vessels have a mixture of yellow shirts and red shirts in command. Starship management consulting has grown from Dr McCoy's  21XX paper.\"  \n\n\nas opposed to\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Long ago, human beings started to develop the means to travel beyond Earth. Having always looked up at the stars, humans could now walk among them. \n\nThis endeavour took huge effort from many disciplines. These disciplines were codified into shirt colours: red for security, yellow for engineering, and blue for science and medical. And thus the structure of a Starfleet vessel's crew was born, with red shirts in charge of command posts, including the bridge.  \n\n\nYears later, Dr McCoy of Starship Enterprise noticed that on occasions that necessitated yellow shirts -- previously isolated to engineering -- to be assigned to the bridge, the command chain suddenly became much more efficient. Where an average of two communication to clarify a message were once needed, a single message now did the trick. He tested this on a number of other vessels and discovered the effect was maintained throughout. This experiment is considered the first example of starship management consulting. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't describe this as quirky or humorous, but this is what I meant by \"fun\".

You have to remember though that essentially as a PhD you are cheap labour for a demanding job that at its heart furthers someone else's career. \n\nThe next steps up are very difficult. For a lot of post doc positions you would be expected to move university and it will go against you moving up the ladder if you haven't experienced cultures in different universties.

The worry is you reach a position after all that work where you can't compromise your family life any further and something has to give. That is not a fun situation for anyone involved.\n\n I don't think it is wrong to have the ultimate goal of being an academic but be aware what is ahead of you and that the competition is very real.

The level of the competition for these places is very high and your peers are often the best in the world at what they do. Its tough!\n\nI would say go for it, and have your initial goal of obtaining the PhD but try to insure you have some kind of safety net to go to if academia doesn't work out for you.

Or do you actually want to make machine learning algorithms?\n\nIf it's the former, then you'll probably be able to pull it off, but this type of research likely won't be in a CS department. Tons of fields are relying on programming, algorithms, and computation that aren't CS. \n\nIf you're actually looking to make machine learning algorithms, then transitioning from a finance role is less likely. These programs are pretty much mostly math. It's not about writing scripts or clever data processing the way a lot of research is in industry. It's about pushing the current boundaries of math knowledge and the fundamental and logistical limits of computing. I don't want to tell you that it can't be done, but be sure to meter your expectations if you go this route. I of course don't know how math-y your background is, what your CS connections are at top universities etc, but I would caution you that ML/AI PhDs are some of the most competitive and \"hot\" PhDs, and PhDs are VERY competetive as it stands (think less than 10% acceptance at a large state university) so a fraction of this for ML, and a lot of those applicants have the math/cs background from very good schools. \n\nSo if you really really want to go this route, make sure you're not just applying to Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, and CMU.

Thank you for being honest.\n\nbut what if I take the necessary pre-reqs? Like I said, I have already completed a CS minor and have take statistics classes and calc I &amp; II in undergrad. I just find it hard to believe that if I took more advanced math classes and more CS classes before applying that I would have less of chance because I did not have a CS major. I know a minor is only the core classes, but I really don't think the electives would've made that much of a difference in my career. At least at my university, a CS major barely got into heavy math, we didn't need linear algebra, and we only offered one ML course. We didn't even have anything past an intro to robotics class.\n\nif this is the case, then the whole education system is skewed. I know a CS major would've helped, but I know a lot of people who got bad grades or barely paid attention, so I guess to me it doesn't make sense why they wouldn't at least consider someone who took and excelled in the necessary classes. I considered a post-bacc CS degree but why even bother when there's so many fluff classes. I was considering Drexel and UC Berkley, so if going back for a second degree is worth it I guess I'll consider", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gwoh94/is_it_possible_to_get_accepted_for_a_doctoral/fszskel/"}, "621": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MysterAitch", "Date": 1591378972, "Score": 7, "Body": "The advantage of having multiple papers (or even just one) is that, when it comes to the final defense, the content you produced has already passed peer-review -- thus, what you have produced is \"good enough\" to meet the bar set for research in your field.\n\n(i.e. it demonstrates that other people in your field have already indicated that you have met the learning objective of a PhD).\n\nOf course, how helpful it is depends on your level of contribution to the paper!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gx8r87/thesis_or_multiple_articles/fszsvsn/"}, "622": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "1109278008", "Date": 1591379238, "Score": 0, "Body": "Not in CS but I ended up in Canada for grad school and am having a lovely experience here specifically because I selected my advisor from the get-go (lab rotations are basically ubiquitous in America in my field so that kind of turned me off).

I'm sure there are many self funded PhD who've finished, published and had great careers, but it's not something I personally would do. I'd hit jobs.ac.uk.and see if there are any projects with funding attached that interest you (be open, I now work in a totally field and am glad of it). Otherwise looking into potential funders and discuss the possibility of an application with an interested supervisor.

It really depends on your field and the university and I don't want to rain on your parade, but I would not suggest being self funded. I guess ask yourself the following: is it really urgent for me to do it now? Does it have to be this faculty? Can I secure funding elsewhere?\n\nThese things are hard to predict from the outside and you might see that their website only mentions 3-4 funded places - but you could also not be aware of other people on studentships and country based scholarships. Being the only self-funded one really destroyed a friend's confidence when we first started. \n\nSecondly, universities are quite cash poor at the moment. I was also teaching a bit during the phd and have been in some meetings and informal gatherings where the faculty openly said self funded phds bring a lot of money and they should increase their numbers. Just be aware that some people might think you were subject to lower standards. \n\nFurthermore, the rules in uk higher education is pretty much harmonised now in terms of time limits. In my faculty, you submit 8k words and pass a mini viva to finish 1st year, submit 30k words in 2 years, submit full first draft at the end of 3rd year and need to submit final draft in 4 years, otherwise you are kicked out.\n\nAdditionally, some universities limit the number of hours you can work in your own faculty. I am not talking about visa stuff, I mean they limit how much you can work so that you can focus on your PhD, as a \"favour\" to you. So basically UK system is all about churning out PhDs as fast as possible with minimal teaching experience (which only pays about \u00a320 per hour anyway). Sure, you can chase jobs outside but that's also not guaranteed. \n\nYou have to keep in mind that higher education is a business, they will not automatically have your best interest at heart. It will not be like being a masters student. It will be quite solitary.

It was obvious in undergrad with the party kids, the undecided, the kids who were forced there by their parents or the people who just did what was next and didn\u2019t really care. I\u2019d say 40% of the people should just have done something they actually cared about and not university. \n\nI\u2019ve done two masters degrees and both of them were similar, probably 60% of people on those programs just should\u2019ve done something else. They didn\u2019t really care, they didn\u2019t have projects they were passionate about, they did it because it\u2019s what you do after finishing undergrad. Most of the people on both of my courses went on to do something that had nothing to do with the degree, and most of the time didn\u2019t even require a masters to do, let alone an unrelated masters. \n\nNow, in my PhD, it\u2019s so painfully obvious that people are unprepared, lacking passion, and just doing it to do it. Probably 80% of my cohort are just there because they don\u2019t know what else to do, saw an opportunity and figured why not. \n\nIt\u2019s most obvious in the \u2018intro\u2019 course we had to take. We had this obnoxious intro course on the most basic stuff like: how not to plagiarize, how to cite sources, basic stats, how to structure an argument, how to use library resources and sources like JSTOR, how to do basic research, etc. \n\nI\u2019d think you should know how to cite a source by the time you start your PhD. The university\u2019s argument is that they wanted to make sure everyone was on the same level, I always assumed that\u2019s what the application process was for...\n\nThe worst part were the people who had funding to work on pre-structured projects. At the start they\u2019d present their projects in two parts, the part they had to do for the money, and their novel idea/contribution to the project.

About six months ago I started seriously considering a PhD to further my learning and increase my skillset especially with research. And I had all the same reservations that you do, and wondered why I would \"rock the boat\" when I've arrived in a good place in life personally and professionally, with just the usual ups and downs. I do have kids which was probably the biggest reason I was reserved and hesitant about pursuing a doctorate, since I want to be present with them and not gone constantly. That, and I kept thinking about why I would do a PhD since I don't foresee changing jobs at the end of it (compared to a MA which was a major career boost to do the job I wanted to do). \n\nBut my employer is willing to provide the flexibility, a lot of the funding, and sees where gaining the skills you learn in a PhD is advantageous to the job that I have. I have a supportive husband and my kids are at a good age for me to take this on. One of my colleagues did the same program I've been accepted into, and she's found that just having the credentials provides a lot of open doors that she didn't have at a master's level, even in terms of pay raise, speaking opportunities, research, and increased referrals in her private practice.\n\nSo...I couldn't find a lot of reasons to NOT do it. The more I thought about it, the more excited I got about going back to school as I love reading and genuinely enjoy learning. And if I get into it and don't like it, I'm telling myself there is no shame in quitting.  \n\nI appreciated the comments already in this thread about being in a more \"settled\" place in life being an advantage, and that makes sense to me (comparing myself to early 20's in my grad program). Plus for me, I feel like this opportunity frees me up to focus on learning and developing skills as my main goals, whereas sometimes before as a student I was more focused on the grades and where the degree was going to lead me career-wise, if that makes sense. \n\nGlad to find someone else in a similar boat!

Don't think too much about perfecting every single sentence. When you read a paragraph later, it will often be better than you initially thought when writing it. Then perfect the sentences and the structure. You can think about structure before you start to write, so you know which paragraphs you need to write at what leads to what and perfect the structure when reading/rewriting. But when you write, write. If you get stuck in a sentence, then write an ugly one. Use synonyms or just explain what it is that you want to write for yourself. Just keep writing.\n\n2) Let someone else read the text as early as possible. Don't think that everything should be perfect when you send it to the first reader.

In theological studies, some programs are very rigorous being philosophically and historically top tier, while others are much more politically driven and only loosely connected to a major discipline of thought (ie very loose connection to politics, philosophy, literature, etc.), the result in some of these fields is you get a mixing of ideas, none of which are at a high level.   \n\n\nIf this might be part of the issue with gender studies, here's just a suggestion: you might also consider other cognate disciplines which have very deep research communities (ie. renown journals, large academic societies, cutting edge research and prestigious centres and researchers): ie. political science, psychology, philosophy. Any of these would allow you to take the question of gender quite seriously and directly.   \n\n\nThere's also the matter of rigour in one institution over another.

I in no way claim to be an expert of such a wonderful country when I did the typical white girl thing of not properly learning the language and I enjoyed all the privileges afforded to white westerners there. But that's all for another day.\n\nWhen there I became friends with an American professor who was at marrakech uni for a 1 year placement. Unfortunately, it is true that a lot of the academic standards just aren't up to international standard. He said his masters students saw no issue with plagiarising work. He really felt the standard overall just wasn't the same as the US. So I agree, your experience in the Moroccan uni system may be lacking.\n\nHowever, there are huge somewhat racist barriers in academia. Research done in and led by \"southern\" countries if often unfairly thought of as not as good. And its the western academics in western unis who think their perspectives on foreign countries are more valuable than the people who are from and in those countries themselves. I totally agree Morocco has huge need for gender studies, and the lack of support for your programme probably demonstrates this well. But arguably, by sticking where you are you are doing huge things for gender equality as well as raising the standards of research in your department.\n\nSo I think this is a common problem in different ways the world over - the \"brain drain\". So many promising young people who want to make the world better leave their environments and be amongst people who are like minded who they can work alongside to make the world better. All the while leaving things back home not so great. I'm actually from Northern Ireland, and the brain drain has been going on for generations in Ireland.\n\nI would say if you're prepared for the fight and you enjoy living in Morocco then you could do great things there! Work hard at making international academic relationships and learn from those who are at the standard you want to be. Take online training courses, find a mentor, find a buddy. Just all random ideas for you.\n\nIf you decide to stick it out then I suggest exploring the UK model of a phd more closely as opposed to the US. In the UK we have a more solitary phd experience, especially in social sciences. We don't work as part of large labs. People often don't even have a research group or seminars to share ideas. And in the worst case, bad supervisors mean they have very little guidance. These are not necessarily good things, but reassurance that you can have a great quality phd even if not in the best environment.\n\nYou could also explore great online communities such as notsoivorytower on instagram. They champion propping up non western and non white academia so you could meet some great people.\n\nSorry if what you really wanted was advice on how to get out of your programme and find a better new path.

There are definitely going to be people that you can imagine yourselves as in their level and that's how your PhD will be worth it.\n\nUnfortunately you will be battling for good education, battling for gender equality, whilst also battling to better the academic system there. It definitely isn't the easy route, but if you carve your own path it will be worth it.\n\nI have a food friend who returned to Iraq after her PhD and when there she fought hard against the education ministry and her university to change their standards. She knew it had to be done to help better the education system. Of course Iraq and Morocco are not the same, but it's the only example I had to give of someone doing such a thing. Fighting for change that will make people's held to a higher standard in their jobs is going to have resistance. Even now as you begin this you will have a lot of resistance in your department just for doing things differently.\n\nFor the record, I have several good friends who are strong, determined Arab women and they are a force to be reckoned with when they set their mind to something.

At the end of the day, it's not your control if your supervisor has regret choosing you over another student.

I can mostly speak to the experience in northwestern Europe, for example I have no idea how France/Spain/Italy or any of the central/eastern European countries are organizing PhDs. \n\nFirst of all, higher education in Europe is pretty splintered. Even though in the EU you now get unified bachelor (typically 3 years) + master (1-2 years) degrees, what happens afterwards is very diverse.\n\nTypically, you will need a master's degree before starting a PhD, and selection for the program can be anything from getting accepted into a US-style graduate school (rare), to applying for a 3/4 year position in a lab (like an actual job), to having to write your own funding proposal. \n\nThe programs will typically be funded for 3 years (e.g. UK, Denmark, Germany) or 4 years (e.g. Netherlands, Norway), and usually will be scientifically focused, so courses or TA'ing are not as much a thing as in the US (from what I read here). Payment is better in the countries where it's an actual job (e.g. Scandinavia, Netherlands) and not a stipend (e.g. UK, Germany) - the latter are about on par with US I think. \n\nExploitation and low chances of success are still very much a thing, though I believe that competition in the US is still harder. As everywhere, it will depend more on the lab you are going to work in and on your supervisor - there are great ones and terrible ones. The degree of hierarchy can vary per country as well. (See [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7) for Nature's latest worldwide PhD survey for a comparison between Europe and the US).  \n\nEven then, chances for a career in academia are slim overall, see for example [this report](http://go.nature.com/roysoc) from the UK shows that 0.5% of a PhD cohort make it to a tenured position. Other European countries tend to fare slightly better, but still not great. One thing I haven't seen yet in academia in Europe are adjunct positions, so depending on your interpretation people are forced out earlier, or they are exploited less (here is a [report](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/523621v2) specfically about chances for postdocs all across Europe. TLDR: it's grim everywhere, but especially so in southern Europe). I believe there is a lot less private funding in most European countries, but haven't seen actual comparisons anywhere. \n\nWhether or a EU PhD is comparable in prestige to a US I can't say - my guess would be that it very much depends on the connections that you'd make during that time, especially if you want to stay in academia. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, I hope it helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/h0h55o/europe_vs_united_states_programs/ftmctak/"}, "1285": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Noahglaser", "Date": 1591820485, "Score": 4, "Body": "Cop out answer but I just set hard deadlines that cannot be moved under any circumstances.

Would I be involved in research in some way? Should I develop some other skill / knowledge, that is important but not covered by the coursework?\n\n\\- We talked more about the work my advisor does.

I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true for all schools, however.\n\nI also took a few years off between my masters and my PhD.

Like you, I really desired this from personal convictions. You might not have your dissertation topic in mind right now but you probably know some fields that interest you. You could start looking into programs based on field. It will help you figure out what you desire from a program. The Junto is a website focused on early America but they have some insightful posts on life in grad school. Look into other blogs\u2014but be wary of GradCafe. It can be very cut throat.

Put bluntly, it is probably not the best use of your supervisor's time (for you OR them) to have them correcting lots of line errors and fundamental writing flaws. A writing center or copy editor is probably better qualified to help or teach you these sorts of things. Courses in writing for academics are widely offered at universities and by independent services. I would suggest looking around your university for resources first because it's usually free for graduate students. Since you said you agree that your writing needs work, this might be a good idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also am in writing groups with other grad students in my department where we read and comment on each others' writing every week.

Maybe these are things that came up in your classes, or that you are interested in or worried about, or that your advisor told you to focus on. Anyway, identify a few important things and then try to find where and how they are discussed in the literature. This might be something like: \"HR issues\" or \"workplace trauma\" or \"neoliberal policy\" or whatever. Write each of the themes as a header in a single document. Then, when you find passages or who papers / books that connect to one of the themes, paste under the header the core idea or quotes from the article that show the connection to that theme, and note the author, date, and page number. Keep doing this until you have many things for each theme.\n\nWhile doing this, keep an eye out for other themes that weren't your original ones. If they are coming up a lot, go ahead and make a new header for that theme and keep noting items that fall under it too. Once you have many entries under each theme, sourced from many different readings, read through them all. Are there themes that could be split up or \"drilled down\" into a few more specific themes? Are there things that are not related enough to your topic? Are there things that you think should be there but are not?\n\nAfter you start to get some direction about the topics you will likely include, keep reading and keep adding to the items under the themes, and keep adding new themes that make sense to include.\n\nDon't add EVERYTHING, make sure to stay focused on your topic. My advisor told me that research isn't just about writing. Think about the topic as if you knew nothing about it. What contextual and background info would you want to know in order to better understand the specific research topic?

I've seen some places set up emotional support services for partners of PhD students - There's a reason for that. I had zero time to do anything fun, and when I did, it was always filled with guilt because \"I should be doing work.\" A lot of PhD programs in Social Work (less sure about Public Health) don't have many PhD's enrolled at once and they tend to range widely in age. In my experience, there's less of a chance of a \"cohort\" culture because you do your foundation courses and split off independently into different interests/projects/labs, etc. You're really left on your own.\n\nI would seriously discourage anyone from pursuing the PhD to make anyone other than themselves proud. I'm not faulting you - I realized late that I started this for similar reasons. My motivation absolutely tanked after my mother passed away.  It would be a disservice to yourself to do something this strenuous for any other reason.\n\nThere's a very good chance a PhD will take a massive emotional toll. It will be hard if you're already prone to depression and anxiety. Racism is alive and well in academia. Literally every student I know has cried at some point in front of their advisor. We've all thought about dropping out at least a few times. Imposter Syndrome is real. I've noticed it more among students who have had a rough start in life. Some of the most helpful personality traits, in my opinion, is emotional resiliency and grit. I always suggest looking into therapy or setting up some other support network prior to starting.\n\nThere is zero guarantee a PhD will make you more money. If money is the motivator, you will be sorely disappointed. What is it that you'd really like to do with it? Academia is the most common path. If this is what you'd like to do, then it makes perfect sense. Otherwise, I'd do some research to see if it's truly worth it.\n\nFinally, if your Masters degree is in Social Work, I also want to let you know that MSW programs and Social Work PhD programs are *completely* different.

I am probably going to go over what others have advised you. I completed my masters degree almost three years ago and I was adamant that I would not go back to education. I didn't find my master's degree a struggle, in fact I really did enjoy it. After I completed my friend said now do a PhD to which I did F**k off to him. \n\nI went back to work and then after a few months I realised this is not what I want to be doing. I loved research and the idea of a PhD started scratching at the back of my mind but for a good while I ignored it. The same friend visited me (hadn't seen him for 10 years because we both moved away for uni) and we started talking about doing a PhD. He made points about everyone now having a bachelor's degree and how they have been watered down in the job market and then he talked about how master's degrees are going to same way blah blah. \n\nI thought about it and then I was offered a management position at work. I was dead pleased about it but did not answer straight away. I still had the idea of the PhD but the boost in earnings was definitely swaying it for me. I had s week to make my decision and so I said I would take the role. There were things I wanted to do like buy a car and travel and this would let me go it. Anyway, on the day of the decision I was sat in the office with my manager and they asked if I had made a decision and I enthusiastically said I have. Then for some reason at the last minute I said No. My answer surprised me because I was going in with a yes mindset. I couldn't explain to them why I said no but had to make up some bullshit excuse like I wasn't ready for the role and they really admired my honesty \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. It wasn't even that I was ready, after a bit of reflection I realised it wasn't what I wanted.\n\nMoney is great and everything but it is way more important to do a job that you enjoy. It doesn't matter if you are doing a PhD or if you are employment because you WILL have to make sacrifices. Treat your PhD like a job and work 9-5 or 9-8 whatever you want during the week and have weekends where you can do what you want to... Have that social life you seem to yearn for. \n\n\nDoing a PhD does not mean life is put on hold (ok sometimes it does) but if you manage your time, do your work and are strict you will be ok. I've been where you are and have had that mental tug of war with the idea of doing a PhD or staying in employment for a while. You realise the pro's and con's of doing one but don't let the approval of your father or anyone else be a key motivator because you are going to put yourself under so much unnecessary pressure. You need to ask yourself a lot of questions and answer them honestly. In a way you are in a very privileged position in that you have a number of options available to you and the beauty of it is, is that there isn't really a wrong answer. \n\nOh and just so you know about how my struggle ended...I am still working in the same role I took after my master's degree but I will be resigning in 6 weeks. I told them after turning down the managers job that I wanted to do a PhD. They were supportive and allowed me to work part time so I could volunteer in mental health. For my PhD I emailed numerous supervisors about my research proposal in an attempt to get on one self-funded.

I finished my PhD last year and I am a postdoc now. \n\nPhD is largely about managing your expectations. I worked previously as a programmer, and there you only carry out tasks that you know you can do and that are of direct relevance. So every day you accomplish something and you feel good about it. A feeling that is closer to PhD is when you are asked to do something that was never supposed to be done and has to be thrown away. But as you keep throwing away things that becomes very demotivating. \n\nIt is rare that people truly enjoy doing PhD - a lot are miserable and then proud of \"making it through\" friends I recall. Motivated chapters throughout a PhD are a blessing. My own experience was far from the best: I was expected to do the best work by my supervisors who barely did a \"average work\" (but they publish). It was worse: a lot of cases where morality was not the most desired quality. \n\nSo I was adamant about was to be right to my own values and focus on my feeling of learning and becoming more critical. My research was rather poor, and in fact most research is far from ideal. Saying that is easy, but emotionally it was more draining throughout my PhD - I feel much better now as a postdoc due to many reasons. For example, to appear well during my upgrade I'd be asked to do lots of unrelated work just was later largely discarded.\n\nWhereas I have not done any great research, I have improved and shared many tools, shared my expertise, asked the right questions, tried to push science in the right directions, and encouraged others. These sadly do not translate to my academic success. But I would recommend the same to you: if you can, pair up with friends and motivate each other, take holidays, have a hobby, do not let unreasonable expectations bring you down, make sure you have a supportive circle.

Your GPA might be fine too. My concern is your publishing history - Unless you're a first author on that paper or you have a few more on your resume, that will make your application weaker than others'. Of course, they should ideally also be in decent journals. You'd also need a really strong GRE score, so that's something else to keep in mind. Plus, an extremely well-written essay, strong recommendations, etc. Connecting with a faculty member you hope to work with will be helpful too - Kind of like finding jobs, a connection could really make all the difference.\n\nPhD's, especially clinical and/or neuroscience fields, are extremely competitive. It's not uncommon to see people get rejected from every program after a few rounds of applications. Another thing to consider is that even getting into APA-approved internships has been extremely tough lately, as far as I've heard.\n\nPhD's stress research with the clinical training. If you don't like research and don't want to write a dissertation, you won't have a good time in PhD programs. PsyD's are clinically-oriented. They are typically very expensive and few people receive scholarships, but they're easier to get into, which you already know. PhD's should be funding you. If they aren't, it's not worth it.

Some of them are categorically different from the reasons they gave you and therefore could be simply copping out of being honest with you (funding drying up/you\u2019re more alien to the body of work than the students they normally pick and they initially thought no big deal/change of plans regarding group size and ambition etc). Some others paint your advisor as a poor manager (in terms of communication of expectations/calibration of your ability vs their requirement/ability to break down work loads and manage or micromanage/some internal conflict resolution etc). Or if nothing else, it\u2019s simply because they misjudged your talents and what you were bringing to the table, which again, does not imply that you\u2019re falling short, but simply that as an assessor and interviewer, it was their job to figure out if you would work well with their style. Grad school is tricky because it\u2019s essentially an employer-employee relationship under the guise of academic mentoring and education. But you gotta remember, unless you\u2019re Andy Bernard and took a dookie on their boss\u2019 car, it\u2019s rarely the employee\u2019s fault they get laid off. \n\nSo, what next? First and foremost, take a very short break. You\u2019re technically starting with a clean slate\u2014 which is great, but clean slate also means ditching the last so many months of your life towards grad school, which sucks. And I don\u2019t mean go on a vacation. But sit back and take stock of the situation. Think very carefully and address a number of very specific questions. Right now, you\u2019re probably clouded by emotions and so there\u2019s a general sense of the question- \u201cwhat next?\u201d. But it\u2019s not one question, but a culmination of multiple choices you\u2019ll have to make over the next few weeks/months. Do you want to stay in the same department/university? Do you want to continue pursuing a PhD (this is not only to make you question if you are capable, but you\u2019ve now have some difficult experiences of grad school under your belt. There\u2019s nothing wrong in asking yourself if you\u2019re going to find it all worth it all over again)? What could you do in future to avoid/avert/mitigate such challenges in future? And so on. I am sure all relevant subs-  r/PhD, r/Labrats and r/Gradschool will help you in itemizing your thoughts about all of these.\n\nI guess the next step after that would become immediately clear from asking yourself all of these. But also, in the meantime, if you would otherwise feel anxious not actively seeking a solution to getting fired, I can definitely recommend you start talking with other faculty\u2014  a lot more graduate students end up in the same boat as you than you would\u2019ve guessed, and approaching other faculty (both within and outside your department) to enquire about research opportunities is quite normal. You could even hedge your plans to make them short term- maybe they don\u2019t have a PhD position, but would they be interested in hiring you as a guest researcher or research assistant etc? \n\nAlso, I asked you to take stock of the situation because if  you want to drop plans for phd (completely or at least for a while), if you\u2019re studying in the US, there could be a potential opportunity for you to still salvage the last few months of your efforts and school fees by converting your PhD into a masters degree. If you want to do this, my advice would be to approach the graduate student administrator, the head of department and your advisor to discuss this matter (in that order). \n\nWhatever you do, I promise you this is not the end of the road, and one scholar\u2019s rejection is not a proof of your inability to do quality research. The world inside and outside of academia is rich with examples of people whose potential was heavily underestimated. After all, even Einstein had to do some of his most ground breaking work in the patent office because no university wanted to hire him as a faculty. \n\nGood luck! :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hb9xc6/i_got_fired_and_now_i_am_crushed/fv7ojeu/"}, "1942": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1592468048, "Score": 1, "Body": "yes he can and will ban any visa even people who ALREADY have a visa and visited home but now fly back to the USA for example.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hafx5i/advice_on_following_a_risky_travel_plan_to_return/fv7ovpk/"}, "1943": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dada903", "Date": 1592469355, "Score": 4, "Body": "I'm thinking the same, although almost no progress is seen looking from one day to the other, when I look at the last 3-4 weeks there's something there, and when I look at 2-3 months, there's a bit more.

My undergrad was huge and I went to school in a large city. Most grad cohorts I've seen are made up of as little as two students, up to maybe 15 or so, but these are rough estimates based on those around me. There is close attention and oftentimes close scrutiny of your performance as a person, student, and scholar. Most students tend to get pretty self-critical by nature. You're also pretty much left to do most things by yourself after a few years of coursework. The things you are expected to do are also completely different from college and you'll need to learn your own pace - Obviously, it's not structured courses and exams the way it is in college. Overall, there is a ton of pressure to do a lot more at once and truly be good at it - No more getting away with bullshitting or that last-minute all-nighter.

Imposter Syndrome is something most of us experience, especially if you're an ethnic/racial minority, first-gen college student, or a woman, and that can get really stressful. If you're lucky, you'll wind up with a supportive cohort and nice faculty advisors.\n\nMost doc. students I've met have wondered if we're crazy, thought several times about dropping out, cried in front of advisors, etc. Statistically, half drop out before they finish and are far more likely to show symptoms of depression. Few have been able to tell me fun stories about their PhD experience the way that I can about college, and that's because they're stressed out, have little leisure time, and are broke anyway, and that's often just accepted as part of the process.

She hosts this summer bootcamp thing for us where we worked on PhD app materials, there were meetings twice a week during fall and spring where we focused on professional development, listened to guest speakers in different STEM fields, or talked about issues within academia (e.g., being a minority in STEM). She also found a way later in her career to focus her research more on things that mattered to her personally. She began with researching squirrels and mice, and then moved on to having two labs (one with mice and the other with humans) studying neuroscience (specifically, maternal behaviors in mice and in Mexican women).  \n\nAlso, as a side note, I would recommend to be careful to not make the experience all about you (\"white guilt\") when it's issues related to racism.

It took me some time to learn how to use different techniques and, probably, it was the most interesting part of my research. Then I had to use the same techniques on different systems, and I got really bored and lost my motivation. And, from the beginning, my relationship with my advisor wasn't that good, mostly because I didn't know how to communicate well with him. He wanted us to be in the lab every day, Sat and Sun included. For my first Thanksgiving Day, I wanted to take a few days off, he asked me since when Thanksgiving Day was my holiday. Later, I found out that no one on the department got along well with him. At that time, I thought it was my fault and that I wasn't good enough to be a PhD student. And I felt guilty about the whole situation since I had a full scholarship for my PhD. I stayed in his lab for \\~2.5 years. During that time I passed all exams, including a PhD qualifying exam. Since my minor was in Computer Sci, I took several CS courses. I loved spending my time coding so much so that I started thinking about quitting my PhD and doing a MSc in CS. But, again, since I had a scholarship, I felt terrible about quitting. Finally, I decided to talk with a professor who was the department head at that time. That wasn't an easy decision, but it turned out to be the best decision that I made. I had his support and got encouraged to take into consideration the other options. Few months later, a new professor joined the department. Since his research was in computational polymer physics, the department head advised me to talk with him and see if I would be interested in his research.  I did it and he became my new advisor. I finished my PhD in the next 3 years. I did work almost every day, but not because my advisor expected that from me, than because I wanted to. I was genuinely interested in my research and my advisor was very supportive. I was miserable in the first lab, but I was happy in the second lab. Since I was initially admitted to a joint MSc/PhD program, I wrapped up my work in the first lab into my MSc thesis. My first advisor got so angry at me when I told him I was leaving his lab that he told me I would not get any publications out of my work in his lab. And I didn't get any publications out of, just my MSc thesis, but I didn't care. I left and never looked back.

It was a pretty big limitation when it comes to a job search. Besides, I wasn't too concerned and proactive about finding a real job. I was completely independent in the lab and could do whatever I was interested in, so that was great.

Next two years I didn't do research but I was teaching. Then I missed doing research and decided to do a postdoc in Switzerland. Postdoc salary in Switzerland was much better in the US, even though the cost of living in Zurich was higher than in NYC. I was able to travel more and save much more money than in NYC. Also, I had most weekends free in Switzerland, which wasn't the case in US. Regarding moving, it's tough. As a PhD student, I came to US with two big suitcases. I lived there for almost 14 yrs so I accumulated a lot of possessions. When I moved back to EU, again I packed two big suitcases, and gave everything else to my friends there. That was my lesson to buy only e-books, e-music, etc. and to stop buying things that I don't really need. Moving to Switzerland was easy since I already had a lot of experience with packing my life in two suitcases. Moving back from Switzerland to my homecountry was more expensive since I decided to move my furniture as well. But at least, both countries are in Europe :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hd4yz3/i_have_a_phd_in_chem_eng_2_postdocs_in_science/fvjezxh/"}, "2216": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CR_224", "Date": 1592749363, "Score": 2, "Body": "PowerPoint with the embedded video pre recorded.

My second postdoc ended \\~6 months before it was planned because my PI didn't get a grant renewal. So, one day he invited me to his office and told me my project had to be terminated by the end of that month. That was the first time he mentioned that the grant had to be renewed (it was already renewed twice before, so he and other two PIs thought it would be renewed for sure the third time as well). Since my visa depended on my job, I had to leave the country and move back to my home country. I took one year off, and then tried to find a new job. I didn't want to go back to academia so I was looking for a job in industry. But it was a very difficult switch to make after staying so long in academia, and after taking one year off. I don't want to generalize, but my experience is the longer you are not working, the more difficult it is to find a new job. I was looking for jobs in pharma. My experience is in molecular dynamics simulations of proteins and membranes. At that time most computational positions in pharma required experience with machine learning, data science, bioinformatics, which I didn't have. I got several interviews, one in person, the others on phone or Skype, but always someone with experience in these fields was employed. Finally, I gave up on my job search and decided to employ myself. I always admired entrepreneurs and wanted to have my own business but wasn't sure what I could do. I considered different options but at the end I've realized that two things that I love to do are: helping others and being in touch with science and scientists. That's how I established my PhD coaching/consultation business. \n\nMy advice to you would be to try to find a postdoc in industry. It's a good way to jump from academia to industry. You get experience that is relevant to industry, which is often very different from experience from academia. Most of my colleagues who got a postdoc in industry, found a job in industry. If you stay in academia with the idea to go to industry later, choose to do something that industry is looking for. Try to find a PI who has connections with industry, so that he/she can help you find a job later. For industry, it is very helpful to have such connections, someone to recommend you, or someone from the company to forward your CV.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hd4yz3/i_have_a_phd_in_chem_eng_2_postdocs_in_science/fvjujus/"}, "2228": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "QueueTee314", "Date": 1592758760, "Score": 1, "Body": "Vim or emacs, kind sir?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hd4yz3/i_have_a_phd_in_chem_eng_2_postdocs_in_science/fvjwcx7/"}, "2229": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "pennylaine713", "Date": 1592759186, "Score": 8, "Body": "First of all, I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nI started my PhD in Oct 2018 and my dad got sick (cancer) in May 2019.

I recommend setting it up on your personal computer, the electrophoresis computer (so that you can easily save gel image files to your folder), and the printer computer.\n\nThis guide will help.\n\nMake a \u201cData archive\u201d folder of some sort in your research folder that will hold copies of all of your data (sequencing, assays, gel images) in one place-- this will make it easier to find things when you\u2019re writing papers or making presentations later on (you can still keep those data files organized in their separate project folders, or however you like to organize your stuff, but I\u2019d contend that having everything in one place can prevent headaches later on from hunting for data in piles of folders).\u00a0\n\n\nUse alt+tab to switch between programs (on a Windows computer) if you don\u2019t already- it can streamline work, especially on a laptop.

This doesn\u2019t work everywhere; you can also try SciHub or LibGen, but be aware these sites are not 100% above board; be careful not to download any viruses by mistake.)\n\nWeb of Science is packed with useful search tools and citation management tools. You can sort by most cited to see the highest impact papers on a topic for a given time range, by \u201cUsage count\u201d to see which articles have been used most (potentially a better read on the paper\u2019s importance than citation count), \u201cUsage count\u201d last 180 days to see recent high impact works, etc. You can click on the \u201cTimes Cited\u201d number to see what papers cited the one you\u2019ve found, sort those by highest citations, and find a bunch more relevant papers. Moreover, Web of Science interfaces directly with EndNote, making keeping your literature and citations organized a breeze! Set up an account on Web of Science using your gatech.edu email. Log in at least once from campus to get your account verified.\n\nDownload EndNote and install it. Endnote interfaces directly with Word, allowing you to insert citations with ease (it also automatically generates and formats your references section).\u00a0\n\n\nSet up EndNote online\u2014again, this backs up all your literature/citations to the cloud, where you don\u2019t have to worry about losing it.\n\nOrganize your EndNote library by article subject, by project, or however else you think would be useful:\u00a0\n\n\nTo import a reference to EndNote most easily, on Web of Science, click the box to the left of your paper of interest.\nThen click \u201cExport\u201d at the top of the page, and choose \u201cExport to EndNote online\u201d.\nNavigate to your Endnote application:\u00a0\nClick the sync button.\nNavigate to the \u201crecently added\u201d tab, and there\u2019s your reference.\nHighlight any papers you want to find the PDF for, right click, hover over \u201cfind full text\u201d, then click \u201cfind full text\u201d.

It is really easy to feel like you are the only one struggling. Once you talk regularly with your classmates, you'll realize that most of them feel the same way, and just knowing that does wonders for your mental health.\n\nSecond, these can be some of the best friends you ever make. There's something about going through the same hard program that can forge great friendships.\n\nThird, this will hopefully make you more comfortable meeting people, and later on networking is going to be annoyingly important.\n\nFourth, while usually most everyone is struggling, often times not everyone is struggling with the same exact bit of material. I often found that I was good at understanding one thing but a classmate was struggling with, whereas they had a good handle on stuff I struggled with. Helping each other out not only helped me understand things I was having problems with but helped understand much better things that I thought I understood. Teaching others is often the best study method.\n\n\nAnother piece of advice that might be more discipline dependent: stop caring about your grades. Stop right now.\n\nMy professors in core subjects (that is subjects where there was a qualifier) would be absolutely brutal when grading. They needed to be, and I'm glad now they were, because meeting those high standards also made me a much better student, but if I had been an undergrad my homework scores would not have secured me a passing grade. This was very worrisome until I got straight A's. You see they were trying to prepare me for a qualifier and they graded accordingly, but they knew our TAships were tied to our GPAs and they weren't trying to screw us over if we were making an effort.

Often, it happens because we are overtired and need some time off to recharge. If so, take a day or few days off and enjoy it to the fullest.

It works great for me because when I finish a small task, I get that sense of accomplishment that motivates me to do more. \n\nMake a plan for every day, have 1-3 bigger goals, and work on them.

I can honestly say that working in R&amp;D was hard but I was extremely driven by my passion for the topic that it was easy to find motivation while at work to keep chugging.

But, if you are presenting and talking to them, you are already showing whether you have good communication skills or not. \n\nIn my case, coding was a weakness, but I showed that I was already working on that, and for me, the PhD was a way to get stronger in that regard.\n\nI think most professors don't care if you are a workaholic or not, for example.

I come from an Economics background and it has been quite an adjustment to think (and especially write) like a historian. \n\nIf I had to advise someone in your position, I'd say try to get the most leisure/enjoyment out of the time that you have. There are many reasons for this: \n\n1. An average researcher takes 1-2 years to get to the knowledge frontier of their field. If you read constantly from now until October, you'll save about 4 months theoretically. Practically speaking, you will save much less, because (a) your topic and what niche you want to focus on will change as you go on, and this is best done under supervision so you don't go down rabit holes that aren't as rewarding bother from a value added to your field perspective, and a publication perspective. (b) It's just a  lot easier to absorb different varieties of literature (or at least get recommendations) based on your supervision. So practically speaking, you really won't save much time. If you read too much of a certain type of literature, your perspective may already be biased before you even start. As Bruce Lee said, \"be like water\". I sometimes spend my time on an excel sheet with a conspiracy theorist trying to prove to him that pyramids can be reconstructed in the modern day. It's really rewarding because I can really understand argumentation and sources, and where people's biases come in, and then see them in myself.\n\n2. On the other hand, remember, this is not a sprint, but rather a marathon. No matter how smart you are, or how much you read, once you start, a few months in, when you look ahead, the road will seem very very long. So even if you are starting to get \"bored\" of leisure, it is nice to approach that wall as a horse, straining at the reigns to get started, rather than one that already used up some of its steam and then feels overwhelmed. \n\n3. What I do recommend is to take light online classes just to (a) keep your academic brain alive and (b) develop more of an interest in your topic. \n\n4. The ONLY motivation I have seen work for phDs is curiosity and a genuine interest in your topic. In 2 years when you are at the knowledge frontier you will be an expert in your niche field. Until you get there, you may feel like you know nothing constantly. This is a problem if your motivation was to \"be a doctor\", \"be an expert\", \"learn something noone knows\", \"find something noone knows\", \"test yourself and do something super hard\" etc. However, if you really just want to figure out your project's biggest questions, knowledge is always infinite and the more you absorb (which was the whole point of doing the phD), the more gaps you'll see where you can make a contribution to your field. Once you are \"activated\" as a researcher and get into this state of receptivity, every meal you eat, shower you take, and videogame you play can spark a creative flame in you.

Even if you're in a highly experimental field, your major classes form the base of your theoretical knowledge which your research builds upon. It's an especially important metric for theorists. Generally the people looking for \"extension\" work in the form of research are already doing pretty well in their classes, otherwise they'd be dedicating their spare time to their classes, not to research.\n\nThere are a few exceptions where grades don't represent knowledge or ability in those subjects, but that's usually because of illness, disability, extenuating circumstances etc. But even in the case of having to work or having serious health issues that prevented you from learning, if your grades are low because they *do* represent your understanding, and you didn't do anything after that to rectify the holes in your knowledge, it's completely understandable that a PhD program wouldn't want to take the risk. An F grade in physics is pretty solid evidence that you don't know the physics from that course. That's why it's so important to retake classes or to do very well in later classes to prove that the F isn't accurate anymore.\n\nBut it's also a function of competition. If it's down to a small group of people who all have equivalent research experience, LORs, etc, but some people have a low GPA... well, you know for certain that the high GPA people could achieve a high GPA, but it's only guesswork if the low GPA people could have done the same with more support. That's why LORs and personal statements are so important, and it's why you won't actually have a case of two equal candidates except for GPA.

If you are doing a PhD with a new academic (early career academic making steps towards professorship) then you may be expected to do a bit more of everything, having to become more of a jack of all trades and there is likely to be programming or modelling involved in the data analysis somewhere along the line.

Its definitely difficult not to compare myself to my coworkers who are all publishing... I cope with it a couple ways. 1) pushing other people out of my mind. Comparisson isn't constructive and only makes you feel bad, which is de-motivating. On bad days, this means that I skip meetings to focus on my own stuff. But so what?

Rather than just suffering and studying frantically in my free time, I think its better to learn how to say \"I don't know (but I will look it up/but could you explain that/but we can look into it together/etc)\". Its a breath of fresh air when people are honest. Also its not a RACE to learn everything?? The \"til you make it part\" is important to. You'll get there over time.

My experience with supervisors like this is that you really need to assert yourself and insist on their attention (always politely, of course) in order to get what you need. Be persistent. Send them an email and write that you would like to discuss the content of and plan for your thesis (in a polite, professional, non-aggressive manner). You are a trainee, it is your supervisor's job to make sure you graduate, and the quality of your thesis reflects upon them as well. So it is in their interest to put a concrete plan in place at this stage.\n\nYou mentioned they don't understand every detail of your project, and this meeting is not really the time to bring them up to speed. You need to prepare a \"pitch\" essentially, e.g., \"\\[this\\] is the work I have done so far, and \\[this\\] is why it is important..., \\[this\\] is the work I will do next over \\[XYZ\\] time frame..., and \\[this\\] is how I plan to organize my thesis\". Determine an approximate time frame that you will aim to complete the writing of your thesis. Then you both can have a discussion/negotiation about the content without getting into the small details. \n\nI suspect the uncertainty of everything is what is the real cause of your anxiety, so setting expectations and concrete goals with your supervisor will make you feel better. It would be good to send a follow-up email right after the meeting listing everything you discussed so that you can have it in writing in case they \"forget\" or change their mind later without a good reason. If your committee has been formed, you could CC your committee members on this email.\n\nIf your committee is not formally arranged yet, I suggest you do that ASAP. You can also get advice/feedback from your other committee members when your supervisor is absent. They will eventually have a say in whether you pass, after all, so having their opinion in hand will help you.\n\nYou have come so far already, you will not fail your PhD. Just keep going, take it day-by-day, keep in communication with your supervisor as much as you can, and try to remove as much uncertainty surrounding your thesis as possible.

I've felt the same things you've expressed here in the comments. I've felt bad that I have to turn down friends' consistent requests to spend more time together. I've felt frustrated with them for not understanding what I do and frustrated with myself for being frustrated. I've dumped hours into spending time with people and then a few more hours recuperating from these types of emotions, but then they still can't provide the support I need. I feel it's unfair. I'd like to be perfectly pleasant, available, and humble all the time but I'm not, I need support too. So I've decided that SOME friendships aren't worth the investment and I need to back away from them. I have to be efficient with regards to which friendships I spend my emotional energy on. I explained this to my young cousin because she wants to go to grad school and now she thinks I'm a heartless, cold, arrogant, socially inept caricature of an academic. I swear I'm not. I'm was a pretty nice and extraverted person before I started the program, now I'm just short on time and energy for everyone else and I need to spend it on me. \n\nIt sounds like your neighbors are nice, but nice isn't the only quality you need in a friend. Friendship is a two-way street, so maybe someone with more time is a better fit for them and someone with more understanding of academia (or the willingness to learn about it) is a better fit for you? I mean sure, it's always good to befriend people different from you, and sometimes a fit can be developed and understanding can be built...but will that happen with your neighbors one day?  \n\nUnfortunately sometimes it's hard to find friends where you've relocated for your PhD and you have to settle for the best you can find. If it's a small place, you may have trouble finding anyone who has experiences to relate to you. I personally really struggle to find female friends who are academics or other people from underrepresented groups who understand the specific struggle I'm going through. That's why I love online communities. I go find some academic comics or posts or something where people have expressed the same frustrations I have, and then I feel not alone. \n\nAlso everyone here telling you to improve your communication skills or your emotion regulation skills sounds pretty condescending to me. You tagged this as a \"vent,\" not a \"feedback session.\" We get enough of that from peer reviews and our faculty...

PhDs are geared toward academia and research.  Are those her interests?\n\nIf she is more interested in clinical practice, like being a nurse practitioner, then the DNP would be more suitable. \n\nAlso, nursing is SO HUGE.  She isn't limited to the OR, to acute care, to whatever.  I know there is a job out there that she would like better.  That's why I love the field of nursing - if I got bored or was no longer content, I'd find a new position.  I have been a nurse for over 10 years, and a full time professor for 1.5 years.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n* No, PhD programs are not always paid for by the university.  Nursing is not a typical PhD program.  Yes, there are fully funded programs out there.  But I went to a R1 University and I didn't know of any PhD students in my department who were fully funded.  That is a good question she should ask and search for opportunities.  There are options like pre-docs that will fund provide you with tuition and a stipend, but be warned it is a big pay cut from a nursing salary.  A lot of nurses go back to get their PhDs later in life, after they are done with their nursing careers, and get a PhD while working.  That is what I did.  Not a lot of nurses go straight from BSN-PhD, although they are certainly trying to increase these numbers.  \n* I finished my PhD in three years.  I know of someone who did it one semester less than me.  I know some people who are pushing 6 years.  It does really depend on the student, the program, the dissertation project. \n* Job prospects are good for nursing professors, in general.  It's one of the few areas in academia with a shortage.  Before I even finished my dissertation I had calls for nearly every job I applied to, interviewed with several and started a position as a TT professor.  There are opportunities in community colleges, liberal art colleges and universities.  Nursing professors are generally older in age, as I said before a lot of people make this career switch later in life, so a lot of nursing professors are going to be retiring soon and we need more.\n* I can't really speak to the career opportunities for nurse researchers.  Most research is done out of universities, by nursing professors who compete for grants and lead programs of research.  But there certainly are opportunities to work in other jobs such as nurse scientists, nurse research roles in hospitals, and program managers that work for agencies that fund grants.  There are other niche jobs like medical science liasions as well that work for medical device and pharmaceutical companies and act as subject matter experts.   My understanding is all of these jobs would be highly competitive.\n* Salary - really depends.  You can make good money as a nurse.  I'd say that I make the same as a new nursing professor with a PhD as I did on the night shift with an occasional overtime shift on the floor.  BUT the difference in work life balance is tremendously different - instead of being a slave to the hospital schedule, the 12 hour shifts, the holidays and weekends, I now have a lot of flexibility, can work from home sometimes, etc.  As a mom with a young son this is worth it's weight in gold to me.  I definitely think my earning potential is better in the long run with a PhD, as long as academia doesn't crumble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps, feel free to PM me or ask here if you have additional questions.

I have seen people other than I do career shifts and field changes, so I hope I can share something.\n\nFor advice,\n\n&gt;I know there\u2019s no big secret and if I spend enough time studying / practicing the technical concepts I would be able to build my experience, but at the same time I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s sufficient, this late on in my education.\n\nI do not know where you are from and what does your program expects from their PhD students. But if it were similar to my experience, Bachelors will be 2 years general education and 2 years focused on your field. Masters will be 2 full years focused on your field. Say a year from your current education is transferrable. Would you have 3 years to cover the gaps on your own what others have done with some supervision? A mistake self-taughts might bring themselves to is to get all the books, read them all, and try to cover everything. That would feel intimidating and may actually be counter-productive. For some technical fields, books can only get you so far. Also, even if you do your Bachelors and Masters in the same field, you are not very likely to cover everything. And even if you did, you would have forgotten a huge chunk of it when you reach PhD. If you already have your PhD proposal in place, I would suggest that you find someone who could give you an idea on where to start studying and advice on how to go about it. Otherwise, it will be easy to go directionless and feel defeated for doing so much for almost nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I\u2019m wondering whether the technical stuff seems cooler and more interesting to *everyone*, and we *all* kinda (secretly or outwardly) wish we could work in those fields, but the fact is that some of us just aren\u2019t cut out for it?\n\nIt is possible for someone to have an interest in technical stuff but maybe not cut for it. But... Not everyone is interested in the technical stuff, and I find people who thought they are not cut for it succeed. You won't really know until you try. Also, you may need to acknowledge that it can be a spectrum and not binary. Finally, the struggle can move in the opposite direction, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Am I crazy for thinking that motivation and interest are enough?\n\nEven if you are the most prepared, motivation and interest as you may already know are not enough. That is why impostor syndrome is very prevalent.

The further I got into my field I realized what I really loved was research (I would definitely be happy doing years of full time research). I was naturally interested in entrepreneurship and economics so I would continually read journals on those subjects. A professor in the entrepreneurship department saw my potential and let me assist his research.\n\nIn terms of data collection and analysis the only other experience I have is creating market research and analysis reports. I have done 9 reports through internships.\n\n I am not planning on applying for a few years (until my business can run without me so my dedications aren't split).\n\n I currently don't know any top researchers so at the moment getting a recommendation is not likely.

It's super important to have an emergency fund that you can rely on when your school is shitty at paying you.\n3. Get a tutoring job! If you are a Ph.D. student, you can ask for quite a lot of money per hour. I first worked for an in-person tutoring company that kids went to after school, and then I switched to an in-home tutoring agency that paid me $50/hour for any class that was not AP, which I got $55/hour for. In both cases, I did it weekday evenings and weekends just scheduled around my laboratory work for grad school. I made around $200-500 per month which I put away into my high-interest savings as well. Now, I can make a Craigslist post outlining my experience, and make money pretty much guaranteed. I have a reference parent that I can hit up to get a reference from, too.\n4. I don't drink, go out, etc. and really only spend money on groceries at this point.

Sometimes, profs like to ask you edge cases which fail under the assumptions you had in order to build mathematical formulations, and for that, you need to have your fundamentals in automode in the back of your head =]\n\nWhoops.\nW.r.t. some other questions, Check my other comment ;-)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hh1g64/quals_engineering_fundamentals/fwinkpp/"}, "3278": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "fleeingslowly", "Date": 1593552629, "Score": 5, "Body": "There's a lab in my department that only a couple people have access to, and not my advisor.
