In some country the path to citizenship is generally less steep for highly paid worker.

Basically, I had a pretty significant falling out with my advisor after my second semester (of a 4 year program - so I wasn't as far along as you) and I couldn't see a way to fix the relationship without destroying myself to live up to my advisor's always changing standards. Basically the work I did would never be good enough, even more so after I stood up to him. I was lucky enough that the graduate program advisor was aware of my situation and willing to help me find a way out. I reached out to a couple of people at the university to talk about my project ideas and get a feel for whether they could take me on as a student. I wound up finding someone in a different department who was willing to take me in. They were fantastic and super supportive and I wound up getting a second master's degree because I was getting away from my actual research interests. As I was working on the master's project, I found a new PhD elsewhere that really excited me and was able to start once I finished. When I reached out, I was also pretty open about the fact that I had a falling out with my advisor, so that's why I left and had other people who could vouch for me as a person/student - I never went into details because of professionalism (admittedly my position is a bit more vulnerable - you can't keep switching programs so if this doesn't work I don't think that I'll ever get a PhD).\n\nI officially left my lab and bad advisor at the end of the second semester because I wanted to fulfill my RA contract (and be able to have a TA contract the next semester). I did it over email, but at that point we had a terrible relationship, so in person was out of the question for me. Because of how things ended with my first PhD advisor I wouldn't ask him for a reference letter.

Are other groups open for people stuck at their former PhDs? How much of disadvantage it represents? Should I quit current and then apply for another or vice versa?\n\nI've seen people constantly talk about their PhD as if it's the end-all-be-all for their careers. That the work they're doing in their PhD will define their lives and careers.\n\nIt's important to understand what you're exactly doing: The PhD, grad school, is a training program. The work should matter, but it really comes second to gaining the training to do independent critical research. Regardless of whether you stay in academia or not, the skills you obtain during that training process *will* help you in the future, so long as you take the lessons you need to do so.\n\nI think the problem usually is that students (and honestly, faculty are really guilty of this) focus so much on techniques more than independent and critical thought that it clouds their abilities and goals. You see it mentioned here, and I've started seeing it more and more with students, where the focus is so much on knowing a technique rather than the ability to answer a question. \n\nIt doesn't help that there's much wrong with academia today, especially with the wrong incentives by professors, the lack of adequate training for students, the treating of the entire enterprise as a business run by simply large highs without adequate support and unrealistic expectations. And unfortunately, you're taught to simply look at projects rather than thinking more big-picture in ways that others may not see those needs.\n\nMix that with your interests also change with time. You're likely in your 20s going through the process, and are changing your views on what is important and not. You recognize niches that need to be filled, inadequacies of systems, things to fix. It becomes more and more frustrating how damaged the system has become, and there's no real \"training\" or even acknowledgement that these things need to happen. \n\nThat said, some things to think about:\n\n&gt;Almost two thirds in my PhD, I realized it's pointless to continue; I'm not a right fit at this institute and they don't have the expertise and willingness to guide me.\n\nI'll be honest and say I'm terrible at pep talks. You know, usually that burst of dopamine by someone telling you \"you can do it\" just lasts for about 15 seconds before you come crashing again.\n\nWhat I can offer is perhaps a different way of looking at this. One person's trash is another person's treasure. \n\nI look at this as a daunting, but also exciting problem, one that *you* would have to solve independently. How comfortable you are with guiding yourself through open waters to find the answer is really the question. There simply may not be anyone else to help you find this solution. Staying in the program and figuring that out can be a way of helping you get your PhD granted. Not wanting to figure that out, not wanting to go through that discomfort, wanting more structure in the solutions, is something you'd have to figure out if you want.\n\nIf you're in your 4th year especially, you start running into this conundrum. Like in an ocean by yourself expecting someone to help guide you through that. Sometimes, you just have to swim in a direction, because there really are no right answers. And it's super uncomfortable and irritating and upsetting. It fucking sucks, feels lonely. Interest and dedication alone aren't enough to go through this process. \n\nBut it's a situation in which you are forced to be creative, literally in the sense, to find the answers. It requires you to be destroyed in order to remake yourself to be able to solve the problem. It's a horrible, emotional process, and when you figure it out on your terms, you become someone new, someone stronger in the end. \n\nOtherwise, if you're more wanting your hand held to have the guidance, you'd be getting a Masters, not a PhD. I'm not saying this to downplay people's situations, but to reframe how to look at your program and situation.\n\n&gt;Are other groups open for people stuck at their former PhDs? How much of disadvantage it represents? Should I quit current and then apply for another or vice versa?\n\nI had a great graduate mentor that was not an expert in the field I was looking at. We had a phenotype in a completely different system.\n\nI didn't learn the facts from him. I read papers to do that.\n\nWhat I learned was how to approach the problem, how to ask the questions, and how to reach out to others to try and seek out those answers. I learned how to be independent and think independently. I didn't care about \"staying in academia\"; that was a different problem and career choice made later on. When we were *both* stuck, my old mentor always thought of it as an opportunity. A puzzle to solve. And it didn't click to me until my third year that the reason I was even doing this, the purpose of this, was because *literally nobody else had done it before*.\n\nDuring my postdoc, I was a lot more cognizant on the failings of the system, and said fuck it, I'm going my own way because I had little to lose. But that training I had earlier was incredibly valuable to be able to work through such a large problem that got some substantial success.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ovcrq5/getting_out_of_a_phd_after_almost_two_years_is/h7bhza8/"}, "38": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "HungoverHippy42", "Date": 1627831415, "Score": 1, "Body": "Oh, dear.

My main recommendations as a fourth year, wet lab-based, UK PhD student are these (roughly from more to less important):\n\n**- Start in a group where there is already expertise in the field or project that you are going to study.** For two/three years I was the only PhD student in my lab (no postdocs either), which was not only more difficult emotionally but also made it really hard to work as I had to learn most techniques by myself. In this line, do not start projects or side projects where neither you nor any close colleagues or collaborators have 0 experience at. I spent years on failed experiments partly because I decided to go for projects from different fields to those my supervisor could help me with. Maybe you are a genius and this does not apply to you, but the right group will make your work much easier and better in any case.\n\n**- Look for people to collaborate with either in or outside your group.** Even when you know what you are doing, most projects require knowledge and practise of different techniques. Your project is going to be yours and only yours, but it is a good idea to share parts of it or even \"outsource\" experiments. For instance, if your PhD and expertise is mostly computational but you need to do a few cell studies to validate something, look for someone that can do those for you instead of learning a whole new technique that may be of limited use to you in the future (or at least do it with that somenone to learn faster and better).\n\n**- Make sure the lab you end up in is not isolated from other labs.** Unless it is a really big lab, it's really important that your group is well connected and has good relations with different groups in the same department/institute/university... Also active collaborations with groups from other universities or companies are cool. It is a nice question to ask in an interview I think.\n\n\\- **Visit the lab/offices before, during or after your interview and ask around how it is there.** You will get more or less sincere answers, but you'll get a taste of how healthy the relations are there and how well you will fit in. This is important both for your mental health and wellbeing and for your work as labs thrive when its members help each other.\n\n**- Expect frustration and disappointments and don't let those make you miserable.** Your project may be shit and you may be having to write a shitty thesis, but your PhD is not your life and it is very unlikely that you'll fail the course anyway. Keep your worry levels in check and when the anxiety is too much, talk with your supervisor, advisor, a psychologist... Everyone in academia goes through these feelings and there are great techniques to manage anxiety and academic despair.\n\n**- If you start a PhD, you should be aiming to finish it.** That does not mean that you should not quit for anything in the world, your mental health goes first and everyone is entitled to change their mind. Just do not start a PhD thinking \"It's fine, I'll just quit after a year if I don't like it\". It can look pretty bad in your CV (unless you had a mental/physical health or other serious issues) and it will also be very negative for your group and supervisor.\n\n\\- **Do NOT create a reddit account when you should be writing your thesis.** Just don't.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ovubz2/phd_students_what_do_you_wish_someone_told_you/h7bt7k2/"}, "45": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "fuzzy_feltz", "Date": 1627835487, "Score": 10, "Body": "My friend and I who are both biology PhD students in the UK and we shared some of the things we wish we'd known in this podcast episode.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/2x2r6bwTHhsjHNtKrbwuPa?si=fjsBukAdSd-sycwhPa8dzA&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1\n\nBut I would personally say I wish I'd known how hard it was going to be.

Think about the tasks you spend time on as a PhD: there is a bunch of stuff you simply have to do every week/month/year, and this doesn't scale with part-time work.  You may still have to attend weekly group meetings and departmental research seminars, present at annual conferences, work as a TA, and that's quite possibly all at the same level as the full-time students.  Plus you now have 8 years of literature to keep up-to-date on, instead of 3, so a larger fraction of your time will be spent reading papers, dragging your work out even longer.

PhDs are inherently stressful, but they are significantly MORE stressful for Americans. For one, many don't have a separate masters, instead having to do a masters as a part of their PhD, which IMO is detrimental. Not only that, but many do not have adequate funding, while most of us in the EU get paid a salary to do a PhD. I treat my PhD as a job, and I act as an employee of the university (because I am one). My friends in the US aren't so lucky. The reason I bring this up is, **a lot of advice that PhD candidates have does not translate well across the Atlantic, and given this site is predominately filled with Americans, much of the PhD advice you get is fairly off base**. \n\n* **Your supervisor is the biggest factor in whether or not you enjoy your PhD and honestly, whether or not you finish it**. I've met PhDs who struggle to even get meetings with their supervisor (especially if their supervisor is head of an institute - I feel so sorry for them). Meanwhile, those of us with regular weekly meetings with our supervisors, who can get support and advice when we need it, and are overall provided with a reasonable work load given our status genuinely can enjoy the experience.\n\n* **Vacations are important**. This is one of those pieces of advice that doesn't translate across the Atlantic, luckily I'm on the same side of the ocean as you are. As an American, I've been largely raised to be flippant about taking vacations. I didn't realize what I difference they can make. I felt like I was slowing down massively, so I just took a week off.

Again, doesn't translate across the Atlantic. I read so much advice from American PhDs before I started mine, and I was really worried.

I work at most 40 hours a week. I don't work weekends and I take regular vacations. The only time I work overtime is if I have an immediate deadline (and then I work fewer hours after the deadline is reached). My project isn't a passion project of mine, my PhD is a job. That's how I see it, and that's a major component of my stress management. I highly recommend that you find a position where you can do this, because if you personalize your work too much, you're going to find it a lot more stressful.

Also, you may be surprised how much additional learning you get during teaching, i.e. lesson planning, curriculum development, bolstering some specialised practical skills etc. Plus the extra money is always good. Your contacts from teaching may even help you find a future teaching post, with references etc. \n\nHowever, a word of caution: tread very lightly when taking on teaching duties. Always operate within your programme guidelines. If they tell you to stick to a given number of hours per week/academic year, do that. Failing to adhere to this will not only impact your research but also cause some complications for your examination at the end of the programme. You'll do very well to stick to a maximum of 6-8 hours during term time, so that you may progress well with your research. \n\nAlso, if you can pick up formal training qualifications while teaching, take each and every one of them!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ovubz2/phd_students_what_do_you_wish_someone_told_you/h7desw8/"}, "142": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ueyg", "Date": 1627865418, "Score": 3, "Body": "That it's a big decision.

Made for some really interesting situations and moments during my postdoc.\n\nIf you talk to most professors, they'll either deny the politics exist (in which case, they're usually lying and are the cause of most drama) or they'll try to \"shield\" their people from the politics. It's something usually not spoken about or really taught, because professors themselves are often terrible at the entire ordeal. But deal-making, collaboration, collegiality all require a knowledge of how to handle the political arena. It's good to learn who you can trust, who you can't trust, how to handle tense situations, and how to go about your day. \n\nI don't envy the favorite because of the expectations and pressures, *with the exception* that the favoritism is tied directly to a project and not to an individual. That might sound very odd, but one thing I personally learned was that shifting popularity onto a project lets off pressure on you, the individual. But it's not always possible.\n\nEDIT: I will echo something a friend told me years ago. You don't want to be the favorite. Mostly because there's more that will be expected out of you, and any failure that happens will result in magnitudes higher higher repercussions regardless of whether it is your fault or not.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ovubz2/phd_students_what_do_you_wish_someone_told_you/h7jpqbz/"}, "263": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "theChaosBeast", "Date": 1627995353, "Score": 10, "Body": "I can confirm.

Afterwards, his professor at the University of St. Gallen wants nothing more to do with him - she fears she will no longer get a visa. \n\n&gt;When Oliver Gerber* first hears that his tweets could cost him his future doctorate, he is sitting in his old nursery. It is 28 March 2020, 9:50 p.m. Gerber's mailbox receives an email from his supervisor at the University of St. Gallen (HSG). Subject: \"Very urgent: complaint from China about your Twitter\".\n\n&gt;Gerber clicks on the email on his smartphone. The professor writes that she has received \"excited mails from China\": Gerber is spreading \"neo-Nazi-like content\" on Twitter. This is dangerous, even for her: \"In the end, even I might not be able to get a visa for China because of you. That is definitely going too far and I would have to end our mentoring relationship.\" She said he should immediately moderate his political language in public. She has \"no desire to receive such emails because of one of my doctoral students\".\n\n&gt;Oliver Gerber has to read the message twice. He has been tweeting for ten days, less than ten people follow him. Sure, he has sharply criticised the Chinese government. For example, on 21 March, he posted in English: \"The Chinese Communist Party made the fight against Covid-19 Plan B. It would only come to fruition if the Chinese government were to take action against Covid-19. This would only come into play if plan A - cover-up - failed. This is how paranoid cowards act. They have earned neither my respect nor my gratitude. #ChinaLiedPeopleDied\".\n\n&gt;This is supposed to be \"neo-Nazi-like\" content? Gerber believes there is a misunderstanding. He replies at 11 pm, wants to know who the \"excited emails from China\" are from. He asks whether his professor has even read the tweets. And he accuses her of having \"fallen for the increasingly aggressive Chinese censorship\". Nevertheless, he deactivates his Twitter account.\n\n&gt;Oliver Gerber hears nothing for almost 48 hours. Then the professor contacts him again. Her tone is distant, she does not answer Gerber's questions. She copies the second supervisor of the thesis and writes that she wishes him good luck with his \"Chinese studies\". And further: there \"is no supervisory relationship between you and us.\"\n\n&gt;It is the last email Gerber will receive on his HSG account. The next day he no longer has access to the messages. An IT technician tells him on the phone that his account doesn't even exist. Gerber says, \"It felt like I was eliminated overnight.\"\n\n&gt;Education is central to China's global power strategy. The Chinese government wants to control the image the world has of the country. To do so, it exerts influence abroad - and does not shy away from repression. At the beginning of the year, the Chinese Foreign Ministry banned all researchers from the largest research institute specialised in China in Europe from entering the country. Such demonstrations of power intimidate researchers worldwide - especially if they depend on travelling to China for work. This can lead them to pre-emptively avoid critical topics.\n\n&gt;Cooperation between Swiss and Chinese universities is close, with over fifty cooperation agreements now in place. Swiss people benefit from stays abroad and can access large amounts of data in research, for example to develop cancer therapies. But what is the price of this cooperation?\n\n&gt;There are only a few people in Switzerland who disclose and criticise attempts at Chinese influence at universities. Oliver Gerber's case shows, however, that China's aggressive foreign policy can influence how scientists in Switzerland express themselves publicly and how they deal with critical votes from their students. It shows that some scientists are prepared to restrict themselves and others in order not to anger China.\n\n&gt;Oliver Gerber's name is actually different. Because his partner's family lives in China and expects repression if his name appears in the newspaper, he wants to remain anonymous. For this reason, the professor is also not mentioned by name. The NZZ has spoken to both sides.\n\n&gt;Gerber accuses the HSG of kicking him out because of his critical tweets. The NZZ has copies of these tweets as well as Gerber's correspondence with the professor and other HSG representatives. They largely support the position of the former doctoral student. The University of St. Gallen, however, insists on a different version: Gerber himself had decided not to study at the HSG anymore.\n\n&gt;How does the HSG justify this? From whom did the professor receive the \"excited emails from China\"? And what does this mean for freedom of opinion and research in Switzerland?\nThe background\n\n&gt;Oliver Gerber has a background in science, and you can tell by the way he tells his story: structured, meticulously documented and with distance. As if it had all happened to someone else.\n\n&gt;The fact that the events nevertheless keep him very busy is shown by how often he repeats: \"I can't believe that something like this happened in Switzerland.\" His three-year research effort: destroyed because of a tweet.\n\n&gt;In spring 2017, Gerber begins his doctoral studies at the HSG. His research is in the field of environmental pollution. His topic is sensitive for China, yet it is clear to Gerber early on: he wants to understand the country, wants to do research on the ground and not from his desk in St. Gallen. He applies for scholarships and is supported by his supervisor. In the letter of recommendation she writes: \"He is capable of pursuing a high-profile research career.\"\n\n&gt;Gerber gets a scholarship from the Chinese government at a university in Wuhan - for three years, instead of just one as originally planned. He flies to Wuhan in September 2018, quickly makes friends and falls in love.\n\n&gt;A Chinese professor finds his doctoral topic \"boring\" - a euphemism for too critical of the government. He also has to attend courses for his scholarship and cannot believe how much censorship shapes everyday university life. When he submits an essay on re-education camps, he receives the lowest grade. In an email to his professor in St. Gallen he writes: \"Maybe I just had bad luck.\"", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oxb5vf/no_doctorate_because_of_a_tweet_the_chinese_far/h7l9j7v/"}, "305": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "advanced-DnD", "Date": 1628019963, "Score": 1, "Body": "&gt;How China is making an impact through education\n\n&gt;China has become a popular destination for students from all over the world before the pandemic. In 2018, their number was almost half a million. Just under 13 per cent received a scholarship from the Chinese government. For this, China specifically selects students from countries where it has political interests.\n\n&gt;China's economy is growing rapidly. In terms of foreign policy, the country is becoming increasingly aggressive. Western media constantly report on human rights violations such as the prison camps in Xinjiang. All this raises fears about China. The government is aware of this.\n\n&gt;But it also knows that China's history fascinates many. That is why China has set up the Confucius Institutes. There are more than 500 of them worldwide, in over 150 countries. Located on the campuses of foreign universities, the institutes are supposed to teach Chinese language and culture. They are subordinate to the Chinese Ministry of Education, which provides staff and funds. In Switzerland, there is only one such institute, at the University of Geneva. The second was located at the University of Basel and was closed last autumn.\n\n&gt;In the USA, too, every fourth Confucius Institute has been closed down in recent years. Universities no longer wanted to lend legitimacy to an institution that defended fundamentally different values. While in the West freedom of research and freedom of expression are important basic principles, education in China is heavily politicised under the rule of state and party leader Xi Jinping. For example, the prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai has replaced the term freedom of expression in its statutes with \"Xi Jinping's socialist ideology\".\n\n&gt;The momentous decision\n\n&gt;Oliver Gerber flies back to Switzerland shortly before Christmas 2019, originally planning only a short family visit. But then the coronavirus pandemic breaks out. On 23 January, a strict lockdown is imposed on Wuhan. Gerber stays in Switzerland. He begins to think about what to do after his doctorate. His girlfriend advises him to network on social media.\n\n&gt;Before Gerber opens a Twitter account, he seeks advice from his professor because he knows she is active on the social network. He asks by email: \"Do you engage in a certain degree of self-censorship? Do you think it would be too dangerous for me to open a Twitter account?\"\n\n&gt;Although he receives no reply, he starts tweeting in mid-March. At that time, China is in focus as the site of the Corona pandemic outbreak. Gerber sees his chance to position himself as a China expert. At the same time, he is also emotionally affected by what is happening in Wuhan - the city to which he wants to return, where he has friends and a partner. His Twitter channel becomes an outlet: he criticises the Chinese government's initial cover-up of the Corona epidemic, the repression in Xinjiang and Xi Jinping.\n\n&gt;When his girlfriend sees some of the tweets, she is shocked. She asks him on the phone to stop. Not because she disagrees with everything. But because she is afraid of repression from the Chinese government. \"I am in Switzerland, not in China,\" he replies. \"Here I can say what I want.\"\n\n&gt;Swiss universities and their China connection\n\n&gt;Cooperation between Chinese and Swiss universities has expanded in recent years. The HSG has fifteen agreements, almost twice as many as the ETH. The HSG has also had a \"China Competence Center\" for eight years, whose goal is to \"strengthen and deepen productive relations with China\". Upon request, St. Gallen states that it has never encountered problems in cooperations with Chinese universities.\n\n&gt;Last year, the Swiss intelligence service warned in a situation report against Chinese spies masquerading as students or researchers. Recently, the links between Swiss universities and China were also an issue in parliament. Two parliamentarians asked about the principles and guidelines of cooperation. The Federal Council replied that the universities themselves had to weigh up which cooperations they entered into. There was no \"concrete feedback of influence in the sense of curtailing academic freedoms\".\n\n&gt;Ralph Weber, China expert and professor at the University of Basel, criticises Swiss universities for often not doing enough research on their foreign partners - especially the Chinese ones. In some sectors of the economy, he says, it is normal to examine the constraints under which a partner functions when making important business deals. \"I miss such a procedure at many universities.\"\n\n&gt;In Weber's view, clear rules and, above all, red lines are needed. Otherwise there is a great danger that Swiss universities will say to themselves: \"This is China, there's no way around it. And therefore compromise on their own values. The Swiss universities seem to have recognised the problem: Within the framework of the umbrella organisation of Swiss universities, they want to develop joint guidelines for cooperation with China for the first time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oxb5vf/no_doctorate_because_of_a_tweet_the_chinese_far/h7l9zeu/"}, "306": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "advanced-DnD", "Date": 1628020099, "Score": 1, "Body": "&gt;The conflict\n\n&gt;After Gerber reads the email in which his professor writes that there is \"no longer a supervisory relationship\", he desperately turns to his father. He contacts a lawyer. On the advice of his girlfriend, Oliver Gerber compiles a dossier of e-mails between himself and his most important contacts at the HSG that same evening. His lawyer writes several letters to the university management in the coming weeks. \n\n&gt;Gerber's goal is to be able to continue studying at the HSG. But the university argues that the professor did not kick him out, but that he had long since been exmatriculated at his own request. In fact, Gerber will only be enrolled at the Chinese university from the autumn semester 2019, not at the HSG. The manager of the doctoral programmes at the HSG had advised him to do so. He wrote by email that this way the maximum duration for the degree could not expire while Gerber was in China. \"De-registration also gives you every choice.\" Re-matriculation is like a new application, he said - but with the support of his professor, it's not a problem.\n\n&gt;Gerber follows this advice and temporarily de-registers in St. Gallen. The programme manager writes: \"A wise decision.\" On the university website, Gerber continues to be listed as a doctoral student for the time being. The professor supervises him as before - until she complains about his tweet. For example, she asks him to send an outline after a Skype meeting. On 21 February 2020, a few weeks before she declares the supervisory relationship non-existent, she writes: \"It's great how well you've already progressed in China!\"\n\n&gt;Although Gerber can document all this, in spring 2020 the university sticks to its position that he had long since ceased to be an HSG doctoral student when the breach occurred because of his tweets. The university's ombudsman also does not want to deal with the case for this reason. The HSG informed Gerber that he would have to reapply completely if he wanted to continue his studies. And that he would have to look for a new professor who would supervise him.\n\n&gt;The professor only told the NZZ which tweet the \"excited emails from China\" referred to and who they were from when asked. She had received a message from a Chinese doctoral student who was doing research at a Canadian university. The e-mail is available to the NZZ, but the name of the sender has been blacked out - according to the professor at the request of the author.\n\n&gt;The author accuses Gerber of a \"racist attack on the Chinese people\". He refers to a specific tweet: a cartoon that Gerber had posted in response to another user's tweet. It shows a cartoon character who has been altered and has stereotypical Chinese features: yellow skin tone, slit eyes. In spring 2020, this drawing circulated on social media and was deemed racist by some users. Gerber says he only shared the cartoon because of its political message. The subject is China's stance on Taiwan and Hong Kong. \"In retrospect, I realise that I did not question the portrayal of the Chinese person enough.\"\n\n&gt;The professor says she pointed out to Gerber that he was no longer allowed to pretend to be an HSG doctoral student on Twitter because he had exmatriculated the previous year. \"This has absolutely nothing to do with the issues of China or censorship.\" It was an oversight that she wrote in the plural of \"excited emails from China\", although she had only received one email - from Canada. She had wanted to make it clear that further reactions were to be expected. The formulation \"then I would have to end the supervisory relationship\" had referred to the informal counselling she had provided \"at the request of the doctoral student\". The fact that Gerber had been listed as such on the HSG website until the end of March was simply due to an omission.\n\n&gt;he professor further explained that the relationship of trust had been strained because Gerber had \"lost his temper\" during a conversation a year earlier and had told her that he no longer wanted to continue his doctorate at the HSG in any form and no longer needed her as a doctoral supervisor. Gerber denies this. He had only once considered pursuing a double degree from both universities. In the emails between the two from 2019, which are available to the NZZ, there is no indication of tensions.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oxb5vf/no_doctorate_because_of_a_tweet_the_chinese_far/h7lab37/"}, "307": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "advanced-DnD", "Date": 1628020149, "Score": 1, "Body": "&gt;Whether the professor received \"excited emails from China\", as she herself wrote, cannot be assessed conclusively. However, China can also exert pressure with its visa issuance policy. The professor's first email clearly shows that she feared she would no longer get a visa for China because of Gerber's tweets. This also explains how quickly she broke off contact - regardless of the fact that Gerber immediately deactivated his Twitter profile. Were there additional economic interests at play? The HSG says the professor's department never received any funds or other support from Chinese companies or other Chinese actors.\n\n&gt;The aftermath\n\n&gt;How does the HSG assess the case today? Prorector Ulrich Schmid says: \"The HSG is unreservedly committed to freedom of teaching and research. However, freedom of research is not affected in any way here, as it concerns private statements by the former doctoral student, which he published on a social network.\" The tweets could not be commented on. \"But the fact that they obviously caused great discussion and were perceived as racist justifies the professor's request to clearly distance herself from them.\"\n\n&gt;Schmid emphasises that Gerber's support after her de-registration was \"purely voluntary\" and had an \"informal character\". The professor was \"well within her rights\" to terminate this at any time if the relationship of trust was disturbed. Furthermore, Gerber had not submitted a complete application for re-registration, but had tried to force his re-registration.\n\n&gt;In the early summer of 2020, Gerber decided to abandon the legal efforts. He says he did not complete the matriculation application because he could not find a new supervisor: \"There was no other professor in the same department with whom I could have finished my thesis. Changing the subject would have meant starting from scratch again after three and a half years. That was out of the question for me.\"\n\n&gt;Gerber thought long and hard about whether to make the case public. He hopes for a debate about how China influences Swiss universities.\n\n&gt;Today Gerber says that he made a mistake when he started tweeting. That he could lose three years of research because of it still leaves him stunned. Yes, he had taken a path critical of China and once shared a caricature that he would no longer share today. \"But I didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\n&gt;Gerber has given up his doctorate. He says: \"I don't want to have to censor myself - certainly not in Switzerland.\" In the meantime, he has found a job that has nothing to do with China.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oxb5vf/no_doctorate_because_of_a_tweet_the_chinese_far/h7lafd3/"}, "308": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Conundrum5", "Date": 1628020223, "Score": 16, "Body": "+1 this. \nIf I were in your shoes, I would take two steps.

While at uni and doing my masters my PhD friends/colleagues always told me don\u2019t do PhD, they are miserable and were very interested in me (as i worked at a full time job while finishing the masters).  At least in my small circle my PhD peers wanted more money and were very stressed in general (I believe there is more to their misery but we never got into it too much as our chats try and be fun).  \n\n\u2026.Whereas I have felt like a bit of a quitter.  Ya ya. I finished the masters and that\u2019s great but parts of me is tempted to go back.  The PhD for me isn\u2019t about finding a job, it\u2019s a personal sense of accomplishment.  I can tell you finding a job is difficult for everyone. Not one person I know between grad school or undergrad had an easy time finding a job unless (in undergrad) they did coop through the school.   But anyway if I did a PhD. Maybe it would help transition my career as I work in a different engineering field than my masters.  \n\nIn summary I\u2019d say, yes PhD outlook is bleak.  Not any bleaker than any other degree (undergrad/grad).  My opinion is that we \u201call drink the koolaide\u201d and think some degree is the magical answer to big money.   Now (I do stem) and yes a degree is sort of a barrier to entry but entry level jobs are likely any other field in terms of pay \u2026 low lol.  \n\nI did have a professor once say if you feel the PhD makes you over qualified or holds you back then just omit putting it on a resume/job application.  That statement I feel is very powerful in itself.  It did solidify my opinion if I\u2019m doing this thing it\u2019s for me.  \n\nBut like you OP. I\u2019ll be mulling a PhD over for a while.  I\u2019ve been done the masters for a few years now.  Since then Life has gotten much more complex for me than before (young family, higher expenses, etc) so to commit to ~4 years of reduced income is a tough pill to swallow for today.  \n\nEven the ultra rare \u201cpart time\u201d PhD while working would be super tough, moving up at work caused longer and busier days and I look back and wonder how I ever managed to accomplish anything outside of work lol.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oxrx2v/i_want_to_do_a_phd_but_most_of_the_reviews_that_i/h7otbz2/"}, "412": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Kpopaddiction", "Date": 1628092018, "Score": 3, "Body": "You are so sorted.

If it is your loftiest goal and you can't imagine not doing it, no matter the sacrifice, becuase the consequence is always feeling unfulfilled. If you have doubts now they will amplify as you proceed through the program. Tepid enthusiasm at the beginning often makes it difficult to sustain through the program. And it become even more difficult to sustain the program with your psyche intact (I've been diagnosed with ptsd from this. Losing your mental well-being is not guaranteed, but is most definitely not uncommon). \n\nOn the other hand, teaching and mentoring at this level is so rewarding. After distancing myself from a difficult mentor environment I'm happy I persisted. A PhD is pretty much the only way to earn a PI position with a research lab. If you'd like to teach, but not have a research lab, there are positions that do not require a PhD.

You will, of course, find stories everywhere online about people who got their PhD in astrophysics and moved on to have a successful academic career or, even when academia didn't work out, how they moved into industry and used their expertise with data analysis successfully to land a high-paying Data Science job. *However*, do keep in mind at this point on your decision process that academic jobs are **very hard** to get, specially on this field. Unfortunately, industry does not lag behind and moving from academia to industry **can also prove to be extremely hard** and may very well end up unfruitful. \n\nAstrophysics are usually very skilled people (and typically very smart) but this is not enough to make you stand out in most positions these days, specially when other fields are getting more attention in the job market, and these fields have lots of overlapping skills with astrophysics *plus* a lot of specific skills that the latter does not have. For example, statistics is attracting lots of people to fill gaps in Data Science, a career that in the past absorbed a few astrophysicists. Programming was also an option in former days, but nowadays it is getting hard specially with lots of areas using programming, from biology to computer science, so you end up with a **lot** of PhDs that have some programming skills competing for jobs using this skill set.

Guess it was worth it, but I do definitely remember my quarter life crisis. \n\nAnyhow, I just turned 28 last month and I\u2019m starting my program in the fall. Before I accepted my offer, I also had some anxiety about the idea of being in school well into my 30s. Finally someone told me, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna turn 30 no matter what you do, you may as well make good use of your time by accomplishing your goals.\u201d It helped me relax a bit about the idea of being \u201ctoo old\u201d for a PhD program or worrying that it was too late somehow, that I was behind or that I was never going to catch up. Catch up to what?\n\nI constantly stress about running out of time in life. Especially since I\u2019m the only one of my closest friends who has pursued education this far. I see them working their 9 to 5s with their kids and their mortgages and I definitely worry about where I am in life. But I\u2019ve realized that working toward a PhD is different than just being \u201cin school.\u201d It\u2019s an investment in yourself and it\u2019s essentially a job. We\u2019re just a different kind of professional than our friends with more traditional life paths. It takes us longer, but the payoff is potentially greater.\n\nHonestly, what even is the value of a traditional life path anymore? You\u2019re not wasting time if you\u2019re doing work that you find fulfilling. Especially if you cultivate meaningful relationships with others along the way, which is probably the main point of living life in the first place. Thinking about that helps me cope with the constant ticking of my life\u2019s clock, like the one you described.\n\nTradition be damned, honestly. Most millennials can\u2019t afford to be homeowners and you\u2019ve already gone and done that! \n\nI also am feeling some guilt about leaving my family. I\u2019ve been living with them throughout my university studies in my hometown and I\u2019ve finally reached the point where my work and my personal and intellectual development have to be nurtured elsewhere. There definitely aren\u2019t any top-20 universities in my home state haha \n\nI always knew I\u2019d leave home at some point (and I\u2019m plenty old enough that I probably should have left long before this), but I\u2019m very close to my family and it doesn\u2019t feel great to leave them. There\u2019s pain and sadness mixed in with the guilt as we all get older and I leave to a city 1000 miles away. But my folks are pretty tough. My younger brother still lives here, and has no plans to leave yet. And it helps that I\u2019m much closer than when I was abroad. Being 4 hours away by plane seems like nothing compared to the trek between France and New Mexico \ud83d\ude02 I plan on being back home often, especially around holidays, and I will get my family to come visit me as often as possible. It\u2019s not easy, but sometimes we have to do what\u2019s right for us, even if it means a bit of distance from another part of ourselves.\n\nCongrats on your home, congrats on your admission to your program, and best wishes in your studies! Here we go!\n\nEdit: one last thought. You mention being tied to your new city for good, but don\u2019t forget that (market conditions permitting) you can always sell your home or rent it out.

I\u2019m doing my PhD for many, many reasons, but the most significant is that I cannot have the job or lifestyle I want for myself and my husband without it. To me, the PhD is a crucial part of building my life and it is something I am deeply committed to, and that my husband and family are deeply committed to. If you feel like you\u2019re being pulled two ways (school vs family), it\u2019s going to be much more difficult to complete on time. The whole thing is a marathon, and you will need a support network that is behind your commitment and decision 100%. I\u2019m very lucky that my husband, mom, and sister are all extremely committed to making everything in our lives shift to accommodate me while I\u2019m doing this for the next few years. My dad also had a PhD (passed unexpectedly a few years ago), and my mom and him kind of got the PhD in four years thing down to a science so I\u2019m speaking from privilege, as a disclaimer. We will do the same when my sister does her PhD or JD. Though this isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s experience, having my family on board for this has been immensely helpful and I couldn\u2019t do it without them. That said, it is me doing the work and the long nights, and committing to that piece can take some people longer than others. I\u2019ve known growing up that I want an academic lifestyle, since both of my parents were academics, hence I\u2019ve pretty much known I would do this since I was in middle school. I am by far and away the outlier in that, but it is a crucial piece of the PhD in the first year. You have to be married to it or you don\u2019t complete. It has to be your priority, and having that support network makes it all that much easier.\n\nEdit: I want to add that when my cohort mates and I do go out and socialize, usually, it\u2019s still within the context of the program. Your cohort mates will be great people for you to get to know personally, yes, but many of your socializing times will be more as friendly, supportive coworkers. When we go out for drinks, we talk about whose paper was just accepted where, who will be at which conference, TA duties, and bouncing research ideas off of one another.

I wouldn't send an entire research proposal unless they show interest in talking with you, though you could always mention that you have some ideas for a potential project. You DON'T want your email to seem generic, because then you won't seem interested, but you also don't want to give all your ideas away! Instead, mention some highlights from your CV and how that applies to their lab, or if you don't have a lot of work/research experience you can talk about why you're interested in going into that field, or if your bachelor's is in a slightly different field than the lab you are interested in (ex: my BA was in psychology, I am getting a PhD in animal science) you can talk about how your experiences influence the change in subject and how they will give you a unique perspective in the lab. Whatever the case, this should not be a long section; you should communicate this part in just a few sentences. If the email gets too long, they are less likely to read it. \n\nMake sure to ask if they have openings or will be looking for new students, because sometimes a PI can be really interested in you but not have an opening for the semester you were hoping for. Sometimes, they might point you towards a colleague who does have openings who you might not have considered. That is why it's best to be polite and professional; treat every email like a networking opportunity. If you make a good impression, they'll be more likely to want to help you out. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that professors are busy people and that you might not get a response right away. If it has been over a week without a response, you can always send another email at the beginning of the following week as a polite reminder that you are interested, but if you still don't hear back after this they may not be interested and you should probably move on. It's unfortunate, but it happens. \n\nAnother thing to note that I wish I had realized when I was first contacting professors was that the email you use matters. It should be obvious that you don't want to send professional inquiries from playjajadingdong@yahoo.com, but you may also want to look into sending emails only from a work or school email.

So please excuse if I say something redundant!) My two cents as I am struggling finishing my Theoretical Chemistry PhD: \n\nI am 33 now. I started my PhD journey at 25. I didn\u2019t have any material success until that point. It was academia and few research experiences (that doesn\u2019t pay!). For a lot of reasons, I am not there yet. I got a MS in between, a year of job, still on my PhD track though at the same University. Am I  exhausted? Wow. So much. I am a female not married without savings or a house nor many friends. I have all markers of \u201cfailures\u201d in today\u2019s definition of life. But I strive be authentic. And I am resilient in that pursuit. And I have learnt so much about me, how to be and I feel so much more honest in my pursuits today than I was at 25. Remember your brain has been growing until now. It\u2019s only now that it\u2019s fully developed. Regardless of experiences, maturity and success/failures. I value the honesty in pursuit and I am genuinely happy for that. On most days, I am tired and defeated. But I know deep down, I am not on the wrong path, just on the challenging one and a bit less popular maybe. It would be easier (so nice) to have a job paying me so I can have a house, savings, go on a holiday with my perfect family, help the society etc. And yes, those who have it also worked for it and it is important to them, so they are happy. So to the 25 year old me I would still ask to keep going! I will tell her, \u201cIt seems harder now. But don\u2019t worry about what others think or say, primarily. Try to be authentic. See what your values are. The instant gratification is not the real treasure. Unpleasant feeling is the growing pain. Be sincere and honest. Keep looking and trying.\u201d I wasn\u2019t able to be very centered though. Failures derailed me instantly emotionally and I needed a lot to get back. That was partially because of what would people think and less focus on my own belief in my values / efforts / potential. \n\nNow, do ask if you want to do PhD. And why so? To prove it to someone else or yourself? For a better job? For a better CV? To learn more? To be an expert? To learn to be an independent researcher? To have a better life? \n\nBut all these questions also, ask what YOU want, not what YOU think others want YOU to want. \n\nBecause age and time are ephemeral. The quality of what YOU is the important thing, IMO. And as cliche and cheesy, the journey is important too. In PhD especially you learn a lot in the journey. \n\nRegardless, good luck!\n\nIf I may suggest, try to find a mindfulness or meditation routine. It helps center your mind to the present which helps in decision making a lot, especially to not be influenced by thoughts and emotions which are not necessarily the reality just an impression.

I've been with my bf since my last year of bachelor's degree. So we've been through different stages of our relationship that were strictly correlated with our academic \"duties\": my bachelor's degree and his, my master's degree and his, my PhD. He went on to work in a corporation and didn't pursue a PhD. \n\nI think that the most important thing my bf understood from the very beginning is that for me this career path is not a job, or a school project. It's a passion. I love going to the lab and doing experiments just like other people might love cooking, or jogging, or video games, or, if lucky, your job. I don't go there to check some activities and working hours and get a paycheck. I go there because I enjoy every moment of it (ok, maybe not every single one, academia has a lot of skeletons in its closet) and being able to earn some money out of it is a major plus. The experiments I work on are like my babies. To give you an example, right now I'm on vacation and I still went there every day this week for a couple hours simply because there's something nagging me about a measurement and I can't just sit at home and pretend to relax without figuring it out first.\n\nThat being said, I always made a point in our relationship for time together. I always text my bf when I sit down to eat. And he does the same. If I'm in the middle of something and he calls, I'll either pick up, or call him as soon as I can. I always try to detach from work when I get home and spend some hours with my bf, talk about each others day or play something or watch a movie. That doesn't happen everyday, nobody's perfect. But even so, if he gets home from work and I'm focused on some paper or some data, he understands that. He'll come kiss me and then go cook something for the both of us. And even if he brings me the food to my desk every time, I still force myself to take a break and come join him to eat together. I also like to keep weekends as free as possible. I've discovered that if things aren't settled by Friday, the chance of figuring them out during the weekend are even slimmer. Since then my weekends have been waaaaay more relaxed. And if, let's say, there's some deadline or some reason to work on weekends, I always make a point in discussing that in advance with him so he can make other plans if he wishes to. \n\nHe does also one really amazing thing, whenever I'm overworked: he asks me about my research. Don't get scared of it, his training had nothing to with my research topics. But he'll sit there and listen, maybe ask questions, sometimes out of pure curiosity, sometimes really interesting things that I overlooked and it manages to also help me. And yes, the sometimes stupid questions, by academic standards (and even those are great, especially for my morale, and I never judged a stupid question from someone, especially him, because I know that there's not some inherent interest in the topic as it is his desire to help me). \n\nThat being said, these are things that came out of years of trials and errors. And I know a lot of people in academia making it work and a lot of people failing miserably. The compromises should be there for both of you. If you are both interested in this working out, try setting some ground rules, like an experiment (wink, pun intended). Decide to text eachother during lunch break, or spend an hour without any distractions everyday, or whatever you feel your relationship needs and see what works and what doesn't. \n\nStart with small things and work your way up. It's a working progress like everything else, and there is no set recipe. I'm perfectly aware that even us, as a couple, could still grow a lot. \n\n(By the way, relating to the lunch texts, don't expect love poems or anything, even our vary significantly from day to day. Sometimes it's a \"hey, how's your day?\", or an \"i miss you\", or a random \"love you\", or a \"that annoying girl is in the lab again\" or even a \"don't forget: toilet paper, mozzarella and toothpaste, see ya!\".

PhDs in the states are usually 5-7 years compared to 3-4 years on average elsewhere. That's because in the US you have some courses to follow and other requirements that act as the \"master\" portion of the program. It's a hidden master per se. That's why the option of \"mastering out\" in the US is so common and accepted while it's not usually as common/a wished outcome abroad.\n\nOutside of the US, PhDs are usually way shorter because they tend to traditionally require a master prior to entering the program and have no \"hidden master\" requirements to fullfill within the PhD program (even if you are accepted without a master in it!). \n\nThat being said, in the PhD programs outside of the US, you can \"truly skip\" (*) any master requiremwnts if you are a very good student or have relevant work experience as you said. However, it's not common in some countries like in Canada and some Universities might prevent it (my bachelor University wasnt allowing it last year).\n\n I am in that scenario; I did my bachelor in canada and I am now doing a PhD in a 3-4 years program without a Master. As a reference, I had a perfect GPA and had relevant work experience before graduating and a publication. I don't have any courses to attend or exam to pass other than defend my thesis. My studies are 100% research focus.\n\n* I say \"truly skip\" because In the US, it's uncommon that a PhD can be 3-4 years because of their \"hidden\" master requirements to fullfill during their PhD programs. In other words, completing a PhD without doing any of the typical master related work like you can do in other countries by skipping the master entirely and going directly to the PhD (with a shorter PhD time than the US average) is really not common in the US. So if you go to the US to do a PhD from undergrad, it will take longer compared to if you were able to skip the master entirely and do your Phd in another country.\n\nNote: Some fields like psychology will require to have a doctorate degree to legally practice. In those cases there is often no master at all to do even outside the US. That's the case in some -if not all - canadian provinces. In those fields, you can still do a master if you are not accepted in a PhD program the first time you apply to increase your chances of being admitted.

There are hundreds of ways to get removed from a program and most of them are based on the opinions of your performance from your PI and various other staff members. Legal or not you'd be locked out of your program for good long before you ever got to court if you wanted to get down that road. I wouldn't consider those options at all, you want to be on everyone's good side. I'm not sure where some of the replies are getting the idea of timesheets and all from. My employment here revolves around keeping my PI happy, that means I'm here all the time. No timesheets needed to justify putting me on probation whenever they want. The handbook lays out so many different ways to get booted from a program.\n\nNone of what I said is a bad thing if you're a dedicated student. It's just what you do and it's never inconvenienced me at all having that outlook. This might sound bleak but it's been fine to me so far. It's just more than a full-time job's worth of work.\n\nWorking a weekend or two is one thing, but you will want all of your time available. During my first year I had about three classes/semester and I always had a least one that was on average 30+ hours a week on homework alone. You add TA'ing and research into that and there's not much time left. I wouldn't personally want obligate the little time I had to sleep, working another job. I would suggest reading through your department's graduate handbook and getting a feel for just how often you will need very in-depth forms of progress reporting such as first year exams on top of classes, second year pre-orals, third year orals, etc...\n\nI cast my vote to the side of taking out small loans whenever frugal living fails you. Assuming you're in the US, it's criminal that they are paying you that much for a stipend. If it's not too late I might even consider looking at other programs. That to me sounds like a school without a graduate union, or one where the union is powerless. Might make your life that much harder.\n\nIf grants and fellowships are available your PI will know. If they aren't super helpful another PI that you meet over the course of classes probably will be. All of those will be considerable extra work though compared to anything you did in your undergrad (at least in my personal experience). I convinced my PI to RA me and got a noticeable pay raise, so that's also an option. If you're valuable to your PI they will make it work, all the more reason to be on campus that much more often.\n\nI like to leave as much weekend open as possible to try and drink away the issues of the week. I wouldn't want to spend that time serving other people the drinks I personally need, but to each their own.\n\nEDIT: Also I'm sure there is a dedicated new-grad coordinator who would have a pre-canned answer to almost all of your questions.

I suck at ochem and I hate it, but most of my chemist friends are in organic. I don't really have an answer to any of your questions, but I have some related experiences I think might help.\n\nMost of the environmental labs I've been in have been largely analytical in nature. Especially those leaning towards atmospheric or water chemistry. I wouldn't call my experience the whole story though. I will say that in my opinion though I haven't met any environmental chemists who are doing ochem though. I imagine that they probably exist somewhere, maybe in great numbers, but I have never met one.\n\nI have a classmate from my masters who got an RnD job in Maryland with his masters in organic. His first offer was about $130,000/year but he was very published for a masters student and waited about a year working at McDonalds before that paid off. All of my other acquaintances or friends who really excelled in ochem are either in a PhD program right now, are in med school right now, or are dropping out/dropped out of med school right now. Ochem is definitely one of the more broadly employable fields of chemistry though in my opinion. I was job searching in my area before I decided on a PhD, and all of my local chemist's positions were analytical or organic.\n\nI feel like green chemistry is more of an adjective that describes a focus of another field, rather than being a field itself. In that light I bet there are a lot more programs that might interest you, as they are green chem, just labeled as another focus. Environmental work is something that not only is awesome to be passionate about, but the money in the field also gets better as we progressively destroy our world. I would definitely recommend looking into an intership at a national energy lab if you're in the US. They tend to pay decent enough wages, and it's one of the few options a person can take if they want to work for a year and figure stuff out without making themselves look worse as a potential PhD student. Two of my cohort interned at a national lab for a year before coming here and both of them are confident that it helped a lot.\n\nI intend on going into industry or government work after I graduate and energy related work is certainly high on my list. The money is good, and the jobs are always there. The added benefit of maybe helping un-screw the planet is an awesome additional perk. I plan on trying to get into a national energy lab after this if I can work it, so definitely check those out. A lot of them have direct ties to specific programs, and if you do well in your internship you might have options available to you that no other students might have. The same logic applies to other opportunities I imagine, I am just unaware of them. I do have another in my cohort who is currently doing the program for his active military service, but I imagine that option isn't for many people.\n\nAll of that being said, a lot of people here will tell you that you don't always need a PhD. A lot of the energy jobs out there won't need it. My understanding of the situation is that you largely just need the degree of you're looking to manage your own research. If you're uncertain about what to do next just keep doing what you're doing here and talk to as many people as possible. Reach out to potential employers or schools and just ask questions about the things you care about. You'll get ignored a lot and you'll also probably receive a lot of enthusiastic answers from people who are stoked you reached out.\n\nI will say that I took a year off and I worked mundane lab job before I came to grad school. I would not suggest doing anything which isn't forward progress. I was told by staff members at my current university that when they are examining students, they are very aware of the fact that people atrophy information and skills very quickly when those skills aren't used every day. I had a large rejection to acceptance ratio and I imagine that has a lot to do with it. If you have time off for whatever reason, try to make sure you're doing stuff that looks good on your application to your schools or your \"real job\" in that time.\n\nAll of this is just my experience and my opinions though. I've only done this once so I wouldn't at all be surprised if a lot of what I said here was skewed, or just flat out incorrect. I will say that even though this program has already been one hell of a nightmare and it gets worse every day, I really like it. Doing your own research is really awesome, and I would cast a vote into any research related hat that you might have open.\n\nHope it helped in some way.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p1rfv4/green_chemistry_phd/h8gnny1/"}, "1224": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "schwatto", "Date": 1628632639, "Score": 3, "Body": "I did this.

Most of these apply to anyone, but are more important to consider/be aware of when you have lots of outside life going on in addition to your studies.\n\n- Know that it's absolutely okay for you to decline opportunities and projects at times. There are times when it just won't work to take on something new and that's okay. Decide early on what your goal/priority for projects not directly related to your studies will be, tell your partner or important others, and set a rule for yourself that you'll always give yourself a day or two before responding either way to potential opportunities. During those days, really assess how the project fits into your pre-established priorities, and if you think you're not being objective, run it by your important people first. And remember, your decline can simply be \"Thank you for the opportunity, but it doesn't fit with my goals at the moment.\"\n\n- Make sure that there's at least one person from the program assigned or tasked or otherwise obligated to check in with you at least quarterly. This may be your advisor or the program director or whomever as long as it is someone who is tasked with remembering you exist and matter.  Because I technically started as a part-time student and wasn't assigned to a faculty member as a GA, after coursework ended before I formed my candidacy committee, there was basically no one who had any investment in my progress or lack thereof. Which made it really easy to just kind of fall out of contact with the department for a while in between coursework and candidacy.   Sure, I could have emailed someone myself, but the transition from coursework to candidacy was rough without someone at least sending a friendly check-in email every month or two.  \n\n- Know that you're more likely to suffer from burnout than the average PhD student (and most of them get burned out at some point...).  It'll likely happen. Know your personal stress signs and find some ways that work for you to quickly manage it so you can fulfill your immediate responsibilities, and some ways that are more fulfilling and restorative longer-term for you that you can proactively plan.  \n\n- Relatedly, get to know the hard timelines and requirements. How many credits do you need to be enrolled per semester? How many semesters do you have to complete coursework? What about between coursework and candidacy? Dissertation proposal and defense? Full program length?  Then you can plan for mini (or longer) breaks if you need them or think you might.  In my program, for example, there's no limit on coursework or anything pre-candidacy, bit once you've passed candidacy, there's a 3 year limit, with two optional 1 year extensions. So if you need a break, it's better to do it pre-candidacy than post.\n\n-Whenever possible, find ways to leverage your work experiences to support or strengthen your academic work.  My job while PhDing initially was in an aligned field to my studies, but the work itself was not at all similar or aligned.  Constant brain switching between tasks is really, really hard and takes a lot.  My new job is less topically-related than my previous job (but still in a tangential area), but the work itself is research-oriented, so I'm reading, writing, analyzing data, submitting IRB applications, etc. on a daily basis.

I positioned my monitor by the window with a beautiful view outside. Two reasons for this. Firstly, it'll lessen the eye strain as your eyes can wonder to faraway scenery as well as your upclose work, and secondly it'll keep your body in a biorhythm (science ppl do correct me if I'm wrong here) - the light, the sounds of people going to work/school and coming back.\n\nIn terms of raw time though, I'd manage between 2-4 hours a day when there wasn't a hard deadline, and 6 when there was.

Also just a word of advice because I have been there;\n\nI was supposed to go to a top US school, but decided to apply to the UK (wasnt interesting to stay in canada for my field) instead because I thought that maybe with my qualifications I could skip the master for real and save on time (which isnt really possible in the US because lf how their PhDs are set up). This move saved me 3 years of my life and I still ended up in a top school for my field and my research is fully sponsored by the university and industrial partner. In the end, if you don't care about going into academia and want to get into the industry, what matters is what the research you are doing is about. It needs to be relevant for the industry. It's not the name of the university you go to or the country you do it in that matters. So I would encourage you to not be shy and apply to PhD programs in canada and in the EU/UK (fully funded ones of course).\n\nThe other thing you might want to consider is funding. Even if the university of your choice will cover your tuition and give you a stipend, any additional source of income is welcomed trust me. If you skip the master and do a PhD in canada, you will be eligible (assuming you field is eligible) to apply for NSERC *Master* funding for your first year of PhD study, which you are almost certain to get. The next year, you can apply to the PhD competition with a stronger application (because you will now have at least a publication and done some work on your thesis).\n\nHowever, if you do like me and go abroad instead, you can't do that. You will be thrown into the very competitive pool of PhD funding straight out of undergrad and will have to fight with very experienced people who have many publications. You also dont have any master thesis to describe in your application, which doesnt help you stand out at all. So It's near impossible to get funding for your first PhD year from the canadian gov if you go abroad and skip the master, unless you have multiple journal publications from your undergrad to compete with the other students.\n\nJust somethings to consider!

What is included and excluded. Will you look at non peer reviewed sources like news and blogs? Or only peer-reviewed articles? etc.\n3. Define search terms. Identify the literature databases you wish to search in.\n4. Run the search, with different permutations of your search terms. Track the number of articles found for each search. This will be a large table.\n5. Read each article's abstract and filter out the unsuitable articles.\n6. Decide when you have reached saturation (ie new articles are no longer providing new information) I typically use about 100 articles to produce a 3500 word lit review.\n7. Write the lit review.

I would like to give you my view on this:\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, I guess you seem to be experiencing cognitive dissonance ([Basic Infos from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)), meaning that your behavior/lifestyle and your thinking/values do not match. This gives us humans an uneasy feeling because our brain, as an \"organ of interpretation\", likes coherence. In this case, we try to reduce this dissonance through behavioral change or a new/different interpretation/way of thinking.\n\nYou say that being first to publish is more of an accomplishment than being second, i.e., you think very competitively. This leads me to motivational psychology. There is an empirically studied theory on this that postulates three main motives: power, achievement and affilaiton [(Again, Wiki Basics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_theory). Obviously, academia tends to be a cluster of \"power and achievement\" people. But lets use the publishing example again: someone who publishes first is not necessarily my enemy, as research is teamwork and meta-analyses are only possible if many research teams publish their research on a topic independently. This is an example of a more affilation-oriented mindset. Long story short: it might be worth looking at your motivation and act accordingy. If power is essential to you, do what it takes to move up in the hierarchy. If bonds are important to you, focus on teamwork and the contribution you make to society, regardless of whether others contribute more or less. Ultimately, the goal should be that your values/motivations are reflected in your actions.\n\nHere is my personal view on all of that: Humans are pack animals and society is a huge pack with a division of labor. Each human tries to play a role in the pack according to his abilities (cutting hair, planting food, providing medicine, etc.). We, the cluster of scientists, try to satisfy human curiosity and improve the quality of life. After all, knowledge gives us a sense of security and enables us to make efficient decisions. The problem from my point of view is that individualism makes us forget how dependent we all are on each other. The more specialized I am in one area, the less I know/can do in others. Hardly anyone cuts their own hair, does their own housework, does their own research, goes in search of food and water, does their own psychotherapy and makes their own medicines. We all depend on the expertise and actions of others. However, as pack animals, we also tend to have hierarchies (power, which has evolutionary biological advantages), and some people (especially in science) become more and more \"warriors\" as a result, who want to dominate others with 1000 papers and their intelligence, which can go as far as (sub)clinical narcissism. The whole thing can be very exhausting in the long run and here dissonance may come into play again. I think I have to stop now, otherwise the text will be too long, sorry!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p29zku/overworked/h8n4oah/"}, "1614": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "WikiSummarizerBot", "Date": 1628767620, "Score": 2, "Body": "**[Cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)** \n \n &gt;In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the perception of contradictory information. Relevant items of information include a person's actions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, and values, and things in the environment. Cognitive dissonance is typically experienced as psychological stress when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent.\n \n**[Need theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_theory)** \n \n &gt;Need theory, also known as Three needs theory, proposed by psychologist David McClelland, is a motivational model that attempts to explain how the needs for achievement, affiliation, power affect the actions of people from a managerial context. This model was developed in the 1960s, two decades after Maslow's hierarchy of needs was first proposed in the early 1940s. McClelland stated that we all have these three types of motivation regardless of age, sex, race, or culture. The type of motivation by which each individual is driven derives from their life experiences and the opinions of their culture.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PhD/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p29zku/overworked/h8n4pme/"}, "1615": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Aisha_low", "Date": 1628767923, "Score": 5, "Body": "Sounds silly, but I've found repositioning my desk to face a wall instead of the living room window has helped me stay slightly more focused.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p2pi35/i_have_somehow_lost_the_ability_to_apply/h8n560g/"}, "1616": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "hdorsettcase", "Date": 1628768212, "Score": 31, "Body": "I did everything right in the design, set up, and execution of my experiments...they just didn't work.

Which is easier said than done.\n\nTwo different things to consider: What *you* need and how to handle your boss.\n\nWhat *you* need is dependent on you. The PhD is often described as a marathon, not a 100 m dash, because of the length it takes to cross. So something as simple as giving yourself distinct days off and time off, or (on a daily basis) checking out after 8 hours of work (e.g. \"I will come in at 9 AM and leave by 5 PM, no exceptions) unless there's an actual crunch often helps. Trying not to think of your project after you leave work is a hard one, but seriously should be considered.\n\nHandling your boss on this is different. I'll say that most bosses seem to ignore the human tolerance part of things and just drive students, but I think the bigger reality is that many often don't keep track of your hours and only see if things are good to push for more. Which is bad management, but PhDs often make terrible managers.\n\nThen there's supervisors that guilt or force people to work harder. In that situation, I usually recommend more to say yes to your boss, then to just not listen to him and make sure you have enough face time and are dripping enough data for you to be left alone. It's always a great idea to have extra data you don't show your boss as a \"buffer\" for when times are slow.\n\nHonestly, the biggest metric of all is productivity. And if we're actually going to ignore the entire \"leaving an impression\" part of it, that's often calculated by (hard work * working smart). If you're not very smart, you need to compensate by working VERY hard. If you're working much more smartly (collaboration, trying things together, pinpointing precise experiments), then you can afford to not work as hard. The ideal is to ensure you are productive but then can live life.\n\nPhD is a path to a profession after all, not a religion or theology.

Financially, we are treated as second-class citizens, making it difficult to live a fulfilling life outside of our work.\n\n&gt;My mental health challenges went undiagnosed for 1.5 years into my PhD, &amp; I was an absolute WRECK.

You did the right thing by seeking help, and you managed to pull through despite having something so significant holding you back.

Try not to bring yourself down too much OP, we are our own biggest critics. From my experience, it is *completely* ordinary to lose interest in your research.

(Essentially, showing both the originality of your proposal, but also that it's driven by the scholarship)\n\nFor IR, your methodology will be important - how are you going to conduct your research, and why will this be the way to answer your research question - and likely also your theoretical framework too. For history, in most places, your primary sources will be more important - what sources you are planning on using (I've seen more than one proposal where applicants have talked about accessing national archives that don't even exist- so do some research!) and making sure they fit your research question (ie if you want to research public opinion on something, then don't just talk about what's available in Hansard). You don't have to know specifically *which* sources, but you need to show some awareness of the types of sources, where they are located, that you can access them etc\n\nIf you want an academic career, it's best to get at least some funding (fees, if not a stipend) to improve your future employability.  In addition to general, open competitions, you'll also see ads for PhD places connected to specific projects, where the supervisor has a large grant- in that case, you will likely see more specifics - \"topics related to quantitative study of ethnic conflict in SE Asia\" say- but you will still be expected to produce your own proposal that aligns with the brief.\n\nIf you'd be interested in the UK, go to jobs.ac.uk - you can search by discipline, and filter for PhD opportunities, and also set up alerts so you'll get an email when something new is posted. I see frequent (ish) ads also for PhD places in Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and Hungary, and occasionally China, Singapore and elsewhere.

However, I recommend that you try to find senior positions that these entry-level jobs could lead you to and see what are the requirements (not talking about corporate/management positions here). In R&amp;D, try to look for \"Senior Key Expert\" in the job title (might be called differently in your field). Maybe it would be better to try to find the statistics on the academic background of those who held such positions instead of job ads since it's a level that is often acheived by being internally promoted (so no job ads). All that to say, If a master and some years of experience are fine for some entry level postions, it doesnt mean it will be always the case once you start progressing in your career. Without a PhD for those jobs, at some point you are likely to hit a soft cap in career progression or pay.\n\nIf you want to go in the industry and the job that are interesting to you recommend that you have a PhD, I recommend doing an \"industrial PhD\" rather than the traditional academic one. Or alternatively go with a master and once/if you hit that soft cap, ask for the company to fund a PhD for you, but that's a gamble and will happen at an older age when you won't necessarily want to go back to \"school\".\n\nAn industrial Phd is when you have an industrial partner sponsoring and funding the research. They also provide industrial support by providing industrial supervisors and research guidance by getting their researchers involved. ( I am not talking about an academic based research with an industrial consortium providing funding, although  that wouldn't hurt either if you can't find a more direct type of industrial collaboration.)\n\nWith an \"industrial Phd\" the research is more directly relevant to the industry and you can get a foot in the door at the company behind the research. Even if you don't end up being hired by them, you will have gained a lot of experience working in an industrial research context and by interacting with industrial researchers, which will be very relevant for other job applications. You can also end up with a few letters of recommendations from industrial researchers, and even some from researchers very high up in the ranks of your R&amp;D field (\"Senior key experts\") since those are the ones usually involved hands on with any academic collaborations.\n\nRegarding the time of the PhD if that's what worries you, in the US they have the master part \"hidden' inside the PhD program and almost impossible to get removed, so the average time is 5-7 years compared to 3-4 years for most fields in STEM outside of the US. If time worries you, you might consider going abroad. For that, you would likely need to be good student with good references and internship experience to get international student funding. If you fit this profile, you can try to truly skip the few additional years of the US PhD programs and end up in a shorter PhD program abroad.\n\nThat's what I did, but I am not in your field (directly from the bachelor to a 3 year PhD program in aerospace in the EU/UK, I work in R&amp;D in Canada with my sponsor)\n\nedit: Many companies have research centres established at universities for the main purpose of funding industrial PhDs and recruiting future R&amp;D employees.

In some countries, like in the US, you often have to come up with a PhD proposal during your first year and then try to find a supervisor. But in many (if not most) other countries, you kind of apply to a PhD research proposal that is attached to a supervisor and is already set to be funded. So for (a ridiculously simple) example, if the research proposition you applied for is on how to improve the growth rate of bananas using fertilizers with a reduced amount of chemicals, you can't come in and decide to study the effect of sunlight exposition to their growth rate instead. But you can decide which techniques, methodology, software, sample size, fertilizer composition, etc you want to use for your research. Your supervisor will provide input and challenge your choices to make it more robust research. If they suggest something, you don't necessarily have to go through with it, but must be prepared to justify why you don't.\n\nIf your project is funded by an industrial partner (meaning, a company that collaborates with a University), it's either because\n\n1. They were approached by the university to collaborate as it is their field of R&amp;D and are interested in the results of your research so that they can compare/apply them to their own confidential findings/projects\n2. They approached the university with a research proposal because they are interested in using the lab/equipment that they have or need some extensive research conducted that is at the detailed level of academic research or want to validate their confidential findings through an independent research program\n\nThese companies are always interested in a specific aspect of your research (the results lol), so they often have a rough idea of what they would like you to test or use as a methodology so that they can use it for their own work. These details are imposed on your methodology through a legal agreement with the university before you were even aware this project existed. To take my bananas example again, they might impose the ambient conditions or the ph level of the fertilizer as this is the only thing they are interested in (= why they are funding the project). This doesn't mean that you can't test a higher ph level than what they are asking for or use another type of fertilizer. It simply means that whatever you chose to do, you at least need to fulfil the agreement they have with the university.\n\nSo with an industrial partner or any external funding body, you still have freedom, but a little less. Usually, you will often have meetings with the partners funding you to share the progress of your research and get their input.\n\n&gt;I might be wrong, but do only professors/staff scientists get to decide what kind of ideas to pursue (based on funding too)? An industry researcher won't?\n\nIndustrial research is *very* different from academic research. If a project gets funded in the industry, it's for a financial reason (they want to make money) and it will result in a product, so the funding is there. The research is fast. They ain't got no time to lose on academic details. You are also working in a team that works with other teams, you are not the decision-maker unless you are a team leader/manager and there are multiple teams that collaborate together and must agree together on what is going to change because it could affect other parts of the system/whatever others are working on.  If there's no financial gain from a research idea or if it's not done to comply with a gov regulation, then it likely won't be financed by the company.\n\nProfessors have a lot of freedom in choosing their research because they do not have to commercialize the end product. However, that leaves them running after funding, so they need to prove their research is valuable and novel which is often done by getting recognition through publications, etc... I could go on and on to explain in great details but I suggest you make a post of your own and get more opinions on it. It would be interesting. Let me know if you do\n\n&gt;Is viewing the PhD as training is the correct way to think about it?\n\nSo, where I come from, the master trains you to be a researcher, not the PhD. You are very alone during your PhD and you make decisions yourself. Nobody trains or tells you what to do if that makes sense. In the US, the master is hidden inside of a PhD program, so I can't really say. So depending on who you ask, yes and no. Again, it would be interesting if you write a post about it.

In research, no matter how confident you are, THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY YOU ARE WRONG. \n\n2) come at this from an angle of assistance, not adversarially. Again, your group mates should be your closest allies, not your enemies. Offer to help fix the flaws, if it's fixable, or offer alternatives. Help improve the project.\n\n3) find another group. If your colleagues and your supervisor are truly dedicated to doing bad science, get out. You don't want to be there.

My advice would be to do some digging into research groups and potential supervisors that align with your research interests. Remember you'll be working on your PhD for the next 4 years, so it's important that you're interested in the topic you chose if you're going to stay motivated throughout. Also be sure to get a feel for how invested any potential supervisors are in their students - you want a supervisor to act as a mentor to you, not someone who simply sees their students as data monkeys. Do be absolutely certain that the PhD route is right for you, a PhD is a long slog and can be a struggle for even the most highly motivated student. There are plenty of career paths in psychology and elsewhere that don't require a PhD, so do consider these too.

The last six months I was so exhausted I couldn't stop crying and had to keep on reminding myself *this is what you wanted!* I am in a similar place mentally / emotionally now that I have a job in my field.\n\nSome advice from my experience! Pay very close attention to your diet, make sure you're getting enough protein and enough \"brain\" food like omega-3s from salmon and walnuts. Increase healthy calories. This made a world of difference in my energy, attentiveness, and emotional stability. Do not fill up on junk or your brain will start putting out junk.\n\nSleep is obvs important even tho I don't do it enough I've always known I should. What made a huge difference to me was mandatory exercise for an hour every day. If I workout once a day regularly then my energy levels increase. If I stop working out I eventually stop getting out of bed.\n\nGood luck internet friend! You are trying to do a really cool thing that is really challenging. It will be so worth it!

I just finished undergrad a few months ago, and I'm starting my PhD program in a month (for context). That being said, having just gone thru the application process, here's my 2 cents.\n\n1. Figure out which area of psychology you're interested in. One cool thing about psychology is that is has so many subareas, which can also be challenging. Try to find a few areas you're interested in, and find PhD programs in those areas, with faculty who conduct research that aligns similarly with your interests. For example, being interested in Social Psychology - doctoral program in Social Psych.\n\n2. Figure out your research interests. Of the research you've participated in, were there any topics you found really interesting or that you're passionate about? Who are researchers in the field doing the work you're into? Try searching the References section of papers you found interesting. \n\n3. See if the department you're interested in, will have an open house or something similar. This can be a great way to learn more about the department and the faculty members, without as much pressure of an interview.\n\nApplication Cycle\n1. Create a list of programs you're interested in applying to - make sure to take note of the requirements for each application. Do they want a CV, GRE scores (general test or psychology subject test), a written sample, how many letters of recommendation, when are the deadlines, will yhsy do interviews, will they host an open house for interested applicants?\n\n2. Create a list of your recommenders. These need to be faculty who can speak to your research capabilities. I personally had 1 PI, 1 course instructor, and 1 faculty mentor for my applications, to paint a better picture of my qualities.\n\n3. Prepare statements - statement of purpose, research statement, career statement, and personal statement are all different things lol. Learn which ones you'll be asked to submit. And try to have a faculty member or graduate student help look those over and offer feedback.\n\n4. Faculty mentor - in psychology, most faculty members run a lab, unless they're recently hired. That being said, try to  figure out which faculty members that you're interested in, will be able to accept students in their lab this upcoming cycle. I definitely cried a few nights after finding a cool faculty member, whose research aligns with my interests, only to learn that they aren't accepting students (hurts more if that was the only faculty member you're interested in). Try to have more than one, per program, that you're interested in working with. I personally, think it's fine to cold email a faculty member because that's what I did most times. If that's what you end up doing, try to include your full name, degree, and research interests in the email, as well as why you think their interests fit yours. And ask if they are accepting students this cycle. Some give a simple yes or no. Some, if they're more available, may invite you to a phonecall or zoom meeting to discuss their research and you being an applicant further. Some faculty members may not do this, per their institutions policies. So...yeah.\n\n5. GRE - if you need it for applications, and you haven't taken it already, make sure you give yourself enough time to take it, and get the scores back before applications are due. \n\n\nI know this was a lot but hopefully some of it is helpful.

However, you must think of several aspects before committing to research.

This is simply a suggestion, but this experience will help you cope much better in projects and work under pressure.

Ask your supervisor who the module lead is for the course (they should know because the module lead has already asked them!), then send an email asking for a sample lecture, either from last year on the same topic, or a similar topic so you can see the depth and complexity of the lectures so you hit the right level.\n\nAs for conferences vs lectures, I'm fairly certain that you'll walk out the lecture preferring lecturing.

Balance, knowing to cut yourself off on things and have measured activity, is important.

Normal work day is 8 hours, and I would plan things accordingly.\n- Know *your* expectations before what your mentor expects. If you've hit results that you need for the paper you want, and it's reasonable in quality, then it's worth pursuing. \n- Maybe harder to do, but encourage communication with your mentor.

So it comes down to going higher if the abuse is getting worse and you're not getting the help you need. But I understand about not wanting to pull that trigger.\n\nI'll be honest, the reason to make sure you have some help isn't to actually get the help directly (professors don't want to step on toes), but it's to help you form an exit strategy and leverage. Do you have enough to graduate? Do you have support from your committee and program to finish? Will you be finishing up? If these are yes, you can force an issue of applying for jobs if you're already on your way, and force your PI to follow suit.\n\nIs he a new PI or an older PI? If he's new, may be desperate for data and trying to get tenure. So one thing to note, PIs often make terrible managers. To go one step further, PIs are often terrible at managing projects. If they're from larger labs originally and are just starting, they often have had untold amount of resources that are not available when they start their own labs. If they're older, they've been so far out of the actual experiment phase that they are just daft to what's going on. Either way, they also typically make terrible mentors and teachers, do not dictate experiments and time tables well. \n\nI've often heard the words \"lack of productivity,\" or \"not being in lab enough,\" or \"efficiency\" before. Frankly, it's usually geared towards the wrong people and I think it's complete goddamn bullshit. Your PI should be helping you plan and setting time accordingly, setting time tables. You know, things that they do in any other fucking industry. You should be communicating results (good and bad) to your PI, and your PI should be, in turn, helping you dictate the next experiments that can be done and negotiating time frames with you.\n\nThe problem is that PIs often call \"good\" results productive and \"bad\" results unproductive. That's idiocy. If the \"bad\" results are due to your inexperience or inability, then it's something that should be addressed without recourse. If the \"bad\" results are due to bad planning, that's on your fucking PI. Delays happen (COVID especially fucks a lot of things up) and in that sense it's your PIs responsibility to be helping you navigate and change plans. Flexibility is key, but should have reasonable help.\n\nMy philosophy is that after a certain amount of time, more work doesn't equate to more productivity. Anything over 40 hours typically is diminishing returns, and anything over 50-60 hours typically has negative returns (e.g. it hurts you more than helps). You're not working in a damn factory and counting cogs. Research is a creative venture, and work is done as it needs to be done. There's a time and need to work harder, but it shouldn't be driven to ridiculous lengths. \n\nPart of this is recognizing your independence on the situation. You, not your PI, should dictate when you come in and how you do your work, especially if your PI is not being altogether helpful on this. It's one thing if you don't show up daily or show up 20 or 30 hours a week and get nothing done (I've seen that happen). But again, put in the requisite hours (do 9 - 5 or 8:30 - 4:30), perform the experiments you need, and give yourself a break. If your PI bitches, negotiate the times and position accordingly. If he says shit about productivity or whatnot, explain insults aren't helpful and that you'd appreciate some actual tutelage and training. \n\nOr nod your head yes and just ignore him.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p8he4m/advice_needed_very_frustrating_and_demanding/h9shpj0/"}, "2972": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Big_Faithlessness625", "Date": 1629556740, "Score": 1, "Body": "It's really starting to sound like working out now haha thanks", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p57vjr/lit_review_software/h9skg3s/"}, "2973": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "badabadabadaba", "Date": 1629556922, "Score": 2, "Body": "I also immigrated for study, originally from nz and I'm not sure how long it'll be before I can see my family again with the border quarantine system (super expensive and really hard to get a spot). it really does make things so much worse when you're completely isolated from your support system :/ \n\nForest is a really good idea, I used it a lot in my first year and it was really good when I was doing my lit review, will give that another shot :) I ended up telling my supervisors in my email yesterday, haven't got a reply yet but im feeling better for getting it out there fwiw. hope things pick up for you \ud83e\udd17", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p7cgpz/should_i_tell_my_supervisors_my_mental_health_is/h9sku5w/"}, "2974": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "HyperbolicInvective", "Date": 1629562751, "Score": 1, "Body": "Can I ask how much you were funded?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p7qi8v/i_quit/h9sxl1i/"}, "2975": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Trillbotanist", "Date": 1629563675, "Score": 6, "Body": "At many non USA universities you cannot get into a PhD program if you don\u2019t have an MS- like it\u2019s just a prerequisite.\n\nOtherwise probably not- at least from where I am (R1) theres only one or maybe two cases where you get nothing.

Even if your topic is different, try to emulate and logically organize like they do. \n* think deep on ways to meet them in the middle in terms of the topic. \n* before proposing an idea do a literature review (e.g. see connectedpapers.com) and make sure your idea represents a new gap,  theoretically or applied, in the field.

That sounds like interesting stuff.  My wife is an architect and I watched her go through some of what you describe when she was in school.\n\nIt sounds like you are thinking about topics that might be considered Industrial Design Education. That may be where your advisor is getting hung up. Some people do not consider research on the pedagogy of a subject to be research in that subject area. I personally consider it entirely valid, and inter-disciplinary in that it potentially involves many related areas. It might help to get a co-advisor in Education or even a related area of neuroscience or something.\n\nIn any case, my recommendation to you would be to broadly sketch out the space of your thesis and then focus on one specific question or a narrow set of questions that you can address in the time available. The goal shouldn't be to do \\*everything\\*, but to do \\*something\\*, and to do it very well.\n\nHere's an example of a question you might address (keeping in mind that I have \\*no\\* idea if it is a good question, just that it is potentially of appropriate scope): Do students ultimately design better if their initial focus is on understanding design or on technical skill or both? I know in Architecture school, my wife was taught both in parallel. Is that optimal?\n\nThis question is interesting in part because it comes up in every field of endeavor. Do you teach the art or the technical skill first? Focus on fundamentals or breadth of understanding? Teach them in parallel or start with one of them?\n\nI saw this in the Olympics, for example. The Chinese divers almost always dominate, and one of the announcers mentioned that they have a huge focus on technical skill, beginning with six months of training just on how to enter the water properly. The Chinese government also recruits and begins training Olympic athletes very young, which obviously contributes to their success, but their technical proficiency is undeniable, their entries are outstanding, and that precision obviously contributes to their overall success.\n\nAnother question might be (testing your assumption): Can we significantly improve students' ability to see, perceive space and understand forms--all skills important for industrial design--via targeted exercises focused on perception, muscle memory, eyes tracking, dexterity, and representation techniques (i.e., are these skills innate or can they be developed)? If they can be developed, how are they best developed.? Which students does it help the most, and how? Does it help those who would otherwise be unable to succeed?

It was something I was able to take during my second year as a grad student with the intention of helping to frame a fellowship/grant/proposal. It forces you to think about your project, to discuss with your mentor the directions and aims, and to be able to frame it in an accurate manner. If your program offers this (and of course if it has decent reviews) TAKE ADVANTAGE.\n- A sort of extension on the previous advice, reuse and repurpose writing whenever possible. Your proposal can be reused as multiple grants or fellowships. The sections can be reused for your papers or dissertation. Always think of ways where your writing can be used for something more than just that goal in mind.\n- Learn to write an abstract as fast as possible. It's almost always framed as (1) Background, (2) Problem, (3) Methods used, (4) Results, (5) Conclusion. Each section should be one sentence, two to three maximum (for Results). The faster you can do this, the easier life becomes.\n- Writing papers and publications should be encouraged. It helps build your dissertation. If you're able to write a review, take advantage of this opportunity as it can be used as your background or introduction section of your dissertation.\n\nRegarding PhD experience:\n\n- I think the number one problem is typically people having terrible mentors. Pick a mentor based on kindness, attention to students, and funding. The first two I would say is more important than the third, and the third would be less a problem if the first two are actually adhered towards (a good mentor will not take a student if they are missing funding).\n- The second biggest problem is time management leading to burn-out. Students should work hard, but it needs to be in moderation. I usually worked 6 days a week, but took plenty of breaks in the middle, had long lunches, or went to a movie or something. If things were getting tiring, I took days off or took some weeks easier. Learn to moderate and shift time accordingly.\n- Take your time to explore options. This is particularly true for your third and fourth year. You may not want to do a postdoc, which is excellent. But you need to start searching for what you want your future to get towards with the training that you have obtained. That sometimes means getting more training in other areas, and in that case it should be explored and time should be negotiated accordingly.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/p9jxj9/write_write_write_but_how/h9ybu07/"}, "3192": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dogsandnumbers", "Date": 1629666100, "Score": 4, "Body": "So I was in a sorta similar situation.

The PI's are the successful minority, who in my opinion, can be quite deluded - hence, they believe that all their students can become a PI too and if they don't, it's due to their lack of aptitude, rather than a lack of jobs/toxic environment/bad luck.\nThe attitude of the PI's helps to drive the toxic cycle of too many graduates and too few jobs. The competition for jobs drives the overworking/competition. If anyone says that they don't want to stick with academia, the toxic environment takes over and this person is criticised as they're seen as a 'failure'. Furthermore, PI's rely on their students success - it looks good on a PI's resume if their past students publish well and begin their own labs. This also opens the door for more collaborations too.\nPI's also see PhD students as an investment of time and money. Due to the competition for PhD places too, they probably will be disappointed if their chosen candidate wants to leave academia, as they probably believe they could have chosen a candidate who would like to stay.\n\nEssentially, the pressure to stay in academia stems from the top. PI's rely on this pressure to maintain an active pool of potential employees who will devote their life to science, due to the fierce competition for jobs/grants. In doing so, their students will improve the PI's resume with publications and connections. If anyone breaks this cycle, it does not benefit the PI, so they're looked down on. Some postdocs add to this toxic mentality, as many are trapped in a cycle of accepting positions that go nowhere and never manage to secure fellowships to process to PI level.

That happens.\n\nWhether you further pursue or do something else is your own choice.\n\n---\n\nAs an aside, I don't know why so many people are picking mentors that know nothing about the work they're doing. \n\nDO NOT DO THIS.\n\nYou should not be picking an advisor that has no damn clue what you're doing and can't help you, or you should be changing research topics that more fit their expertise so that you can learn to handle a project of that type independently. \n\nYou don't go to a biology lab thinking of doing a damn engineering project as a PhD project. Unless your PI is invested in learning and has the toolset to teach you how to learn new fields, you should not sway too far from what they know. So for instance, if your mentor is an expert in cancer biology but wants to learn neuroscience, it CAN work out if your main tools are going to be cancer biology related and where you need to branch. But if it's so reliant on other people that your mentor cannot help or needs the collaboration of another, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT PURSUE THAT PROJECT.\n\nThis makes more sense if you're a postdoc that is expanding on an idea and have more of an idea how to implement those aspects, but not as a PhD project.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/palcvt/have_got_4_months_to_complete_a_phd_dissertation/ha655bo/"}, "3568": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "reginleif91", "Date": 1629818110, "Score": 2, "Body": "I use latex and love using overleaf for that.

I wish I could have figured out how to manage myself better during grad school. I had an awesome time! And a very stressful time. Every step you take towards your PhD, then getting a post-doc or job, and then going up for tenure and promotion seem so hard, and then once you make that achievement there is another one in front of you to stress you out. Remember when writing a 10-page paper in high school seemed impossible, but then in college it was easy peasy? Remember how impossible it was to produce a masters thesis, but now you can crank out a similar 300+ page report or whatever in a couple weeks? These achievements keep challenging you, and can make your life miserable depending on your ability to handle them. On top of all this you have relationships, marriage, kids, divorce, health crises, and other major life events. It all can get overwhelming. Life is hard. In my opinion you need to figure out yourself and your goals and values as soon as possible and take charge of your life. Look deep inside and figure out if having a PhD is something that truly matters to you. For some reason it made it possible for me to feel good about myself. I wish I did a lot of things differently though. I wish I had better work-life balance. My husband and I were both academics and worked so much. 15 years later we were divorced. We didn\u2019t make time for each other. And I have some health problems that I believe are due to stress and anxiety. I didn\u2019t know how to live and function in a healthy way.\n\nI am finally happy pretty much all the time because I figured out how to not give a f*ck about 95% of the things that used to bother me. Check out the book \u201cThe life changing art of not giving a f*ck.\u201d It changed my life. I\u2019m 43 now and life is awesome. My only complaint is that I don\u2019t make more money. I make enough to have everything I need and live a comfortable life though, so it isn\u2019t a big deal. I have my retirement planned out and should be fine long term. I am in a healthy, functional relationship, have awesome kids, love where I live, and spend plenty if time doing my hobbies. And I have summers off! I make my own schedule for the most part. I teach my classes and do research to satisfy my job requirement, but not more. I don\u2019t want to be a superstar at the expense of relationships and personal health.\n\nWould I be happy without a PhD? I have no idea.

The hard part is figuring that out.\n\nThere seems to be a surplus of PhDs out there now, and academic jobs are hard to get and pay is low. That alone might be good enough reason to not get a PhD.

Currently, I am writing in Typora which allows me to really focus and not be distracted by nice formatting or arrangements or databases or nice notion pages. Tasks end up at the bottom of the document or on a sheet of paper.

I rarely trust my summaries because as I move forward I learn more and more and see that my summaries were imprecise or lacking important information. However, I tried to use obsidian with its linking system and multiple windows to summarize topics and papers but I hate that I cannot see equations and graphs as I write in one page. Notion also does not so the trick really because I get lost in making nice structures instead of understanding the topic....\n\n- A gamechanger to quickly check for information was using the Alfred app on mac with the Zotfile renaming of Zotero. Just hitting the spacebar, entering citation key (filename) and boom I have the abstract, graphs and exact wording in front of me.\n\n- For review it has to be easy to use for everyone. Google docs was recommended by my supervisor but overleaf also works yet being less appealing for reading. \n\n- For handing in nice looking documents, latex is a no-brainer imo.

I couldn't afford to just work 50 % at a university and do my PhD at a university due to the fact that I am supporting my family with my salary.\n\nSo what I do now is work full time (40 hours a week) in a Vessel Traffic Service Centre. We are monitoring the ships in the German Bight and German waters. Anyway, this job can be pretty stressful. I am doing shift work as well. Day and night shift usually... Working weekends and holidays.\n\nI am enrolled as a PhD student at the technical university of Berlin (TU Berlin) as an external PhD student, which means I do not get any funding from the university regarding my research.\n\nSo what I can tell you from my experience, it is possible to work full time and do your PhD kind of part-time. I usually work between 10-20 hours a week on my research per week... It is very difficult and expect that you will struggle a lot. Your missing out a lot (going out with friends and family, celebrating birthdays or holidays etc). And it can be pretty expensive, too if you do not have funding for publications or conferences. \n\nMake sure that your new employer is supportive about your part-time research. Sometimes you need to get a day off because of a conference you're attending or a presentation you need to do... It helps a lot if your employer knows about your research and is supportive.\n\nI hope my answer helps you. If you have any more questions please ask me...\n\nGood luck and all the best for you!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pak3a7/law_phd_part_time_full_time_work_uk_feasible/ha9fqra/"}, "3789": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "pleasantfog", "Date": 1629872067, "Score": 39, "Body": "I was irate.

I have about 200 papers on it at the moment, and only used \\~1GB (out of 8GB), so there's no worry about running out of space. There's a number of page templates too, e.g. squared paper, lined, lined with margin, storyboard, checklist etc, so you can use it in many different ways.  \nThe e-reader element is pretty good, though the screen is a little smaller than A4, so text size is marginally smaller than a printed paper. It does have a zoom function though. You can annotate or highlight text (and erase what you write) and the reaction time from moving your hand to making the mark is barely noticeable, so it's just like writing with a pen.   \nThere's a mobile/desktop app that goes with it so you can add documents over wifi, or you can use the charging cable that comes with it. The stylus nib has to be replaced every so often, depending on how much you use it. It's a little expensive (\\~\u00a3400), but worthwhile if you can afford it.

I would watch a music video on YouTube of a song that inspired me (I switched between two songs) and on some days I watched both.

After finishing a paragraph, I was allowed to play one game of solitaire on the computer. You need the discipline to stop yourself from playing more, but it was nice to know that I could play another round after the next paragraph.\n\nI set goals for myself of what I wanted to accomplish.

As far as I can see it all boils down to what the individual professor thinks of you. I know my professor has fussed a bit over grades in the past, especially if the student has a low grade in our particular field (much more chemistry oriented) but mostly they will look at research experience and your letters of reference. If you absolutely want to come to the MPI getting research experience is a must. If your grades suck, but your referals about your research are great, then you probably will be fine. The recruitment program here looks mostly at how your previous research aligns with your intended research. Also, I would say of the foreginers at my insitute, people from India probably make up about a quarter, so your nationality is 100% not an issue.\n\nIf there is a specific research group you are interested in joining, and they don't have an advertised position, you can also email the research head.\n\nOne big heads up though: unfortunately, the MPI has had some high profile cases of harassment and bullying (google max planck bullying or Mobbing oder Bel\u00e4stigung). I personally know non-EU students whose residency permits were threatened by their department head because he is a bully. This is how he got them to work insanely long hours. He also refused to hire Germans because he knew that Germans stick up for their labour rights. Although I see the MPI slowly changing, certain contracts will never be overturned because getting tenure in the 90's meant you were there for life, regardless of their wrongdoings. So my advice is that if you contact someone directly, PLEASE make sure to speak to people in their department or lab before you accept anything.\n\nIf you like plant science, and are not 100% set on the MPI or Germany, Wageningen in the Netherlands, University of Vienna, ETH in Zurich, and the John Innes Centre in the UK and the VIB in Ghent, are all places I would highly recommend, both from personal experience and looking at where my colleagues got their research experience and degrees from. All of these places operate using English as their language. Do make sure to check if you are eligible for certain programs. In my experience it can be hard finding programs that take in non-EU people. But not impossible! And always feel free to email certain group leaders directly, if you are interested in their work. Sometimes they can arrange alternative sources of funding.\n\nIf you want more info, feel free to DM me.

I know 1-2 students who had to go work part-time in a normal student job like in restaurants and shopping centers because they couldn't find the above alternative and were really in need of additional funding as they were not only international students but also parents.  (I am in STEM for reference) \n\nWorking full-time while doing a PhD is near impossible as your PhD is already a like a full time job (regardless of legal status of PhD studentship in your countey). If you need to work full-time to support yourself, the school will often ask that you switch to a part-time PhD (taking twice the time!). If you have a free semester or one where you expect the workload to be smaller, you can try to arrange with your supervisor to go part-time in your PhD so you can take a full-time temporary position somewhere. In that kind of situation, you might need to get an extension at the end of your PhD if the program was meant to be continuous (no free summers like in some countries).  \n\nHowever,  some universities will try to restrict students from having additional sources of income when they are being funded. For example, some universities  have a policy saying that if you work or get another scholarship, the amount will be deducted from your university scholarship (so they reduce the amount they give you so that your total income remains the same). \n\nWhen you say you need more money due to your international status, is it because the university matches only the home student tuition+stipend and from the total sum you have to pay your international student tuition, so you are left with a smaller stipend (compared to home students)? If so, maybe you don't have to worry about any restrictions on income. The restrictions I mentioned above are usually true for home students that are fully-funded, but often they don't apply in such a scenario or will only allow you to gain enough to match the stipend of a home student.

A strong research proposal, which is easier to write if you've been working on your project for a little while. \n2. GREAT recommendations (not positive-but-underwhelming ones).

There will also probably be some administrative things to do, like setup your TU Delft account, arrange your campus card so you can get into the office, make sure you've got all the necessary software running (e.g. things like Slack or Teams if that's what your team works with) etc. \n\nIt will also depend on the project you're working on, and whether you're joining a project that's already in progress, or starting on something completely new. But regardless, you will probably have an intro meeting with your supervisors on day 1, and you can just openly ask them what they would like you to start with. PhD programs here are very much focused on independently working on your own project, something which I think has been even more the case now during COVID. But your supervisors are there to guide you, and help you, so don't worry about it too much, they'll give you an idea of what they expect once you start.\n\nI would say, PhD programs here in the Netherlands are setup very differently than programs in the US, which is where a large portion of the people on this sub come from. So keep that in mind when you read about what to expect from people who are doing their PhDs over there!\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pcpqoh/how_does_the_first_week_of_phd_look_like/hal1k4h/"}, "4325": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SamuraiBrz", "Date": 1630087755, "Score": 11, "Body": "I don't think it's worth doing a PhD in that case. A PhD would not be an escape from normal life, it would be more like leaving your normal life behind. It's a huge commitment. \n\nThere were periods when I worked more than 15 hours a day, for example. And you never know what's gonna happen, when things will go wrong, when a professor will ask you to do something suddenly. You can see how many people burn out during a PhD, or develop stress and anxiety. And we are talking about people who are usually very accomplished, brilliant people. Doing that while keeping a job would be insane in my opinion. \n\nI understand you want to do a PhD, but it would require you to make a sacrifice that doesn't make sense in your case. \n\nAnd people often get disappointed with the \"school and learning\" of a PhD program. Because it's typically so narrow that it doesn't even feel like learning. Research is a very different type of learning. When you study the same specific topic for years, and years, and years. For example, 4 years of my PhD are researching the exact same dataset. One dataset for 4 years.

A PhD consumes your time (4-7 years of your life!) and money, it means a lot of financial and social sacrifices, even personal sacrifices such as putting having a family on hold or buying a house.

Going into a PhD without knowing which career you want means you take the risk of not even liking the field you are getting specialized in, and having to start over your whole research. Considering what a PhD involves, that's a whole lot to be risking. This would involve having to switch labs, find a new supervisor and new thesis, sometimes even a new uni, which is a whole challenge itself. It happens, but switching thesis at the PhD level is not a decision that should be taken lightly. Also, every changes you make can often impact your funding. \n\nAnd might I point out, OP already has a master, so there's no point of going into a PhD with the reassurance that you can master out of the program if you end up not liking it.

Indeed, I was no where near them :D but I never realised that it is because I just started and it is perfectly ok to not know something. My technical skills were near to zero. I would avoid interacting with others because I was afraid that they will find out about my level of knowledge on the subject and other technical skills and they will think that I'm not smart!

It took 3-4 years for me to feel confident in interacting with others and making arguments. All the hard work paid off finally.\n\nI would say that keep working hard if you feel like you have to catch up, but stop thinking that you are an average.

There\u2019s a couple things metrics you can look at (although IMO each is flawed in its own special way):\n\n- a journals impact factor (IF): this is the go to measure for how \u201cimpactful\u201d a journal is. Essentially, it\u2019s a measure for how many times the average article gets cited after it\u2019s been published in the journal (unsure if there\u2019s a time period). This ranges WILDLY from field to field but generally an impact factor of 2 is at least OK.\n\n- the citations of an article are the article itself\u2019s main measure of impact. Ostensibly, it\u2019s a measure of how many other scientists/researchers are talking and using your work. There\u2019s issues with this too, but it\u2019s a standard measure across fields\n\n- a good article is also typically indexed well, meaning it\u2019s put into a lot of databases so people can find it. Usually, the big publishers have good indexing. We\u2019re talking Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, Sage Journals, Springer Nature. More recent open access based families like PLoS one, BMC, and Frontiers are pretty good too.\n\n- impact can also be measured through an Altmetric score, which is kind of like how many people have used the article in some way (eg posted on Twitter or FB, put into their mendeley, media posting, etc). Not as important for other researchers or universities but still kind of cool. \n\nThere\u2019s many more but that should be sufficient for what you need for your application.

I will also throw in the fact that it has led to extremely lucrative offers and I feel confident that it will help me move up the leadership ladder quickly. While I'm not sure I would encourage you to get a PhD in HR specifically (you may be better off with an HR-focused MBA), there are tremendous opportunities for any social science PhD to work in corporate social research (i/o psych and corporate sociology are huge), employee listening, learning &amp; development, diversity &amp; inclusion, analytics, as well as all of the fields that are now growing around remote work.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you may have about how the PhD translates to corporate HR.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pdtq6l/im_thinking_about_a_selffunded_phd_in_germany/hav8n6g/"}, "4738": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "DisastrousAnalysis5", "Date": 1630282320, "Score": 3, "Body": "All grad courses make me poop my pants, especially those outside my department.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pe2qe9/one_of_my_classes_this_upcoming_semester_makes_me/hav9vb4/"}, "4739": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Fragore", "Date": 1630282443, "Score": 5, "Body": "Made the best paper of my PhD out of spite of my ex breaking up with me.

Like, why would they go out of their way to say \"I'm not going to call you doctor\" if you don't even bring this up at all?\n\nMy general personal rule is that you're title really matters when things are in context. You don't call an MD \"doctor\" when they're fucking on the golf course unless there's a medical emergency on hand or if you're trying to chide them on a bad shot. \n\nLikewise, I only get called doctor on a professional capacity in meetings to establish a level of expertise and expectation. If someone calls me it in public, I usually tell them to just call me by my name.\n\nAnd even at a professional capacity, undergrads and high school kids only called me by my first name. Some didn't know that a postdoc had a PhD already and were wondering why I dressed like a homeless man all the time when they found out.\n\nBut if it's something stupidly out-of-place, my usual retort to this is, \"I never said anything about you calling me doctor,\" or \"And why is this an issue?\" or \"I mean, I reserve that for people that I can actually talk shop about my project with, and you're too fucking dumb to converse with.\"\n\nIf you want to go further, for your male friends, I'd simply ask about their inferiority complex.

You are the best to answer that question, so I am not sure if my perspective should really matter. However, I noticed that you seem to focus on the short term consequences of quitting your PhD. So I think these could be some good questions to ask yourself:\n\n1.How truly similar is the role? Would you have the same progression opportunity/Do you expect your decision to prevent you from progressing in your career at some point later in your life?  \n\nSome positions that would usually require a PhD but accept those who do not have one can have a soft progression cap. For example, in my field, you wouldn't be able to achieve the position with the title '' Senior Key Expert'' without a PhD. So while it's true that you might be receiving the same salary with and without a PhD for an entry-level position, down the road you might feel the financial impact of your choice if you can't progress to more senior specialized roles that usually require a PhD.   \n\n2.Do you think you would have gotten the position without your PhD experience? \n\nIf not, then it might indicate that you could face a soft progression cap somewhere in your career. Just something to think about and that only you can really answer since we do not have many details about your position/career goals. It's great to evaluate the impact on your near future, but you should also ask yourself questions about the long term impact of your decision.\n\n3.What does your future employer think about you not finishing your PhD? Are they expecting you to complete it so you can have a normal ''PhD'' progression within the company?\n\n Sometimes graduation is conditional to a job offer. I mean, if you applied with a resume showing you are currently a PhD student, I would be surprised if they are not aware you would have to quit your studies or finish them before joining full time. Have you discussed this with them?\n\n&gt;I have no desire to pursue academia after the PhD. \n\nYou can do research outside of academia in industrial R&amp;D. PhDs can be required for R&amp;D positions and some companies expect their researcher to publish and attend conferences. Is this what you would be doing? If so, in a few years when you try to change jobs, do you think not having a PhD would impact your chances of getting senior positions at other companies? (Again linked to the possibility of a progression cap)\n\n4.Would it be easy for you to have an offer for a similar role after you graduate? What is the placement rate of PhD students at your department? If it wouldn't be an issue and considering you have 1 year left, personally I would finish the PhD. I would also be afraid of having to explain to a future company a 3-year employment gap on my resume (assuming you can't master out), but that's just me. You have to think if that kind of thing can affect you in the future and if you want to bother about it or not. \n\nThese are questions that only you can answer and you don't have to provide an answer here. It's for your internal debate about your situation.

You can be seen as overqualified for some positions that don't require a PhD if you have a PhD.\n\nI remember I interviewed a PhD candidate for a mechanical engineering design position in aerospace R&amp;D once. When I gave my feedback to the person who would have been their supervisor, I ended by saying they had a PhD and the supervisor cut me off and said '' no never mind they are overqualified'' and disregarded the other qualifications of the person. It's sad and shouldn't happen in my opinion, but unfortunately, it does.\n\nThere are 3 reasons for doing a PhD:\n\n1. You want to go into academia\n2. You want to go into industrial R&amp;D and the positions you desire require a PhD\n3. The positions you want require a PhD even if it's not in R&amp;D\n\nIf you don't fit in any of the reasons above, then how can you justify doing a PhD? Don't do a PhD for the sake of doing one. A PhD is not fun, it involves a lot of sacrifices. Your financial situation suffers, you put your career on hold if you want to go back in the industry, your mental and physical health suffers and you have little to no social life.

If you mean journal/research articles, well that's just how research is I'm afraid. But don't despair! You don't have to sit there and force yourself to read every word of every article because that's going to take too long and isn't the best way of retaining the information you need from the article. Here are some things I do to help with reading papers: \n\n1) Who, where, and when are good questions to start with. Who are the authors? You should pay the most attention to the first and the corresponding authors, because that's usually how you'll reference the work and you'll likely want to see their other work. Where was the article published, meaning which journal. What's the impact of the work, and how often has it been cited if it's older? When was it published? If it was 10 years ago, there will likely be more recent papers that you'll need to keep in mind. \n\n2) Unless it's a completely new topic for me, I generally skip the introduction, or at most skim over it. They're just rehashing other review articles and prior research to lead into their research. I do try to pay attention to who they're referencing though, because it might reveal other papers I need to read. \n\n3) What are the main conclusions, and do the data in the figures support what's written in the text? You'll be surprised at how often results are... dare I say over-stated? Not that there's any manipulation or anything actually wrong, but a 5% difference in viability with your new drug isn't really much of a difference, and I don't care how tight the error bars are or if it's a p&lt;0.0001. /endrant\n\n4) HOW DO THEIR DATA AND CONCLUSIONS FIT IN WITH YOUR WORK?! Sorry for the all caps, but this is really the most important. If you keep this in mind while you're reading, you'll be able to use the information to help drive your hypotheses and experimental approaches. And you'll be able to retain the information better, because you've quite selfishly (and rightly) made it about YOU and YOUR RESEARCH.  \n\n5) What questions does this research open up, and what are the next steps? Don't just write down what they've written in the Discussion. If you're linking it back to your own work, you can tailor the open questions to be more relevant to you. \n\nI know it seems daunting, and like this is a lot more work than just reading a paper. But a really good quote that took me a long time to understand is \"Reading without comprehension is like eating without digestion\". You go through the movement, but you never get any of the nutrients that you NEED.  And your Quals are designed to help you learn this. It will take time, and you'll be slow at first.

I would suggest not to worry too much. Worrying little os okay, but too much is not okay. Too much worry makes moving ahead much harder. \n\nAs you have mentioned about your work on literature review and some other activities are already done,  which means you have some base. \n\nGet a proper structure for writing thesis from your professor. If you have that already then you have a ready structure to fill with details. Have a rough final conclusion that you are looking to reach for. \n\nNow to working with the remaining portion. Since you already have a rough conclusion that you are expecting, the basic topics that lead towards the conclusion should be able to derived easily. You can plan your introduction and methodology with that. Then comes the main part of your thesis which includes the work that you are proposing. Take help of multiple sources of research papers and books relevant to your work and take the points required from there. Whatever you do from here will help you form a concrete results and so your rough conclusion may remain same or change to some extent. \n\nNow, to fill the gap for internships and relevant work experience you should look for virtual internships available, you should be able to find something relevant. Virtual internships are of very short time period and you'll be able to have internships in multiple companies. These internships are counted under \"extra curricular activities\" and not \"experience\", but they are good. If industries like your work, they might just hire you. So it's a win win situation anyways. \nIf you are dealing with programming,  I advise you to have some side projects which can shown on GitHub. They show you have skills. If 2022 is you aim for getting into a PhD then do try to get into teaching on part-time basis at your university or somewhere else where you can have it. Having an experience of teaching(6months and +) is also a plus point when considered for PhD. Only part-time is recommended as you need time for your own work. \n\nOkay,  could have written more but I got to go now super quick.

Three important things I've gathered after doing my first year: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Spend your first few weeks setting up an organisation system for yourself, including managing literature (zotero is really good), having a system for regularly backing up your work and try to have it automated (hard copies and cloud based, e.g. google drive, dropbox), and find what you like for keeping track of your own work (I use 100% digital and highly recommend notion, evernote, google docs and google slides). I take meeting minutes of every weekly meeting I have with my supervisor which has been a life saver - doesn't have to be long, just a summary of the last week, questions / discussion points, some plots if relevant and then a list of things to work on until the next meeting.   \n\n* Don't compromise on time off (holidays if you get them or can take them) and daily / weekly time off. Make sure you have time for things outside of your PhD, e.g. family, friends, sports, exercise, hobbies, whatever makes you happy. Don't let it consume your life. As they say often here, it is a marathon not a sprint. Of course, you probably chose to do a PhD because you're extremely passionate and willing to work hard, but you don't need to kill yourself to do it. Nothing is worth hurting your physical/mental health, not even a doctorate.   \n\n* If you feel like you're lost and have no idea what you're doing that is 100% normal. Read, ask questions, speak to people, stay curious, but don't feel bad if you can't understand papers or what people are talking about in meetings. It's normal :) And if you have some days where you cannot work or you're frustrated or sick of your project, that's okay, it happens.

Always talk to other students in their lab and ask what the atmosphere feels like.
