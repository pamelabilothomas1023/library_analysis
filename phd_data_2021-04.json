I generally try to knock them out in the morning, before I do any actual work. Habits include anki decks, workout, meditation, etc. Generally spend about an hour doing this. I track habits in notion.\n\n* Sunday: Create weekly todo list in notion (this is a template). I fill in my known tasks into days, and I try to think of daily \"themes\". That way I dedicate whole days to certain tasks that all work toward a common goal (like I might have 1 day where I work on tasks related to the courses I teach), and I'm not task switching between wildly different tasks all day. I write a short list of general, overall goals for the week I will try to meet. I also write down my thoughts on the week, just to help me focus on what I think is important. This doesn't take very long (maybe 20-30 minutes), but it makes a huge difference to my productivity during the work week. \n\n*  Most weekdays (sans-wednesday): As I have meetings and things come up, I add things to my todo list. I also attempt to do things on my todo lists throughout the day. If I'm ever not sure what to work on next, I pick a todo item and start working on it. I'm always careful to write SMART todo items, so each point should be finishable in about 30 minutes of work. I generally have an idea of the importance of some todo items over others. I keep the priority in my head, but not the actual tasks.\n\n* Wednesday: I've been calling this \"weekend wednesday\", but it's not really a weekend. It's the day I set aside specifically without scheduled tasks. My only two tasks are \"do previous tasks\" and \"get ahead on upcoming tasks\". I often find that some todo items take significantly longer than expected, so wednesday is there so I don't fall too far behind (or that I can get a jump on upcoming stuff if I'm actually on track for the week). I definitely do considerably less on wednesdays than I do the rest of the week, but I think my overall productivity matches my peers who don't manage their time well, so I'm fine. \n\n* Saturday: This is a weekend, so I obviously don't do any work. However, I do a \"weekly reflection\" (this is a part of my weekly todo template in notion), where I think about what I did over the past week. It helps me realize what I'm actually getting done, as sometimes it can feel like you're just walking on a treadmill unless you take the time to actually look at where you've walked. It also helps me recognize where I need to change, and what I need to focus on in the next week. It also helps me manage my mental health, which with lockdown is a bigger and bigger consideration for me.\n\nI know some of that will sound \"new agey\", and I'd be the first to roll my eyes at myself. But I won't knock something until I've tried it, so I tried the new-agey \"weekly reflection\" bullshit, and annoyingly, it worked. My productivity massively shot up since I wasn't keeping todo items in my brain or on paper, but actually putting them in a place that made sense. And regularly taking stock of where I was and being mindful of that, helps me better plan for where I need to go. \n\nI've also gotten better at setting goals for myself as a result of regularly thinking about the tasks I set for myself. A couple months ago, before I started all this, I would set goals like \"Write the X section of Y paper\", which is not a SMART goal. Instead, I now use writing goals of \"Write 2 paragraphs in X section of Y paper\". Usually I'll write more, but even having the bare minimum means I can get quite a lot done even with significantly smaller goals. Having many small goals that you can almost definitely complete is so much better than having 1 massive goal that you're unlikely to complete. It turns out, I'd been writing TERRIBLE todo items for myself, but since I wasn't regularly reflecting on those todo items, I wasn't changing what I was doing.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mi0puu/phd_daily_routine/gt36pay/"}, "116": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Flight_Sufficient", "Date": 1617321570, "Score": 3, "Body": "Priorities will definitely change too -- for me, last week was a write grants week.

(Reminder, you can stay past the conference dates and travel/sightsee for a vacation, transportation back is normally covered, it just the extra hotel/food costs won't be). It's also useful for networking with people, especially if you have interest working abroad after your PhD. Again, dependent on your field, program/lab allowances, and with COVID restrictions, some disciplines offer workshops in different locations or the possibility to work for a summer or other length of time at another campus to pick up technical skills. This can be another great way to get some travelling in! Plus they look good on a resume/CV.\n\nIf you want to travel using vacation time, that's something to discuss with your advisor. If you are GRA or GTA-supported with a stipend, you probably won't be able to travel more than 2-3 weeks out of the year since you are an employee of the university (basically, summer and winter breaks don't extend to lab-related work or you may be required to TA summer classes). If you are in a wet-lab, especially if you have a GRA, you don't get off often since the summer gives you free time without classes or seminars to make headway on large experiments for your dissertation work. Your graduate contracts often won't give much in way of guaranteed time off, that's often left to the advisor's discretion, but they may have expected work-hour clauses that you can discuss with your department or advisors. But you should also keep in mind that the more time you take off away from work, the longer it may take to complete your PhD. And your advisor or program may also not be happy with your delayed progress.\n\nIf you want to spend more time abroad and work all online, that will depend heavily on your program's requirements and your lab/advisor. For many fields, especially wet-lab, that's often not an option, but some fields may allow this after the first 1-2 years of classes. I know a lot of programs are struggling with these requirements right now because of pandemic-induced visa and travel issues for international students since the first 1-2 years is often how you get to know others in your program and build a community to support yourself during your PhD, something a lot harder to do if you're far apart. Regardless, you will most likely have to come back to the campus for major exams/committee meetings if they don't support virtual at the time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mikdp7/phd_and_travels/gt60zms/"}, "202": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SamuraiBrz", "Date": 1617389053, "Score": 2, "Body": "I'm not in engineering, but business.

For example, there are tons of PhD programs in marketing (my field).

Because there aren't so many schools doing this kind of research. You need to apply to the programs that do this kind of research. You often can find a program that is low ranked for the field, but that has some of the best researchers in the world for your research interests. Some top researchers even prefer to work for lower-ranked programs because they have more freedom and power there.\n\nRank is secondary. And, if you make a list of school based on fit, you will probably get a wide range of schools in terms of rankings. Because it's not so common to have universities that are close in rank to be researching the same things.

You will increase your chances of getting in top school for PhD if you have lab or specific research experience whether through academics (Masters thesis and lab research at school) and/or industry experience ( in similar area).\n\nMany professors look for professional skills, writing skills, aptitude to understand the topic, presentation skills, communication skills. It is assumed that you have at least developed these skills (if not mastered) while working on thesis or organizations.\n\nMost important thing to master before PhD is how you can present your own research ( which is boring to others most of the times) to almost any type of audience.....lot goes when you make presentation ( if you want it to be very interesting). You have to understand audience...(students vs experts vs your mom/pop). Then you have to make slides accordingly. And then lot of other steps to make it very interesting talk. So if you work as grad student, be sure to master writing and presenting skills. If possible, publish your paper of MS thesis ( very rare in MS but can get you ahead).\n\nBasically, US news rank is joke. No doubt top university makes it way easier but ranking counts stupid things like campus life rating and lot of crap. Keep your work at top level and have proof of it to show your skills by writing or presenting or by any other academic mean and it will help you in PhD application.  Professors also check your SOP and resume and CV not only for records. They try to understand your writing skills. So they judge you whatever things they have in hands to make sure you stand out. So if your research paper is accessible that is great thing (again very few people do it at MS level).\n\nHopefully this helps. Don't think much about college ranking at MS or BS level. In my opinion, second option is better since you can go for thesis. Grad school is all about working on own priorities. If I have to choose in between two and if I know I will go for PhD, then I will choose to get involved in thesis option and will try to join research team at MS. Plus research assistantship can pay you stipend and waive tuition if you are working on any funded project under professor. If not, the professor can hook you up with teaching assistantship if you request and if you have good relationship with him or her.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mjuj47/does_your_master_degree_university_ranking_affect/gtdg7wb/"}, "395": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Maedhbh", "Date": 1617562544, "Score": 10, "Body": "Email your first choice.

I just attended a conference where I was convinced I did not have any business being. I felt inadequate because my writing has been criticized for being weak and disorganized. My concepts always caused confusion with my faculty, so I thought that they were bad ideas. Turns out, my area of study is a foreign one to them. When I presented to fellow scholars of the topic area of my interest, it was received well and I was able to experience engaging conversation and constructive feedback on my ideas. It was extremely affirming and encouraging. \n\nEven if you are worried that things do not make sense, fear not. The point of presenting at these forums are to help us as doctoral students to hone our skills and develop our ideas. If folks do not immediately understand your topic, it means that on some level, it is a unique contribution to the field! That is a good thing. Practicing in situations like this can help you develop confidence in yourself and your ideas, but I completely understand and want to validate your feelings. It's difficult to think about it rationally when you're faced with a daunting task, but I wish you all the luck and am sending good juju your way. I hope you have a similar experience to mine last week and make it through the event with a renewed sense of self and confidence in your philosophy. \n\nYou got this.

Sometimes you only get through a chapter of a book per day. But if it *is* taking that long, hopefully it means it's important... And as you continue, you'll learn to recognise what is critically important, and what you can pass over a little more lightly.\n\nIf you're in the social sciences, you're going to really, *really* need to understand the arguments that authors are making, and without a rigorous note-taking method, you're at risk of mis-representing them, or just coming back and thinking \"I have no idea what this is about\" (as you mention is already happening). A quick once-over read and onto the next one just isn't going to cut it: not for the core texts, not for the arguments that you have to understand inside out, upside-down and back-to-front. \n\nI have no idea how other people do it, I've never looked into systems or methods or anything like this - I worked out what works for me by trial and error, so this may not work for you, but what I do is this:\n\nFirstly, each paper or book gets its own Word file. Inside that file goes the bibliographical details of the work (which is also copied into a working bibliography in a separate file), and an 'overview' section. However, I do not fill in the 'overview' section until the very end of the process: it sits at the top of the page, but I come back here to fill it in at the end.\n\nI read. As I read, I write my own summations *\\[in italics\\]* of what the author is arguing. Sometimes, when it's not something I'm likely to draw upon, in short summary points (such as \"*Outlines some lessons that can be taken from classical sociology towards a new social ontology, which he argues contemporary sociology has largely forgotten*\"). \n\nBut when I get to those bits that I *really* need to understand, I get detailed - as detailed as I need to. Sometimes on a sentence-by-sentence basis, sometimes on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis, I will do a quick summary of what the author intends to say (or what I understand they are saying!), followed by the relevant quotations, including citation details. Most quotes are listed as bullet-points to make them quick and easy to identify on a skim-through, but if they are in the same line of text as my summation, they are *not* in italics (and are in quotation marks), again to make them easy to find.\n\nIn amongst this, I will write down my own thoughts, arguments, criticisms or suggestions of how this relates to my wider work **in bold**. Again, easy to identify quickly.\n\nOnce I am through, I'll return to the overview at the top of the page and write a few sentences summarising the flow of the argument. I then go over to a spreadsheet which lists everything that I have read under relevant subject tabs, and copy in the author, title, overview, and list some key words. This way, when I come back to this stuff after a long time away, I can quickly see everything that I have read on each subject area, how they all relate, and can identify which arguments to return to.\n\nThis might seem like a lot of work, and I suppose it is. But what it means is that you *really* understand what you've read. You can't just skip over it, you can't just write down a couple of quotes out-of-context and misunderstand them later. It also means that you can rely on your own notes for the majority of referencing in your writing, so you don't need to fish through piles of books and papers to find your supporting materials.\n\nThe key here is *understanding* \\- not just of the text you are reading at the moment, but how they all connect together. Who criticised who, and why, and which argument you agree with. Why you don't agree with other ones. And you simply cannot hold all that information in your head. It is too much. You need depth, detail, and clarity - and that unfortunately means that, yes, it takes a long time!

My advice is know the techniques and approaches you use well. Look into how the approaches work in general and for answering your research questions in particular. Learn what limitations those approaches have. And, most importantly, mention alternative approaches if something doesn't work in your research. You may be prodded about your research's background, but that's generally the easiest to defend since it's what you probably are most familiar with from writing up proposals, writing reviews, or presenting your work. But the \"limitations &amp; alternative approaches\" section of your grant is where they will test your reasoning for selecting certain study ideas, making certain experimental decisions, and is also the part that is often applicable to other studies in your field. You may get unrelated questions here on whether you know the appropriateness of those same techniques to a different situation or study, which is testing your understanding of the technique.\n\nAlso, know your committee. If a member has strengths in certain areas, they are more likely to ask questions in that area. If they've previously asked you questions during committee meetings about certain aspects, be sure you are prepared to address them if they come up. And if someone else has gone through a candidacy exam with one or more of them, ask them for advise of what kind of questions they may give if you're not sure.\n\nIf you're worried about the writing aspect, read a lot of grants from your committee members if they're available and of others in your program that already pasted their candidacy. Get an idea of what sections take up the most room, how they write in those sections (I'm always prosy, so it took a lot for me to whittle down my writing to the more concise expectations for grants), and what limitations and alternative approaches they mention. But if you're giving a presentation as well, the grant serves as a generator of questions for the committee rather than the main exam in my experience. You want it to meet the standards, of course, but a good presentation showing your competency will help support where you may be lacking in grantsmanship. \n\nIf you just get an oral exam panel/straight questioning, this can be more nerve-wracking, but the same applies that solid answers can defend unclear, weak, or \"not enough room to explain due to page limits\" writing. I would highly suggest having friends, both in and outside of your field, drill you on how techniques work and about concepts. You can practice drawing things out (chalk-talk style). And, if you can explain it to someone outside of your field, it shows you understand it enough to simplify which is a big step towards mastering it and being comfortable getting questions on it.\n\nLastly, remember they don't WANT to fail you. There's been significant time and energy invested in you already. They have to test you, but no one wants you to not pass, and most likely you wouldn't be allowed to take this exam if more than 1 of them thought you weren't ready yet. The same goes for your PhD defense.  Realizing that really helped steady my nerves before I went in.

No. Do I wish I thought more about what I wanted to do after my PhD before wasting time taking classes/focusing research on something that would be more useful after? 100% yes. **So I would recommend really thinking about WHY you want a PhD, and actually asking if it would be useful/necessary to have after you receive the degree, or if you're just using it to put off having to find another job for now. The PhD isn't the endgame, it's the job after that is.**\n\nDon't do a PhD just to do a PhD. Do a PhD if the job you want after it requires it. PhDs do not just open doors for you or anything, and often can make things more difficult because your field becomes so niche. Like, if a company or research institute wants someone who has a PhD in polymer chemistry, they probably won't want you if you have a PhD in analytical chemistry (not a chemist, so maybe these overlap more than I know, but hopefully you get the point). A lot of people finish their PhD thinking companies/institutes will be lining up to hire them, but that's not true.

I am thrown in to TA courses I haven't taught before or ever taken. I'm a first year and already completely swamped with coursework alone, and I'm doing my best to complete each of these labs at least once before I'm asked to teach them. I haven't had a single lab remotely go according to schedule. Each lab at this university is hacked together. I'm currently TA'ing a course which depends heavily on matlab for data processing and I've never used it a day in my life before this course.\n\nI TA'd for almost five years at my previous university. I had an extended undergrad and masters. I love TA'ing and I never felt lost and was there to support the students. Here I simply can't. \n\nIf I have a question about a protocol the stockroom is staffed by people as new as me. I haven't seen the instructor of a lab stay in the building for more than the first 5 minutes of lab and that's only even happened about twice. They don't respond to emails, texts, or any of the routes that they themselves provide for me to contact them. The lab manuals are almost complete garbage and two instructors teaching the same course will have WILDLY different requirements of their students. My last lab literally had an instructor giving custom lab manuals with entirely different experiments than the other instructors. \n\nWe have backup TA's assigned if there are more than 5 lab sections. These people are supposed to meet directly with the instructors and they circulate through the labs while they are going to provide support. These support people are just worse off than us though, because these meetings never happen and without and hands on experience in the lab how are they supposed to even know what's going wrong? My support TA normally just leaves about 5 minutes into lab. I ask her questions, she just says IDK and tells me I should email the prof.\n\nI want to do these students a solid but I have no more energy to do anything and it's swimming upstream to do anything the right way. I'm not even going to get started on the way classes are structured here but it certainly feels like I'm on the other side of this same deal when I'm in class. \n\nThere is so much stress with the rest of this PhD process and I'm having my fill of all of that. But being forced to be the one treating other human beings like shit because no one cares about their success even enough to put their labs together is killing me.

After that the number one-five advice I have is to network. Network the whole time you\u2019re In grad school. Every conference you attend - and you should attend probably minimum one per year - talk to every person you can. In the line for food, at poster sessions. Talk to everyone. If you find people you like or who you find interesting, keep in touch with them. Go to the same conference next year and find them again. Exchange business cards (idk that could be dated now but it probably isn\u2019t, most people have terrible memories). When it\u2019s time to look for jobs reach out to those people - who knows some of them might have openings or their friends will. Another thing, and it is what I did but it\u2019s not mandatory, is a lot of industries have postdoc positions.

I studied full time and worked every weekend, and sometimes nights during the week, at odd jobs to make ends meet for the first three years. After this, I dropped the jobs and relied on teaching and family for financial support. I highly recommend if your supervisors can pay you a stipend or a partial stipend then please accept this as it will make life a lot easier and you can put a deadline on it so that it will motivate you to finish by the time your supervisor's money runs out. \n\nThe biggest impact was on my mental health. Before I started I thought \"things can't get any worse than they are right now\". But they can and they do. It is hard to find your self-worth in a situation where you are not getting paid, while everyone else around you is, and in an environment like academia where students are heavily taken advantage of. I made progress towards my PhD at the cost of my confidence, self-esteem, and motivation. In me, this has manifested in many self-destructive/sabotaging behaviours and emotional weakness that I know will take a long time to recover from, if at all. Looking back, I did not feel like I was truly respected/valued by supervisor and peers and struggled to feel like a true member of my group because I did not have a scholarship like everyone else.

Marketing is extremely interdisciplinary, so being from a different field is the standard. We have people from journalism, economy, computer science, statistics, psychology, sociology, architecture, biology, etc. \n\nGPAs plays a role, of course, but it's far from being the most relevant factor for PhD applications in marketing. I would say it's one of the least relevant factors actually, unless you have a terribly awful GPA. So, I don't think your GPAs will be really a problem. \n\nI think the GMAT is much more important because you can really compare the GMAT score of different applicants. The GPA is not standardized, it may be easy to get a 4.0 from some schools, and hard to get a 3.0 from some schools, specially with applicants from all parts of the world. But GMAT is a standardized test, so it's easy to be used by schools to narrow down from hundreds of applicants to just a few of them. I'd say the bare minimum you need to plan for is 680, but I really recommend 720+ if you are able to. It's very common to see applicants with high scores, something like 700 will not make you stand out. \n\nBut a high GMAT just helps you to get your foot in the door. It's not what really leads to being accepted to a program. Things like research experience, letters of recommendation, and a strong fit between you and the program tend to be some of the most important aspects of an application. \n\nNow, you didn't tell which type of marketing research you intend to do. There are other aspects of your profile that can be relevant depending on the research track. For example, people who apply to Consumer Behavior often have experience with experiments, and people who apply to Quantitative Marketing often know how to code.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mntuoh/pursuing_a_phd_in_a_similar_but_different_field/gu0td4p/"}, "1094": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "miss_micropipette", "Date": 1618043475, "Score": 6, "Body": "LOL.

I think there are many pros and cons depending on what you want and your personality. In general I'm glad I'm doing it, but there were many difficulties. \n\nIn terms of you continuing on to a PhD some of the downsides are spending 5+ years earning very little compared to the salary you might be able to get for a normal job with a masters, having less than absolute control over where you'll live and how long you'll live there for, and having to work at odd hours in order to get things done. Plus there are things more unique to your circumstance such as whether certain tasks stress you out and how nice your advisers are. I recommend getting really kind and chill advisers.\n\nThe pros are that it's much more flexibile than most other careers and you have a good amount of autonomy. And you can exert some control over how long your PhD takes if you try hard and manage your committee well. Also I really like being able to tell people I study insects for a living and I like the feeling of doing a job that is centered around my interests and learning things rather than making money for a company, although ultimately I do teach students to make money for the university.\n\nIn terms of job prospects, in addition to industry and academia I found lots of interesting job options in the government and non-profit organizations, although none of them have hired me so far. For me I was mostly looking at USDA/EPA research positions and biology research-focused non-profits. Also, within academia you can do something besides become a professor (and TT jobs are difficult to get/retain), like working at a museum if you don't want to teach (extremely rare and competitive) or working as a lecturer if you don't care about research that much. Although lecturers earn less than professors I think. One interesting PhD industry job I didn't know much about until last year is Field Application Scientist, which is where you travel around and help researchers fix their machines or run their experiments using products from your company. It's not exactly sales because they don't need to buy stuff from you and you get to engage with research. And it pays a lot. For industry jobs in general they really like you have previous industry experience, which can be hard to do during a PhD. Also you can still get hired to teach high school but you'll be paid more for having a PhD and you might get to work at fancier schools if that's what you want. Anyway, most of the jobs I applied for required a PhD, not just a masters.

That\u2019s a rough spot to be in.  \n\nSecond, I\u2019m about to be very blunt here - I am really hoping you didn\u2019t send this. This is the kind of letter you write to make you feel better but never send. Even if this is a 100% accurate reflection of what happened (and not \u201cyour side\u201d), you come across as a bit immature, whiny, and defensive. This will not help you at all, and I think if your supervisor is as much of a jerk as it comes across here, they will just fail you anyway out of spite. Also some of these things, while valid points, are really things you should be expected to do as a PhD student. \n\nIn fact, I\u2019m about to be blunt as to why you shouldn\u2019t send it with each point you made, and how it will be received. I mean your advisor could very easily make these points about why you\u2019re a bad student who shouldn\u2019t progress. \n\n\u2014\n\n1 - your parents said this is basically like \u201cmom and dad said someone was mean to their kid\u201d. Also no need to basically say that a university professor said your advisor (another professor) was bad. \n\n2 - that\u2019s kind of your job as a PhD student. They will see this question and think you need hand holding.  If you looked at 40-50 papers sent (which is really not a lot) and THEN didn\u2019t understand, or you didn\u2019t understand something from a specific paper, that would be a better conversation. \n\n3 - sounds a lot like #2 and you sound really mad. \n\n4 - similar feedback I had to #2. Does your school have an international students center or a writing lab service?  You will have to write the dissertation yourself, not your advisor. \n\n5 - yeah that\u2019s not cool but your advisor is basically saying you are sloppy and not careful. That\u2019s an unfair assessment but I\u2019ve gotten feedback about presentation slides that aren\u2019t perfectly formatted. \n\n6 - That\u2019s because you\u2019re in hot water and they need to see what you can actually do on your own. I know your first effort was on your own, but I\u2019m imagining you got some feedback during the proposal. They want to see that feedback incorporated in the next round. \n\n7 (the closing paragraphs) - then why are you meeting with him about anything? By your assessment, you\u2019re just going to fail in 3 months. \n\n\u2014\n\nI\u2019d say to listen to your gut here. You are basically saying \u201cF you, I quit\u201d. And royally burning a bridge on your way out.  If you want to quit, that\u2019s fine. But if you want to continue in the program, you cannot send this letter. I\u2019m not sure what field you\u2019re in, but is it possible to switch advisors after this is over?\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/mnxua7/today_i_failed_my_proposal_presentation_and_wrote/gu2ab3o/"}, "1145": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Lemon_Dream_Bear", "Date": 1618076297, "Score": 2, "Body": "Congratulations!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mo4wa9/finished_my_phd_i_am_now_a_dr/gu2adg0/"}, "1146": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sigmamicro", "Date": 1618077174, "Score": 1, "Body": "Here is the permanent link to the discord server for this study group.

In NZ we have a 12 month assessment to confirm our candidature. I passed this after being enrolled for just over 6 months. Some of my colleagues, who do not work, didn't complete this until they had been granted extensions to the 18-month point. I'm now over half way through and well on track to submit within 2.5 years to allow for completion within 3 years. So, it's possible, but there are some big caveats you should be aware of: \n\nI study in NZ, which unlike the US system, has no mandatory classes. A PhD here is all thesis. \n\nI work full time, but I have pretty flexible hours, so its easy to coordinate both work and the PhD. \n\nI'm not in stem, so I have no labs. Although, I did have some fieldwork that required time off work. \n\nYou won't be networking with your colleagues at events at the University. You won't have the time. If you want a career in academia this is a lot to miss out on. \n\nYou need to be highly motivated, and prepared to kill off any semblance of a social life. \n\nI would also add that getting a PhD while working isn't as rare as you might think. Lots of lectures continue their teaching activities while working on their thesis. Also, the additional projects that PhDs take on while they do their PhD can amount to a full time job. It's all about finding a balance, which isn't easy. \n\nFinally, ask yourself why do you want to work while doing your PhD. For me it's to fulfill a broader career goal, and personal goals. If it's just to have some extra cash while you study I'd strongly advise against it.

What I think you\u2019re really asking is: I want a career that makes money, is a PhD worth it? This depends on the field. I don\u2019t know much about physics, but I do have a PhD in computer science. For computer science, it\u2019s probably not going to increase your lifetime earning potential but it\u2019s really difficult to know for sure. Doing the PhD has massively increased my aptitude in so many ways that how it benefited my career goes beyond just the piece of paper. That\u2019s the whole point of degrees, that they actually improve your ability. That being said, I would have probably made it higher in industry at least in the short term. For other fields (maybe physics?) it can be a necessary qualification for certain career paths. And of course, for anything in academia, it is usually essential.\n\nHowever, the core thing that I think that\u2019s important about this whole debate about \u201cis doing a PhD worth it\u201d. This isn\u2019t undergraduate studies, where it opens so many doors to you that the answer is pretty much always \u201cyes\u201d. This is an advanced degree that takes a lot of work and does not really have too much in the way of tangible reward. The answer for me in these questions always becomes \u201cdo a PhD if you want to do a PhD.\u201d I know that\u2019s a simple answer, but really it\u2019s true.\n\nDo you like the idea of being called doctor? Do you like the idea of pushing yourself intellectually and finding out what you\u2019re really worth? Are you willing to sacrifice several years of your short term career for that? Do you enjoy mental illness and simulating the feelings of pushing burning hot needles into your eyes? If so, maybe a PhD is for you!

I graduated on my 6th year, so had a long stretch of hating my job and despising every day... (just to briefly mention, I had to change labs and restart my whole project at the end of my 4th year which really made the whole process a nightmare)\n\nNow that I finished I decided I wanted to work in regulatory affairs, a field in which entry level jobs require only a Bachelor and I have 10+ years of study. Employers in the industry seem to value none of my PhD work, although my actual experience and skills check every single thing they are asking for... so here I am now with a PhD basically begging people to give me a chance in an internship so I can at least get experience in the field.\n\nMy parents don't understand why I went through the trouble of 6 years in a PhD to do an internship in something completely different. It doesn't help that a close friend, who graduated at the same time as me, just found a job in the industry in his field with a very good pay - so my parents keep asking me if I don't want to reconsider my decision. But to me it doesn't matter, I am not forcing myself in an environment I completely despise. I somewhat feel like I've wasted 6 years of my life and that is already enough. The truth is that I did need these years to realise I didn't want to pursue work in this field and at least pulled through and got my diploma. For what it's worth, after harassing everyone I could reach out to, I have finally found an internship and I'm really excited to start this new path.\n\nThis is just to let you know sometimes it's okay to slightly move away from your studies if it makes you happier. We all learn a lot from our PhD path even if we don't directly use this knowledge in our jobs, we still have tons of skills. It's not a waste.

While it did take some sacrifices from her (working weekends to try to get some Fridays/Mondays off) and a wicked nice and understanding mentor, she made it work.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mp2lnw/hello_all_undergrad_here/guauaes/"}, "1404": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ab67885", "Date": 1618262701, "Score": 2, "Body": "!Remindme in 1 day", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mpgayn/in_30_min_i_am_defending_my_phd/guauf2h/"}, "1405": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "silly_birb", "Date": 1618264096, "Score": 1, "Body": "I read a blog post about a guy that did a phd in neuroscience and then in 3 months learned about artificial intelligence and applied his knowledge in biology as strong point for his job in deep learning because neural network are based on the model of brain neurons.\n\nMaybe you can do the same, find something new without discarding the work you did up until know.

Do you want to keep hands-on running it for the next 3-5 years? Because if you do, then the conflict between that and a PhD is going to be significant.\n\nIf you were thinking about full-timing a PhD, you can't run the company at the same time. They are two full-to-over-full-time occupations which will constantly compete for your time, and the stress will be insane. I assume you don't want to go hands-off with the company though, as you say you want to continue your education in order to improve the company! Are you willing to let it go for the next however many years it takes to do the degree?\n\nThe other option is part-timing it, but you may still run into the same problem. I'm part-time myself, and as someone who has launched (and crashed) a couple of enterprises, I can assure you the same problem exists. It's not *just* time - although that's a huge factor - but it's your head. You need to make sure you can handle (at least) two high-stress, this-needs-doing-and-fixing-right-now major priorities.

There may be no classes (I see people here talk about classes and qualifiers, but I've never had a single one: in my field you just run to the library and try to work it out as you go). There is no guarantee of precisely what knowledge you will come out holding. What you *are* doing, is trying to discover or understand something *new*, something that *nobody has ever contributed before*. And that is a whole different thing.

Apart from the technical glitch of making the system work, I know what I would want to do with the technology and how to use it to answer a scientific question. I am just afraid that since the new postdoc has taken care of the last changes to make it work, the future development and the use of the technique will all go to him.\n\nLet's start here. I don't know the nature of this \"project\" (which isn't me asking for said details, keep that confidential).\n\nIf all that was \"solved\" was some technique and you want to utilize said technique that is tied to a project, then it comes down to the scientific questions that are asked. In that case, this whole case comes down to you developing scientific questions that can actually be answered by this, *independent* of what the postdoc is doing.\n\nThat comes down to you talking to your PI about what he or she is planning, and whether you can answer *your* question with said technique. The PI can say yes or no to this; that's just on you to be convincing. And the easiest way to do that is to ensure that whatever question you *are* asking is both in your PI's interest but also considerate of the postdoc that is also working with said technique.\n\nIf this whole thing is revolving around a *project*, then you need to understand that unless you had independently developed this thing from the start and have spoken to your PI about it, realistically *you do not own the project*. \n\n&gt; I'd be more than happy to share the project with him...\n\nThis comment really sets off red flags. You don't own the project; your PI *assigned it to you*. It's not for you to share. It's fair for the PI to assign it to someone else that can have it move forward. Sucks, but that's life.\n\nBut the language that you use is very... suspect, I think is the fairest way for me to put it, and reminds me of some personal observations on some similar goings on. Two and a half years to solve a \"technical glitch\" is a long fucking time. And honestly, I don't really see how it's relevant that you made the tools that the postdoc uses here. Just because an undergrad is told to make a couple of constructs or a technician made some sort of rig doesn't mean intellectual contribution has exactly been made on the project. \n\nThat's especially true if the postdoc figured out the issue in about 6 months. And if the postdoc was the hands and brain that solved the problem, it's not really here or there whether *you* would have solved it if the postdoc never existed.\n\nThe solution either way is to simply be honest with your PI, and hopefully negotiate something. Talk to them about where they see the project going, who is getting assigned. Ask if it's something you can also continue to work on, and if given the ok, work in concert with the postdoc (or whoever is assigned the project) what role you may work on.\n\nAll that said, what's the easiest thing to do? Personally, I would design a project around whatever is being built and see if your PI lets you work on it. Do something original that *is yours* with whatever this rig or whatnot is, but again, independent of the postdoc or anyone else. It's ideal if it's parallel to something that is going on.\n\nQuestions that may help in figuring this out:\n\n1. What specific scientific question are you going to answer in the project (think of this like the first page of a grant, with specific aims)? \n2. Is it distinct from the postdoc so that there is no cross-over?\n3. Do you have the time to do said work, while your other project is succeeding?\n4.

I'll take your advice on talking to my PI about how the technique can be used and what questions I'd like to answer with it. \n\nJust a couple of points though, I don't know how it works in the lab you work in but saying undergrads or technicians don't make intellectual contributions I think is really wrong. Even if they don't bring in big ideas or \"scientific\" ideas it doesn't mean that they don't use their tools (even intellectual) to do what is asked from them and not acknowledging that is not good. I know some labs keep students (not PhDs) and technicians out of publications for this reason, but I straight out think it's wrong. On these lines, developing tools (I don't know your background so don't know how much details I can go into) that make the experiments possible is something to acknowledge.\n\nSecondly, I understand why you'd think \"the postdoc figured out the issue in about 6 months. And if the postdoc was the hands and brain that solved the problem\". Just to put it straight, he didn't. His approach was devised by our PI, our PI designed it and ordered the main component for it, the postdoc performed an experiment because he was the newest person in the lab and needed to get used to the lab. So it is fair to say that whoever would have performed that (not even me) would have been successful, because the new design was finally correct. This is just to put it straight. \n\nBut finally, I think that because I felt so personally about this work I also came off as cagey about it. I definitely need to take some time to think about it and approach this situation from a work point of view.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mq8ol8/helpadvice_about_asking_for_credit_for_my_work/gugmdfb/"}, "1595": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "unosdias", "Date": 1618384554, "Score": 1, "Body": "I would personally do it sooner than later.

Whereas in a corporate environment, you need to be useful or at least be seen as useful, of course it's not meritocratic at the top, but the well-performing of the company still depends on the actions of the employees so there is a need to be \"useful,\" unlike in academia where you can get away with just telling others what you know, and you can get away with stuff that has neither societal nor monetary implications, like reasoning how there are more legitimately more genders or whatever than the alphabet https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/ despite overwhelming biological evidence.

I know a lot of would-be PhDs read this sub, so I'm writing this for them as much as you*\n\nHonestly, it depends on two things,\n\n1. The financials\n\n2. Your supervisor\n\nFor the financials, if doing a PhD would put you into debt, you probably shouldn't do a PhD at all. If you aren't passionate about the project, and you're facing potential debt from doing a PhD, DON'T DO IT.\n\nIf doing a PhD would damage you financially, for instance, you can't pay off other debt because you would't get paid enough, you probably shouldn't do a PhD if you're not passionate about it.\n\nAs for the second, your supervisor is the biggest factor in how much you're going to enjoy the experience. If you have a supervisor who's a huge fucking dick, you're going to hate it. If you really love your project, you can work around your supervisor. But if you aren't in love with your project, and your supervisor sucks, it's going to be awful and you'd likely quit (completely understandably).\n\nIf you're in an ok place financially (most EU PhDs are paid, so you're probably fine there), and your supervisor doesn't suck, then by all means do a PhD if you want to. It's literally just a (albeit relatively low paying) job at that point.\n\nThe issue is that a lot of PhDs are captive. Unlike a regular job, where if it sucks you can begin working to move to a different job, a PhD has a definite end. There's a lot of pressure (both externally and internally) to see it through to the end. Plus, many PhD candidates put themselves into debt to get a PhD, and that debt isn't worth it if you don't even end up with the degree (I'd argue that the debt is never worth it - but that's just me). Many PhDs suffer because they get stuck in a bad situation, and it's harder to leave than in industry.\n\nHowever, provided your supervisor doesn't suck and you're getting paid sufficiently, a PhD can just be a regular job. And just like a regular job, there will be good days and bad days. \nThis is what I do. I'm not super passionate about my project, it's just a means to get a PhD for me. What I plan on doing with that PhD, I have no idea. I got an offer to do a PhD in NL, and I'm paid decently well for it (I highly recommend NL to do a PhD). Plus, my supervisor is one of the best people on Earth, I really lucked out that I get to work with her. For me, this is a job. I treat this as a job. If I have a bad day, I don't take it personally, I just treat it as if I have a bad day in industry (and I had plenty of those when I worked in industry). This is really important for me to say (especially since I'll get downvoted to hell by those who are suffering and think I'm attacking them), **I'm really lucky to be in a position where I can treat my PhD as a job**.\n\nIf you can satisfy the two conditions I outlined at the beginning of this post, you could also treat it like a job. And then you'd be able to get a PhD in a project you're not super passionate about. I worked on plenty of projects I don't give a shit about when I worked in industry, and I didn't have a problem. Now, I do actually like my project, it's moderately interesting. But if I had the power to do a PhD in anything, I literally don't know what I'd do a PhD in.

They won\u2019t let you in a physics lab because you don\u2019t have the skills. They aren\u2019t keeping you out for some arbitrary reason. It\u2019s not that they have to make you work 5 years because they did for no reason, it\u2019s because a PhD trains you to do scientific work in your field.

They might limit your role because you need to prove yourself, but many people earn PhDs while working in labs at the same time. \n\nAlso, saying you understand better than your professors: oh boy, you have no idea. The way a professor talks to an undergraduate student is similar to how a parent talks to a child. The gloves are on, they are coddling you.

These people will take you down so many notches that the ego you have, will be significantly diminished. That\u2019s what happens to all of us at PhD land. Most of us are high achievers here.

Sure there is a lot of theory in academia and we have so many examples of work that makes no impact and has very little use, but that is something academia is striving to change.\n\nI\u2019m not really going to comment on your arguments regarding gender theory. This is quite a complicated and sensitive subject for many people, and I think it would be wise to not bring this as a tangent to a different topic. It\u2019s fine to debate these things, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the best idea when you want to discuss a physics PhD. \n\nAs for your comments on social studies PhDs: I\u2019m really hoping someone else from the sub could make an appearance and give you a much needed intellectual smackdown. You probably don\u2019t want to come here, to a PhD space; talking shit about social studies PhDs without any good evidence. Talk about stirring the hornets nest.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mp9br8/physics_phd_or_prop_trading/gujutvn/"}, "1717": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Alcool91", "Date": 1618446385, "Score": 4, "Body": "The short answer is...&gt;! I don't!&lt;\n\nMore seriously though as much as I love learning and I love my subject, in my opinion you need something outside of your program to motivate you. There will be days when you just can't bring yourself to get started. It helps to be able to call on another motivation when your passion for the subject lets you down. I have a couple of images that I try to visualize, for example I imagine myself walking outside into a woodsy area from my house, knowing that I'm taking a walk to take a break from doing important work that people count on. In this scene I'm like a movie man, I'm so successful,  and the entire world is counting on me and my research. It's so vivid, I can smell the air, it has just rained. I can hear the birds around me, and I can't hear any people. ***I want to be that man!***\n\nSometimes when I don't feel motivated I imagine that I can be that man, if I just do the work that I need to do. I ask myself what is the price I need to pay to have a life like that, and I reaffirm to myself that I am willing to pay it!\n\nHonestly something much more important (and much more difficult) than motivation is routine. If something is difficult for you, do that thing, do that thing often, keep doing that thing. Routinize the hard parts of your day to the extent that you can, and you will do better than the most motivated people that don't have good routines.\n\nI recommend two apps and one planner.\n\n1. ***Forest*** is amazing for focus. It locks you out of your phone for a preset amount of time (you can actually leave the app and use your phone, but you will 'kill your tree') I use it to implement something like the Pomodoro technique. Depending on how focused I am ('it really wavers')\n2. ***Habitica*** works so well for planning a routine. Looking back on the past several years of my life, the most productive times I can remember are times when I was using Habitica. I don't use all of the features on there, primarily dailies for daily habits, to dos for to dos, and some of the social features like guilds (where I am not active, but I occasionally check in. They have guilds just for graduate students even!).\n3. ***Panda Planner:*** Panda Planner has a lot. You will make a monthly plan, a weekly plan, and a daily plan. You will need to set a focus every day, determine things you are grateful for, make a plan for your day, and you will need to review your plan at day's end looking for what went well, and how you are going to improve. It allows me to really set some structure for my day, which I kind of need for productivity.\n\nAs far as routine, I spend a ton of time at my computer, working on coursework and/or research work. I don't like this fact (I mean the sitting, not the work). I try to force myself to walk around every day, get outside for a bit, and just generally not spend so much time sitting. I also run several days per week in the morning.\n\nYeah, I hope that answers your questions! Best of luck, and please post here whenever you find your own answers to those questions!\n\n^(Answer crossposted from) r/PhdProductivity", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mqssar/what_is_the_routine_that_keeps_you_productive/gujuxz0/"}, "1718": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ngare45", "Date": 1618447313, "Score": 1, "Body": "The main consideration should be whether you have the skills to undertake that project.

I don't really like it, and I wish there was a better tool. But short of me producing my own website in react (which I've considered multiple times), Notion does almost everything I need to do but sometimes it's a butt about it. They're releasing their API by the end of Spring (we'll see if they stick to that timeline), so hopefully that will make Notion do what I need it to do.\n\nI've used several tools, but none of them do what I need them to do. Todoist is too limited, it's great at being a todo list, but it doesn't do much else and I don't like having to switch apps - I'm whiny and I want an app that does everything I need it to do. Clickup was that app for a while, but it's way too overpower for what I need. Clickup is a massive, amazing project management tool, and I was using it to run my basic productivity tracking. It's like using chainsaw to cut a loaf of bread.\n\nI use google calendar since it has better event notification than notion. Hopefully when they API is released, I can work to sync GCalendar and Notion so I don't need to app switch. Again, I'm being whiny.\n\n## Routine\n\n\nI've stolen aspects of other productivity systems that I like. I think most people do this, and it's what I recommend.\n\nMine is to wake up and do all of my daily \"habits\" right away. So I do anki decks (mostly just Dutch vocab, but some other things I'm trying to commit to memory), work out, stretch, etc.\n\nOn Sunday, I create a weekly planning page in Notion. I fill in all my known tasks for the week. Some stuff I get from previous weeks if I didn't get it done. Other stuff is what I want to do during the week. All of my tasks are SMART tasks, and I should be able to finish most todo items in 30 minutes. I try to organize days into \"themes\", where I only work on one major project per day. Sometimes that's not possible, but I try to reduce how much switching I have to do between major projects. Also, I reflect on the previous week and write out what I think about the upcoming week. \n\nOn Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, I do my tasks. If I'm ever at a loss for what to do, I just look at the weekly productivity page and pick a task and do it. My productivity is all over the place, some days I'm crazy productive and some days I'm unable to work at all. \n\nI set aside Wednesday as \"Weekend Wednesday\". That's what I call it, but it's really \"Don't schedule shit on this Wednesday so I can not fall behind\". I found that if I was falling behind on my todo items, I'd get overwhelmed and get less done. So Wednesday is set aside for catching up on tasks from Monday and Tuesday that I couldn't finish, or getting ahead on tasks from Thursday and Friday. I also try to schedule other stuff (like doctors appointments) on Wednesdays to minimize the disruption to my routine. Basically, Wednesday is specifically set aside so that I can get my weekly routine back on track, because something breaks it every week.\n\n\n\n## Reflections\n\n\nOne thing I started doing was weekly, monthly and quarterly (\"seasonal\") reflections. It sounds like new-agey bullshit (and it really is new-agey bullshit), and I definitely rolled my eyes at it. But I live in NL, and permalockdown is taking its toll on my mental health, so I figure I would try using regular reflections as a means to stay grounded and hopefully not get work.\n\n**And I'm actually really annoyed that it worked**. I mean, I'm happy that it worked because now I have a new, and surprisingly effective tool to manage my mental health, but I'm annoyed because I'd prefer to roll my eyes at new agey bullshit, not actively participate in it.\n\nThe way I do it is that at the beginning of every quarter (I call them \"seasons\" because that sounds better - also, I think I took this from CGPGrey), I write a list of macro goals I'd like to get accomplished during the season. These goals are not SMART at all. I then write how I feel about the upcoming season, what I'm worried about, what I'm excited for, etc. And then I promptly close that page and don't look at it for another another month. This generally takes about 20-30 minutes or so.\n\nI do something very similar at the beginning of every month, but I have the monthly goals/reflections page easier to access in Notion, since I will use it to help coordinate my weekly tasks. At the beginning of the month, I'll look at my seasonal goals/reflections page to help guide the monthly goals. The monthly goals tend to be SMART more often than not. I also write a little about the upcoming month, and what I'm looking for out of it. This generally takes about 10-20 minutes.\n\nAnd then every week, I do something similar, but it's smaller than the month page. Maybe 1-2 weekly goals that I really want to accomplish (usually they're pretty small like \"try a new recipe\"). I also have my weekly todo on that page. I also do a weekly pre-week mindfulness and then I reflect on the week at the end. The reflection aspect of this takes 5-10 minutes at most. The todo aspect is more work, but that's also directly actionable.\n\nAt the end of the month, I will think about how my month went and do a post-month reflection. I look at the reflections of each week as well as my pre-month reflections. I think about how the month went, what I'm grateful for, what I could have done better, etc. And I write all of that down. This takes 20 minutes.\n\nAnd then at the end of the season, I do the same thing. I look at the three month reflections in that season, and really take time to consider what I got done over the season, how I've improved, what I could do better, etc. The seasonal post-reflection really gives me a huge sense of closure over that quarter of the year. And I really try to leave the stress from one quarter in that quarter. I think a lot of people do this for the new year (I certainly did before this quarterly thing), but now I really make an effort to do it with every quarter, and it really helps with my mental health.\n\nBut, I hear you ask, \"**/u/Agent_Goldfish, what does this reflection thing have to do with productivity?**\" Well, if you're struggling with mental health, you're not going to be very productive. Getting your mental health in order is like step 1 when trying to be more productive. Reflection alone can't fix mental health, but it's one tool among many, and it can be a pretty effective tool. \n\nAlso, a lot of PhDs, hell, a lot of people tend to feel like they are on a treadmill. You can't see how far you've come until you take the time to actually look at where you came from. I remember toward the end of my masters thesis (before I started doing these reflections) that I felt like I would fail my masters thesis. A bunch of people told me that I did excellent work and I'd be fine, but I felt like I did so little and that it couldn't possibly be enough. Luckily, github tracks commits. I remember looking at 6 months of github commit history for my thesis project, and I submitted something like 107,000 lines of code (granted half of those are blank because spacing = nicer looking code), but still. I did so much work, and yet I had felt like I did nothing. My regular reflection schedule helps prevent me from feeling like I'm not doing anything, because I regularly focus on what I've been doing.\n\nThat's my biggest recommendation to anyone regarding productivity, PhD or not: regularly take time to reflect on what you've been doing.

Honestly, the number of times I wanted to quit, run away, and disappear and there were times when I even contemplated suicide. \n\nI will highlight a few points that I learnt over the course of my recovery. You may or may not find all of them useful:\n\n* Nothing and I repeat **Nothing** comes before your mental health: The sooner you realize this, the better it will be. It is not worth publishing 10 papers in 12 months when you feel like shit on the inside. A corollary of this is that it is ok to say no to projects and take a break to work on yourself from time-to-time.\n\n* The order is always You, Your Family, and your research: Especially when you have a kid!. It is not worth staying up late in the lab if you are missing the precious moments with your kid or your partner. Your kid is 3yrs old only once and if you miss that phase, you will never get it back. Even if you publish a 100 papers it is not going to be worth missing those moments.\n\n* Your research is defined by **What** you do and not **how long** it took for you to do it: Once you complete your PhD, you will realize most of the questions that people ask will focus on what you did during your research and not about how long it took for you to do the same. Everyone takes their own path and a lot of it is determined by their personal constraints too. I for one make it a point to never work on weekends. That is going to cost me a few papers but it gives me time to decompress and spend time on other things.\n\n* Your PhD is supposed to be the worst work of your career: This one is a bit counter intuitive, but think about it, assuming everyone gets a good 20-30 yrs for research, the time spent on phd takes around 3-5 yrs which is just a fraction of your total research career.  If your PhD is THE best work of your research career it means that you peaked in your early phase and did not produce anything significant afterwards. This attitude also forces students to put themselves under undue stress and pressure. The sooner you come to terms with the fact that your PhD need not be perfect, the better it is. \n\n* Have a hobby: We tend to define ourselves by what we do. And if you are spending 10-18 hrs a day on just research you are going to define yourself by your research and consequently if your research tanks (paper reject, proposal reject etc.) you will end up taking it personally. On the other hand, if you have a hobby it gives you more dimensionality and acts like a cushion. Personally, I would recommend running, origami, or legos as they are awesome stress-busters too. \n\nOh and to answer your original question \"What does it feel like when it is done\". To be honest the first time someone addressed me as Dr. a220599, my impostor syndrome kicked in instantly. I felt there was a lot I didn't know and honestly was expecting a mail saying that there had been some mistake and that I had to redo my phd allover. But then as things settle down, you come to terms with the fact that there is ALWAYS going to be a lot you don't know {to be honest, you will find it eerie when there is a lot you know}. \n\nHope this helped.

But it's not unfair for a professor to have requirements for their candidates, likely already having a decent idea of how to write an academic paper, or for those working with computers, knowing how to code.\n\nI'm doing my PhD in computer science. There's a bare minimum level of competence needed to function in the institute. If someone comes in and can't use git, they better learn quickly. That's a pretty core competence when it comes to CS, and it's not the job of the institute or the professor to train the candidate in those skills. The candidate should already know this by now.\n\nIf you are missing core skills, the fault lies with your Masters not adequate preparing you for a PhD. Not with the institution asking for you to already have those skills.\n\nWhen I enter a job in industry, I need to already know how to code.

I got hired at my dream job and continued to work on finishing my PhD, on and off, while working full-time. I had to do experiments on weekends, and the feeling of burnout was very real. Having two kids made things even more challenging. \n\nWhat ended up working out for me (I\u2019m on track to defend in a couple of months) was consistency. It took me a couple of years to figure it out. I forced myself to take one full day off per week from both work and my studies, but on all other days made sure I was consistently focused on both work and school.\n\nThe way that I found motivation for this consistency of work ethic was to come up with a target page count for the dissertation, stored in a simple spreadsheet. The page goal was a bit arbitrary for sure (and a bit of a moving target), but tracking my page count helped me make a little progress nearly every single day.\n\nThe consequence of tracking my pages was thus: instead of thinking about this project as a giant dissertation, I broke it down into manageable small chunks. For example, \u201ctoday, I\u2019m going to knock out just one page of this chapter intro\u201d or \u201ctoday, I will complete one figure\u201d and no matter how small a task you accomplish, progress is progress!

It's all \"tomayto-tomahto\" at this point. There are just a few things I want to clarify.\n\nWe both agree that we have both staff and student status. We have both statuses because we sign a contract and work, but also because we have an exam and a diploma to earn at the end. Apparently there are country differences here (yes I'm in Switzerland) because I couldn't graduate without completing 12 credits of courses during my studies; maybe things are different in NL (it's a shame because classes are not useless and can expand your knowledge). Because we have both statuses doesn't mean we go around with 2 University IDs, 2 types of visas, etc. Only means that in some instances we are considered students and other instances we are considered staffs.\n\nYou bring up the example of the visa, of course you're going to have a worker visa, because you are a student who works and the limitations of the student visas are much stricter than those for worker visa. So I should hope so that PhDs get worker visas! It makes more sense to consider you a worker in the country. At my university I could register to trainings provided to staff only (like conflict and communication training or certificates trainings), but I could also register to classes without having to pay any fees like a regular student. Both statuses apply to different things according to logic. (by the way in my university I had a tuition fee, although not expensive, still had it - hence student in this particular instance)\n\nI don't know what kind of studies you did (I am a bioengineer) but I was never taught to do research. As bachelor and masters students we learn how to learn, we learn basics in different fields just enough that when asked to learn something later in our career we have foundations to learn on our own. Research is not something we are ever taught in and of itself. Even master theses don't necessarily teach you research, given that some students could perform these in the industry which wouldn't teach them anything about academic research. \n\nAs for the research learning, which is basically learning how to come up with a question after litterature reviewing, design experiments and appropriate controls, analyse, write and present your work, these are all things we have bits of pieces of knowledge prior to PhDs but we must still learn with practice. The PhD is the theoretical safe space in which you get to practice and perfect these skills, making you a researcher. You will come up with a hypothesis and might be told your subject is too broad or too narrow, you learn how to set better hypotheses. You might design experiments and not realise you didn't design appropriate controls for your experiments -&gt; This will be pointed out to you during a lab meeting and you will learn how controls are. Also I took a class about scientific writing during my PhD, something I never did before that (wasn't even offered to Masters or Bachelor students anyway), because I needed that skill now, and we could also have trainings for presentation etc. You don't start your PhD knowing how to do all of this, you have an idea and then you practice and then you learn to perfect these skills. I however expect a postdoc to know how to do all of these quite well, because their PhD diploma says they should have learned all of these skills.\n\n\n\nNow the interesting part of the conversation. Here is my issue with the whole \"expected skills\" or \"expected knowledge\" from professors: PhD projects are the equivalent of entry level jobs in the industry. Already we have a huge problem because entry level jobs in the industry are slowly morphing into \"need 2-3 years of experience to apply\" which is preposterous, we can't have PhDs morphing into this also. The issue with requiring experience for both industry and academia for entry level jobs means I'm going to have to seak this experience myself with either little to no pay or in shitty working conditions. And in countries like ours that don't allow unpaid work it becomes harder to find these learning opportunities because companies/institutes are reluctant to pay to train us.\n\nThe only expectation I could understand is that I can't come from a biological background and apply to do a PhD in nuclear physics. But there are still bridges that should be allowed. I gave the example of a colleague who had almost no programming knowledge. I didn't complain about it as you said, I mentioned her as an example. She had to learn the coding skills during her PhD, it was hard, but not impossible and she is going to graduate soon. She was given the space and time to learn, nobody took her hand and sat next to her to teach her how to code. School/University has taught her how to learn something (hence she had a masters degree) and she was able to teach herself coding. Another example is another colleague who studied math and worked in neuroscience modeling, did he know anything about neurosciences? Nope, he was grateful to be able to take a class during his PhD to catch up on this knowledge he didn't learn in his masters and learned the rest on his own. We are perfectly capable of learning many techniques and skills and don't have to be limited to our experience. When I started my PhD I was trained in electrophysiology, a technique I ended up using my whole project, I had colleagues who never had learned the technique and had to be taught. How much time did it take them? Maybe a week and then they perfected the skill on their own with practice. It's fine not to know something, just give me some time and I can learn. You mention git, I never used it before, but give me a week and I am sure I can acquire all the required knowledge from it, just learning on my own, without needing anyone to teach it to me and hence wasting their time.\n\n\nWe live in a free world, if professors want to set expectations, they are more than free to do so. But I'm also free to roll my eyes at how restrictive they are being because honestly we can learn so much outside of our defined knowledge and it should be totally fine. Just like I'm rolling my eyes at the ridiculous expectation of the industry that you should enter the job market with experience... it just makes it harder for the future generations and is stupid because nobody end up being willing to take the time to train us or give us the bit of time we need to learn our job.

Firstly, it's a way to get into academia and pursue a different trajectory within my profession, that would, I believe, make me more satisfied because I think I am a bit more cut out for that rather than practice.\n\nThe 90k loan covers the worst case scenario with all the living expenses of NY and the full tuition and healthcare for both years. I would be lending in two parts; first the 50k, and then depending on the scholarships and grants, the remainder. Working a on-campus job I'd probably be earning 16 $/h which is not much but at the end of the year it does shave some of the cost off, however it's still a lottery whether I'll get it. For the second year there's a possibility of getting a Fulbright or some different grant/scholarship (but not Columbia's) which would also help, but again, it is a high-risk-high-gain type of thing and I don't want to enroll counting on that.\n\nIf after 2 years I have a change of hearts (cause I don't have that much academic research experience) and decide that practice would be better, I would be able to repay that loan back relatively easily, without impacting my lifestyle a lot. On the other hand, if I choose and get into PhD it would really depend on how much do the stipends usually cover (hence the question). I also got an information saying that it's around 35k a year, but that this isn't the sole revenue stream for PhD candidates.\n\nSo, I was kinda grasping for straws here, hoping some people with experience would come and tell me that it could be viable due to more streams of revenue etc. Ofc this is all planning for the worst, because all of the possibilities of getting external money are highly competitive.\n\nAnother thing is, architecture PhDs aren't super popular let's say. Students usually want to start working right away, and rarely go into PhD. PhDs in arch usually deal with history and theory, which to most, isn't appealing. Due to this, there's a huge discrepancy between academia and practice, because in the end it's two very separate things that don't have much to do with each other. That being said, talking to the faculty and some of the current PhD candidates, it looks like the academic network you join really defines the coming years of your research, its exposure, and other prospects. What also speaks to this are the backgrounds of current PhD candidates at the Ivies, that you can see on their websites.  \n\n\nRegarding the lab analogy, I could do that but it would mean I am throwing away this opportunity which would make the PhD that much more possible, and I would have to take a year for \"lab work\" and try my chances next year directly applying for a PhD.  \n\n\nAfter some comments on few subreddits, it really does seem like a borderline impossible feat, but I am still hoping something will come up.

I believe it can actually be the opposite for many people. Doing a PhD is very hard, something that can help people with development, but not necessarily. People can just be crushed by the stress and anxiety, develop mental issues, etc. And a lot of academic research is so slow and so narrow, that it's easy to think that you would be making much more of a difference elsewhere. And that it would narrow your horizon instead of broadening it. \n\n\\&gt; does it normally take longer than advertised on the applications? \n\nIt can take longer. \n\nIt rarely is shorter. And, when I see that happening, is for people who noticed that a PhD is not really what they wanted. So, they don't worry that much about things like getting published or increasing their chances of getting a job in academia. \n\nResearch is hard to predict. You can work for a long time, and get no results. After all, if you knew the answers or the right way to get the answer or that there is an answer, you probably wouldn't be doing research about it. And that can affect the time you take to finish, if a whole year of effort is \"wasted\", for example. \n\n\\&gt; what is crucial to know that cannot or is hard to find on the internet?\n\nI would say the things that are specific for you, not valid for other PhD students. Each of us will get involved in different projects, in different fields, that will present different challenges. Even in the same field, same university, same department, same research track, things can be quite different. \n\nSince those things are so specific, you won't easily find them on the the internet. You probably need to find people who do things that are very close to what you intend to do, in order to know those things. \n\nFor example, if you are going to do time-series analysis, probably only people who do time-series analysis in climate change can tell what is crucial to know. \n\n\\&gt; my BSc. and MSc were very research focussed (i wrote so many academic papers resembling thesis/dissertations i lost count..) but is this enough? Or what falls under research experience? \n\nAnything related to academic research falls under research experience. Thesis, dissertations, RA experience, conference presentations, papers published, etc. \n\nNow, whether what you have is enough or not, it's hard to say. This can really be different from field to field, from country to country, or from university to university. \n\nGenerally speaking, I would say it's enough to consider it as research experience, but not enough to make you stand out from the competition. Probably there will be other applicants with more than that. So, you would need to think how can you show you're competitive.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mte8t7/tips_and_tricks_with_regards_to_whether_to_start/guzeg67/"}, "2378": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "xXLawNerdXx", "Date": 1618763832, "Score": 1, "Body": "Can relate.

I have ptsd, severe depression and anxiety, and I've recently begun medication for adhd. I have been on meds for depression for about 6 years but last year during my first year of the phd I went through some shit and had to change medication. It was brutal and impacted my work a lot. I managed to get through it by not beating myself up about how much I was achieving, how many hours I was working etc. \n\nIt sounds impossible, but as soon as I switched my mindset to be task oriented not time oriented it started to feel easier. I blocked out things like what my main needs were. This was in terms of health, physical, mental etc so this included time off, time with my partner, my psych appointments, walks, dinner.... the basics. And then in terms of the programme, what my supervisors expected from me, my milestones, hard due dates etc. \n\nFrom there I would focus on achieving tasks and I would stop counting hours. Forcing yourself to work a certain amount of hours per day or per week is going to drain you so fast. For me it made me spiral and made the imposter syndrome and all my mental health issues just surge like crazy. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to be kind to yourself. Don't over exert yourself. Force yourself to take weekends off if you can. I'm not very good at self care but I'm trying, and I think that's the most important thing during a phd. It's so easy to burn out, but if you burn out by overworking you won't get anything done anyway, which means that by taking it slow and steady you're balancing things in a much healthier way. \n\nI think people are scared to say how much they're struggling because (in my experience) no one wants people to think they can't hack it. I have only told my supervisors the bare minimum of whats been going on with me, I've told them what they need to know and I've told them when there have been big events that have really disrupted me, but apart from that I'm quite private. Covid has impacted my ability to make close friends in my programme which sucks, but I have managed to chat quite openly to a few people and I find that if you're honest others will be honest too. \n\nA little while ago I remember talking to someone in my programme who I thought was extremely onto it and organised and really intimidated me. They told me no one else tracks your hours so you need to figure out how things work for you, and no one is ever really working as much as they say they're working. Not all the time anyway, because it's not sustainable. \n\nIf you talk to someone who makes you feel bad about struggling, then they're either going through their own shit or are in a different situation to you. Don't let that get you down, it's a well known fact that people doing phds tend to struggle with mental health. \n\nSorry I'm rambling now, but I just want you to know you're not alone and if you need someone to chat to you can DM me!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mt8cfi/support_required_struggling/gv0l59n/"}, "2396": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Useful_Bread_4496", "Date": 1618784347, "Score": 3, "Body": "Yep.

It ignores the core importance of what your work needs to entail, and drives at the wrong extrinsic motivations that can, more than anything else, pigeon-hole people in positions. I'd be careful in taking the advice wholesale. PIs tend to leave out all the students and postdocs that got Nature and Science papers and completely left academia or science altogether, or didn't move up from their current position even with said \"goal' accomplished. And trust me, it's a pretty high percentage (here's a hint: your PI benefits far more from publications than you do).\n\nProgress, more than anything, is the perhaps the most important part of academic science, and the hardest to come by. Consistency provides data that allows for publications, along with a natural growth of project and ideas. It also allows flexibility to be able to handle new, riskier projects on the side which may become more lucrative, while also mitigating risk.\n\nIn my case, even in my postdoc, there was always a \"safe\" project that my PI wanted me to accomplish. But I gave myself time to develop other projects on the side, some of which ended up surpassing the original project completely. \n\nWhat I ended up with was multiple publications on several projects, and a broad knowledgebase to work off from. Some were more related than others. But progress happened regardless. It made me an attractive candidate in some circles of academia (by the end of it, though I had enough and left).\n\n&gt;However, in your opinion then, do you think I should be worrying so much then at this point about how many publications I will have by the end of this thing and the effect that will have on my career opportunities, or should I be more focused on just getting the PhD done?\n\nFocus on doing good work and learning all that you can in your experience. Good work and consistent data results in publications. The \"sexy and exciting\" stuff can happen, but oftentimes comes with higher risk that may crash, which is why ensuring you having something that works is an important thing. \n\nIf you have time and your projects are working, it's good to explore more. But at the very least you need to ensure that you have a working project that will show success. Everything else that can come on top of it is a cherry on top.\n\n&gt;I chose the project because I had just finished my MSc and I wanted to continue, but I knew if I wanted to grow as a researcher I could not continue with my old PI and his way of supervising. I wanted a more hands off supervisor that forced me to take charge of my project and his work also interested me. I guess I am also just adapting to this style of supervision, which in most cases is the lack thereof.\n\nWhich is fair, but compared to an MSc project a PhD project has a lot more depth, and it does take time to go through.\n\nIt's not a binary choice. You *can* have both here. Work on your project that is assigned, ask good questions (which you're already are doing), but also budget out the other ideas that you want to run and develop. It's worth asking your PI these things.\n\nSimply wanting to do your own project with complete independence I think is very risky, which is why your PI is a bit more wary of doing.

Most universities are fine. In undergraduate there isn't so much you can actually do to prepare yourself for a PhD, beyond taking classes that are interesting you, and exploring as many areas in your field of interest (and other fields!!) as possible.  \n\n\nThat said, there are a few things I would  comment on:  \n1. A PhD is not a race. Its not \"unfortunate\" to do a masters between in between bachelors and PhD, and in my experience, the students who didn't do a master struggle a lot, because bachelors curriculum is largely orthoginal to what doing research is like. Don't pick a university based on  how fast things will go -- pick a university that will you believe will increase your qualiity of life. Overworked students burn out.  You want friends to help you get through the hard times. You want to live in a place where you can enjoy life. All of these things help you be more productive.  \n\n\n2. Dont fuck up your financial future by taking out crazy student debt. If there is a cheaper option, go with that. Go with the cheapest options. For undergrad, nobody really cares about your school quite frankly. What you need to get out of it is a good relationship with  a few nice professors, who will help guide you on your academic journey. Pretty much any regular university will have this, and have these great people.   \n\n\n3. Lastly, here's a bit of advice that I think really helped my CV during my bachelors: do an independent study/research for a professor whose work you like. For me, this meant that I e-mailed a teacher of a course that I liked, and I asked if they needed any lab assistants. As a bachelors student, what you will do will be boring, thankless work -- but it can help open doors, and masters degree applications will like to see that you had an early start in research.   \n\n\nHope that helps. Good luck :-) Remember to enjoy the journey, and not get too tied up in the details.

People respond to emergencies by focusing and drilling down, but this becomes problematic when the emergency goes on... and on, and on. Some things are important but not urgent, and when we have the bandwidth to pay attention to all aspects of our lives, they float to the surface and we both notice them and take care of them, and enjoy them. These important things include health, relationships, and the personal/preparatory work that your future self will thank you for. I believe that these are absolutely critical to happiness, but sometimes an emergency forces us to postpone these very important things. \n\nAfter the emergency is over, the vice-grip it had on your attention fades, and you're left struggling with whether what you were paying attention to in the moment was worth what got left behind. I read a book in my 4th year of my PhD that I wish was required pre-reading for every student: \"Scarcity: Why having too little means so much.\" It describes in glorious and excruciating detail all the stupid things I've done in grad school, and points out that as long as you have situations where you don't know if you're going to have enough [of anything], you're at risk of tunnel vision and the scarcity trap.\n\nGrad school is not the only place where this surfaces. (For more examples, I highly recommend the book.) But a cheap example from my own personal background: I worked at an industry job for four years before I quit for grad school. When I walked into the place, I noticed that every coworker was overweight and had what I'll call \"computer posture.\" I was keenly interested in the work, but I'm also very athletic; having posture like that would make many of my favorite activities painful. Since everyone around me looked like that, I suspected that there were pressures I hadn't yet seen, and if it happened to me also, it would mean I'd stopped paying attention to a priority that in that current moment was very important to me. I drew a line in the sand and told my future self to reevaluate my situation if my weight left its normal bounds.\n\nThree years later, I crossed that line. Overtime was going crazy and I was not only eating badly, but sleeping and exercising badly as well. I thought it was just for a short period, but \"just a little longer\" drew out more and more until I felt like I had to leave in order to not lose who I was, and I needed to leave soon, before I ran out of the energy to do so. It was messy; it took me months to make a semi-graceful (but mostly embarrassing) exit, but the stories I got from my coworkers as I was on my way out the door chilled me to the bone. \"I would quit if I could,\" said one guy. \"I should have done it when I was farther from retirement. I've put too much into this job... I missed my aunt's last days in the hospital because of a work deadline, once. And then I did the same thing with my mother. I didn't learn. Now I'm too old and I'm stuck.\" \n\nNever. Never. Never, I swore, would I let work take something so precious from me. And yet, already, I had. By the time I left, I felt like I'd spent three and a half years doing a job that had, I dunno, looked interesting and really just eaten everything about my life that I cared about. It took me a full year to get anywhere close to normal. So much resentment, so many hot, angry tears.\n\nI tell this story for a few reasons: 1) because the PhD is not the only time you may have to choose between your job and every other thing you care about. You have learned something, and sometimes you discover where your boundaries are and how important they are after they get crossed. Now that you know, you can protect them more--whether that's pushing back harder against work; putting reminders for yourself about your true priorities in places where you might lose sight of them; making sure that even if it's just a few minutes, you daily touch base with your most important values; or setting up plans so that you're never backed into a corner quite this hard again. Three years is a long time to lose, and I've been there too and I've cried pretty hard.\n\nBut the other reason I tell this story is that, ironically, it's the reason I decided to go to grad school. I wanted to know that I had the educational and financial freedom to walk away from a toxic situation the next time one came up. Obviously, grad school has it's own issues, haha. But I'm getting stronger. My awful years beforehand gave me enough of a savings that I was able to take a leave of absence last semester to get my feet back under me and find a new lab after my advisor took the side of a labmate who was harassing me. So my past struggles gave me more power today to take care of what's important, and I hope that at some point I'll be strong enough to choose only people and places where I am allowed to be a human.\n\nLastly--I talked about the years I've lost, and the year I spent resentful while in recovery. I was. so. upset. I don't know if you're religious, but I had a lot of desperate prayers in there, and I feel like I got a strange sort of blessing in the end.\n\nI chose my grad school position *so* carefully. And even though my lab mate eventually kind of poisoned it, my first two years of my PhD were, against expectations, some of the best of my life. The trajectory I got on when I so carefully picked my major and my school and my advisor grew me ten times faster, maybe more, than where I would have been piddling along at my old job if things had been \"good enough\" that I never left. It wasn't just academically, it was socially and physically as well. A year and a half after barely being \"normal,\" I was, in most important areas, beyond where I'd expected to be after 5 years of slow and steady moving.\n\nI'm not going to say that I don't still have scars from that period of time, and I expect to be dealing with scars after this harassment situation too. What I am saying is that time time you lost, valuable as it was, can still be made up. I hope this experience can help you live your next years that much more intentionally, and that the price you paid gives you the freedom to live the life you care about more and more, after this.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mqy38m/delivered_two_weeks_ago_feeling_angry/gv841xb/"}, "2627": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "xiikjuy", "Date": 1618940043, "Score": 7, "Body": "to me:\n\nnot first/last author = et. al.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/murt61/laughs_in_pain/gv84pky/"}, "2628": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "wondering-lost-soul", "Date": 1618940457, "Score": 1, "Body": "Isnt Dunning-Kruger effect the opposite when someone dumb thinks he is genius?\nIn this case he probably isnt dumb but thinks that he is because he knows how big the universe of his studies is.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mkqgql/from_one_dummy_to_another/gv85pr1/"}, "2629": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jamiew57", "Date": 1618940897, "Score": 1, "Body": "I am glad you are seeking help.

While interviewing for different companies to do some industrial research, the overwhelming majority of my interview partners had a PhD in some field of physics and all made their way into an ML/AI context, working on more or less applied problems. In my talks, more that one of them said I'd they'd have to do it again, they'd choose a more *relevant* topic to their job now but they were all mostly competent in their field of work. \nAnd now something personal. I recently left a PhD program, which combined a specific field of physics with computational methods/ML. I chose it thinking \"it can't hurt to have some physics background in my PhD and I'll get to do ML either way. I ended up hating it and left the program despite it being a very good lab and an extremely relevant topic for the upcoming years. Now, I am trying to choose my new topic carefully to make sure I like the topic and not the possibilities it might have for a later job. As I said, I think the difference is not as big as one might think starting a PhD.

Approach your supervisor and tell them that is what you want to do. A blitz to jump start and move the project forward.

Anyways, it\u2019s a PhD life\u2019s rule that your will dislike (even hate) your advisor at some point of time till some other point of time. (Of all my colleagues I was the only one who liked my advisor for most of the duration) \n\nHow I did it? \nBefore I started I met most of the professors and talked to them about their research, funding opportunities, lab culture, expectations, requirements to graduate, team members, and other aspects that I wanted to know about.\nAfter starting my program, I took courses with each one of them, took projects with them and kind of analyzed how they were as advisors/professors. Eventually committed to an advisor. A lot of things happened between first year and third year. I had to change advisors thrice; one left the school, other forgot me (that I was a PhD student looking for funding) and the last gave me a place where I belonged. In short, if you get the advisor who is right for you then you are good to go but if otherwise then be ready for mental trauma and illnesses that might stay with you for your life. \n\nIf this sounds harsh then be prepared as that what PhD is about. You need to be like a Superman\n- tough skinned so that weapons (advisors, colleagues, reviewers, everyone else in the world) don\u2019t hurt you or your mental health\n- one track mind and there is only way ahead, I.e. moving forward\n- identify your krypton and stay away from it \n- conserve your power for your Lex Luthor\n- find your Batman, a colleague who helps you and you can rely on\n- do this and you will fly higher than anyone else \n\nIf you want to chat, I don\u2019t mine having a zoom call.

So rest assure that you don\u2019t need to drink to get to know  people. Don\u2019t do anything that you\u2019re uncomfortable with :)\n\nWith regards to peer relationships in grad school, they are quite important. Grad school can be very stressful at times and having people around you who understand your struggle is a plus. Your friends can also be great audience when you need to practice for a talk/ qualifying exam/ etc. They can also be potential collaborators for your project!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/my9xd4/the_drinking_culture_in_my_program_makes_me/gvtot4p/"}, "3146": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BelgianWaffle97", "Date": 1619363577, "Score": 0, "Body": "If you still want to be close to them without getting near alcohol, you still can use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7JxdBcCoXU) guy's technique", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/my9xd4/the_drinking_culture_in_my_program_makes_me/gvtoxjg/"}, "3147": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Aggravating_Water_39", "Date": 1619363639, "Score": 44, "Body": "Sounds like you\u2019re judging them prematurely.\nHave you given them a chance?

Note: this can be a bit of an iterative process - you'll find new papers which have new keywords that you can start with. \n\nUnfortunately, lots of papers fall through the cracks when using keywords! That's where tools like [ResearchRabbitApp.com](https://ResearchRabbitApp.com) come into play. Once you've got at least 1 starting paper, ResearchRabbit starts generating recommendations that you can explore. **As you add relevant papers to your collection, our algorithms will keep giving you more relevant and personalized recommendations!** \n\nAs u/jiiiii70 mentioned, identifying important authors (and looking through their published work) and their collaborators can be helpful - as are mindmaps and visualizations! Additionally, highly cited older work (typically seminal papers), and finding newer work can be helpful too. **You can do all of this and more in** [**our app**](https://twitter.com/RsrchRabbit/status/1382756083811426310?s=20) **which gives you fine-tuned control to explore however you like.** \n\nAdditionally, sometimes you might be looking for supporting / contradictory papers.

It's neither fair to the student to withhold or sugarcoat the truth nor to the department that is expending limited resources to fund someone unlikely to finish or meet the standards to finish. Since you were expecting this discussion prior to your defense, it seems you know this isn't out of leftfield.

I've known quite a few people in your position, some voluntarily left with a Master's when they realized academia was not for them (there's no industry pipeline in my field to make staying for the PhD worthwhile) and others were told they would be Mastered out (PhD candidacy is conditional, so nobody is guaranteed to continue even if they pass quals).

The moment you decide to pull the trigger, you realize how helpless you can be, almost like an orphan(in academia) with nowhere to go. Such transitions are best if the department is not small (ie, \\~ # faculty &gt;15). It is also more difficult if you are an international student.\n\nFor some context: My advisor was a new faculty and was a big-time bully. He was not happy with me working almost 14-16 hours every weekday and demanded more(75+ hours/week). It affected my health which finally impacted my time in the lab. That was when the gaslighting started which led to the above line. He was also going to other faculty and badmouthing about me so that I can not approach other faculty. Luckily, I had finished my Masters thesis with this guy and had published 2 papers in the last 6 months so the program coordinator was kind to me and understood the situation, and advised me to find a new advisor.\n\nI was the first in my family to go to grad school and did not know much about the inner workings of academia. Bullying by Ph.D. advisors is way more common than meets the eye and I would recommend everyone starting a Ph.D. to look up red flags to look out for in a Ph.D. advisor. No, not the ones that come up on google's first page like: Not publishing or students not publishing, etc.. , but a list of [toxic behavior](https://medium.com/@chanda/20-warning-signs-your-professors-abusing-you-9382f849348c) to look out for. It is good to know that this issue is getting attention and some universities are [placing measures](https://rise4mit.medium.com/rise-update-on-guaranteed-transitional-funding-211a2bd67ebc) to help grad students through this phase. I hope more universities take up such a cause. The best thing about leaving a toxic advisor is the fact that working towards your Ph.D. with a new advisor seems worlds opposite. Everything thing is brighter and cheerful and your health improves automatically. :)\n\nAlso, to those who are quitting with a Masters or finishing a Ph.D. with a not-so-good relation with your advisor; worry not. The situation is not as dark as you perceive it to be. Very few among the general population get through grad school and that makes you special. We just need to know how to transfer the skills we learned in grad school to the workplace.

A few things that really helped me:\n\n - Having a specific work set up. For me that's a super crappy desk but it's where I do 99% of my work (the other 1% is on the couch but that's when I need to get done things done for a major deadline so I work outside of my regular routine).\n\n - Having specific work time. You can set it to be compatible with your productivity time and/or your lab/team's schedule. I sit down at my desk at 9 or 9:30am and I'm \"on the clock\" until 6 or 7. Some of my team is 2 hours behind me so the first hour or so I get a jump on things. Then I'm usually available via IM or email until they stop working 8 or 9 my time. I do try to get up from my desk by 7 at the latest.\n\n - Having specific pre and post work routines. I try to get up at about the same time, do some morning things to jump start my day (quick workout, make breakfast, watch the news). This gets my ready to work. Then after I'm done working, I immediately start fixing dinner. Cooking is a stress relief for me so it helps me come down from work and also provides a nice structure to ending my work day and transitioning to evening, despite the fact I only moved 10 ft away from \"the office\"\n\nYou can also train your colleagues to respect your work time (and train yourself), theoretically. If they normally text you at all hours of the day a night (let's say until 1am), set a rule for yourself that you won't open your messaging app after 12:30. But then answer it first thing in the morning (I normally check emails right after waking up). So if they see that texting you at 1am will get answered by 7am, they're likely not missing out by not getting an answer for 6hrs. You can then slowly back that time up to whatever you're comfortable with. Theyll learn that their questions will get answered first thing in the morning and they can't count on you for an immediate response at unreasonable times.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n0cv3o/anyone_else_feeling_like_phds_work_more_than_ever/gw79z6t/"}, "3586": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Herosixty7", "Date": 1619634688, "Score": 2, "Body": "I second that.

I went into my doctoral program with a stringent list of requirements (livable stipend, desirable topic, better placement rates) with full knowledge that my odds of getting the job I wanted in the academy were not good. In the interest of having a back-up plan, I cultivated strong industry ties as I moved through the program. These ties often resulted in smaller consulting gigs that I would happily take in the interest of like, maybe being able to buy a condo before I turn 155 years old.\n\nAs I went along in my PhD program I took on more and more consulting projects until it reached a certain density where I had to add staff to my consulting group. However, my consulting work is always in tandem with my research or secondary to it. When I have more on my plate than I can manage with my program/teaching/what have you, I simply book fewer clients or jobs that are easier for staff to handle and don't require my particular expertise. I also strategically consult in areas related to my work where code writing, data processes, legal arguments, deliverables etc. are a lighter lift. \n\nThe result is that I split my time 80/20 across consulting and my program, but that the 20% is pretty much just \"in addition\" and not \"instead of.\" I enjoy consulting, so I will likely continue to do it in my free time after I graduate this summer, but it's not a priority for me.

The obvious reason being reduced illegal immigration from a more stable central America. But moreover, there are places in the world I would love to visit that don't feel safe or accessible. There are products that I would like to buy that are unavailable. There is more pollution than necessary due to slow development and exploitation of impoverished countries.
