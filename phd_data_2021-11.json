Is their marketability going to improve as they go through roles outside academia? Almost certainly!

I know a lot of my colleagues who are applying for jobs struggle to sell themselves in terms of these skills, not necessarily because they don't have them but because they aren't sure how to identify examples of them in their academic career. I try to get them to consider some of the following:\n\n- If a job asks for project management skills, can you sell that you have essentially just managed a project for 3-4 years? This can be tied in with things like time management, organisation skills and motivation.\n\n- If a job asks for communication skills, can you talk about how you disseminated the results of your research? Did you communicate your results to people with less technical backgrounds? This can be a really useful skill when working outside academia. This can apply to both written and oral communication.\n\n- The list can go on...\n\nI think that for most job specs you can split the list of requirements into these sorts of transferable skills and more technical skills. There is obviously a chance that you'll not have the specific technical skill that the company are asking for, but a) you may have an adjacent skill (e.g. if they want you to know Java, and you know C++), and b) I would argue that beyond doing research for 3-4 years, PhD students become experts in how to learn - any skills you don't have, you can learn (this obviously won't fly with every company, but will with some).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qk8x0w/deleted_by_user/hiv64mw/"}, "95": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bloodyceasar", "Date": 1635758643, "Score": 5, "Body": "If you are in the US and going for a postdoc, the average is $44,000/yr.

I have a short attention span, can't sit still for long, and genuinely get depressed if I spend long-hours/days spent inside working on a single project (watch the sun come up and go down). Thus, a couple things worked for me:\n\n1. Set your work period into manageable chunks throughout the day. If your plan is to work for 7-hours today, break them up into smaller 2-3 hour chunks. You can even sprinkle in small rewards or errands in between these smaller work periods, as long as you reach your set time of study, that is all that matters. I usually would eat my lunch, watch a series of YouTube videos, go grocery shopping, or walk the local university track as my break period, which in itself, was my reward for staying on task.\n2. Alternate between a \"heavy\" and \"less heavy\" work day schedule. For me, I have days where I work from 9am-5pm (8-hour study days) and other days I work 10am-2pm (4-hours) or 9am-2:00pm (5-hours). I have found that I work best when I have a day of \"heavy\" work and a day that follows that up that is a little less intensive. \n3. I usually have one day (can be two, whatever works for you) in my week that is strictly a \"self-care\" day and I do nothing academic or work-related. It's sort of a day to recharge and a reward of sorts for working hard/staying on task. \n4. If there are days where you are absolutely killing it work-wise and you are firing on all cylinders, you can always surpass your scheduled work schedule because you want to keep the momentum going. \n5. **Cheat days are ok:** We all have those days where we wake up and either feel like shit or we don't want to do anything that day. That is perfectly fine and when we academics are in the midst of taking on and attempting to finish a major project (class presentation, conference presentation, final paper) or meet a deadline (thesis/dissertation chapter deadline), we all can sometimes just hit a major wall in terms of productivity. This is ok and nothing to beat yourself up over. Just take the day off, don't beat yourself up for being unproductive/seeing yourself as lazy, and just get back to work the next day. \n6. It may also be helpful to talk to someone about your productivity issues. It definitely was helpful for me to talk to not only people I trusted and cared about, but more importantly, people who could talk from experience and know what I was going through. In a lot of cases, this was not my family, but my cohort members or trusted professors. Our family definitely are \"our rock\" and mean well when they offer words of encouragement, but many of them have no idea of the herculean task that writing a thesis/dissertation or a peer-reviewed journal article is for example and can't talk from personal experience (unless they have a higher-level degree of course). It was always comforting to be able to vent to someone about some of the issues I was going through and have someone listen to me. furthermore, it was nice to also get some helpful tips from my cohort mates/classmates in my program about how they overcame procrastination, depression, or writer's block to finish a chapter of a dissertation that I myself, was currently working on. the same goes for trusted professors, they've experienced firsthand what you have gone through and can definitely give you some tips or helpful suggestions on how to overcome missed deadlines or procrastination because at the end of the day, they want to see you graduate and succeed. \n7. Lastly, find the ideal place/location where you can get the most work done. Early on, I would lie to myself and make excuses for not being productive and say it was because working for long hours in my room was unbearable. I tried working in the library, university writing center, or Starbucks and other coffee shops. However, I knew deep down that \"my room\" was not ideal, but the best location to get work done. It all comes down to how you learn best, environment-wise, and for me, that is an environment that is noise free, quiet, nobody around, and a small, intimate location. I think we have a tendency to sometimes make excuses for our procrastination and unproductively and that was definitely me with the \"finding an ideal dissertation writing location\" and there really is no such thing, at least for me. There is no \"ideal location,\" which would be a combo of small island in the middle of the ocean mixed with sound proof room (think psych ward). All you can do is just pick the best environment choice out of the bunch, shut up, stop making excuses, take ownership/responsibility, and start writing.

Even the incoming postdocs had a sharp learning curve and probably felt the way you're feeling right now.

You're almost surely adjusting to a new city, a new University, and a new research environment doing stuff you haven't done before. Keep your head up and listen carefully to the seniors in your lab.

If one doesn\u2019t review it regularly or actively recall those information (eg. citing them in your writing) it\u2019s hard to keep them in mind. So the strategy may turn from remembering them all to being able to pick them out whenever you need. \n\nI\u2019m applying organizing methods described in this great video collection about Zotero: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXt-tu7G1H3vlRXLmGyOzeAp7ZKDK0pty", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qmat0s/how_do_yall_take_notes_effectively_when_reading/hj9hsrw/"}, "603": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "DHowitz", "Date": 1636019785, "Score": 4, "Body": "I\u2019ll echo the annotated bibliography again.

Me and my old mentor did not get along, and the constant pressure  to always generate positive results just made life miserable.\n\nThe potential cons of more experienced labs especially if they are bigger is you are looking at less one on one's with the PI and either working more independently or with a postdoc.

This is all a pretty big red flag that she doesn't seem you as an adult and is trying to maintain a parent-child relationship instead of an adult-adult relationship. Also - this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1YWcInBOgg&amp;t=53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1YWcInBOgg&amp;t=53s)\n\nI think the approach here is 3 fold.\n\n1. Learn to deal with stress better. PhDs are stressful for a lot of people and that means you have to develop new skills in your personal life to deal with that. Your source of stability and peace of mind cannot come from an external source. It can't come from work, your family, your friends, your dog, your life partner, nothing. It has to come from you. Contentment is wealth, and emotional stability, resilience, and a deep understanding of your own personal needs for happiness is absolutely essential to a fulfilling life.\n2. Cut the cord. It's weird for a parent to be calling their kid every day... It will stunt your growth / stop you from being a fully independent and self-supporting individual. A parents goal should be for their children to grow up and not need them. Doesn't seem like your mom understands that. Maybe she doesn't have a fulfilling life outside of being a mother so she's putting all her need for a purpose in life on you. But dear god do it gently... She's probably trying her best (even if her best isn't very good). Almost all parents are.\n3. Prepare for it to get worse. Your 2 months into your PhD. It's going to have some rough crunch times, some shitty days, and some horrible moments of self-doubt, panic, frustration, and depressing lonely misery. It's just part of how it goes, for better or worse. Now, that's not terrible. It's okay to hurt and feel pain, but you need to accept that it's coming and prepare for it ahead of time! The same is true with your mom... If your mom is really as attached as it seems, there will probably be some backlash while you try to become a strong independent and self assured woman. Not all parents like it when their little kids leave the nest and fly off to have their own lives. Remember to be kind to her and find other constructive ways for her and you to get along outside of the parent-child role. Become friends with her!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut honestly what the the hell do I know? I only have such strong opinions on it because I've seen the same thing a few times in other people (mostly single children where one parent was a stay at home mom/dad and their whole identity revolved around being a parent. Then as the kids become adults, the parent holds onto their previous parental identity because change is hard and they haven't really been living for herself for the past 20 years).\n\nBut seriously. Take everything I said with a grain of salt. You posted a very one-sided response as a rant and I'm bored and avoiding work so I extrapolated like crazy based on a problem I've seen in a few other people. Do not listen to me. It's probably a bad idea.

I had a UK loan when I finished my MS and was very glad to have reimbursed it by the time I applied to my PhD.\n\nSome advice I wished were given to me are these:  \n\n\\- If you do not have any/much papers or conferences presentations (under 2), maybe it is worth spending a year or two before your PhD as a Research Assistant somewhere you like. I dunno the geology field but funding (PhD stipend, awards, prizes) that are often needed in North American Academia rely a lot on your Academic CV. Even if it mean delaying your project to 2-3 years, maybe it is worth reinforcing your CV early on. Also, it is a great way to network and who know, you might even find your future PhD project - even if it is not at the same Uni. I know I wished someone said this to me.\n\n\\- I like that you started looking for supervisor or projects. I personally think that it is very important. I work in social science and I have spent a lot of time thinking about my project, to the point I actually presented it to potential supervisor. That really helped get the ball rolling. But if you have a rough idea of what interests you in geology, you can try to look for people you want to be working with/get to know more. Also, while you do this, if you find people you like, you can try to reach out by emails to them to get to know them and their research before applying to potential offers. Ask if you can speak to their current PhD students or Post-docs. You have some time to figure out who you want to work with. A PhD is a long haul, so you better get an idea of what you are signing up for.\n\n\\- You seem to be interested in US or Canada. I would also spend this time figuring out the costs of living, accommodation costs, stipends,  tuition etc. Some Universities pay better than others. Some cities are less expensive than others. Some Universities are specific about tuition/health insurance/ minimum stipend.

Like a professor here says, research is a very unusual type of job because failure is the standard. \n\n2 - The specific reasons of course depend on your research and your job. I was at an event about the differences recently, and some of the differences people mentioned were (a) how narrow the PhD knowledge is, meaning that we remain much more ignorant and outdated about other parts of the field compared to someone in industry, (b) how slow the projects are, especially compared to a dynamic industry, (c) and the low impact that we have with our work, since academic research is not as focused on solving real-world problem. So, in general a new PhD doesn't know as much as people in industry (except in that narrow field), a new PhD is slower than people in industry, and a new PhD is worse at solving real-world problems. \n\n3 - No, it's not wrong. But probably it's not enough. Virtually all of us wanted a PhD degree. And you can still see how bad things are for so many of us. \n\n4 - Ok.

AFAIK the PhD nowadays is 3+1 (unless you do it with a master, in that case is 1+3). Depending on the university your funding is at least 3 and at most 4 (this in science, different in the humanities). Don't compare with the US it is a completely different system. The length of the funding should be explicitly given in the job ad. A lot of places do 3.5: you have funding for 3 and a half years, and the last six months before the hard deadline is without pay.\n\nI know nobody who finished in 3 years. As a matter of fact I have never met anyone who has even submitted in less than 3 years. You should expect to submit your thesis in the second half of your fourth year. Then after that there is that limbo where you are waiting for your viva, doing the viva and doing corrections etc. I agree with Sea-plum5507 timeline, though my own process was a bit faster (3 and a half months between submission and award of the degree) possibly because of covid.\n\nIn my case I started my PhD November  2016, and had my viva the first week of July 2020 and had my confirmation of the  degree mid-august 2020.\n\nFinal thoughts: the PhD in the UK is not paid enough, and the system where they drop your funding before completion is nonsense.

Having experience with something doesn't mean I'm motivated to research that. Although liking something or having experience with something can be signs of motivation and purpose, there are other possibilities.   \nMy background is mostly in corporate finance, and I'm doing a PhD in marketing. So, one of the most frequent questions I get is: why not a PhD in Finance?\n\n  \nWell, I think I had enough of Finance in my life. Sure, I like the field of Finance. Sure, I have a lot of experience in Finance. But I don't see anything left in Finance that gives me a purpose. I studied and had experience with all topics I had an interest in Finance, enough to satisfy me. \n\n  \nNow, one of the problems with Corporate Finance is that we see lots of the problems in the companies but typically we are not able to solve them. For example, we can see that the company should increase sales, but we are not the ones responsible for increasing sales. Marketing seems like the logical next step. \n\nI did mention the research I did before during my masters' in Finance, and I do believe it's positive for Marketing. But I don't think that explains my motivation. \n\nCertainly there were some transferable skills, but I certainly lacked some of the most important skills. I was asked about that during my interview. I think that, more important than telling the skills I had, was to know the skills I lacked. To show I was aware of my shortcomings, and how a PhD made even more sense because then I would be able to overcome those shortcomings. \n\nAnd certainly I believe the advisor is extremely important. If I have a purpose, I need someone with similar purpose. If I have my shortcomings, I need someone who can help me to overcome them. \n\nAbout the country, I was also asked about that. Why I didn't do a PhD in my own country. And, in my case, the answer is simple. People don't do this kind of research in my country.

I became *much* better at my job once I started reminding myself that \"it's just a job\" and \"nobody's going to thank me if I work myself into a burn out\" whenever something starts to overwhelm me. It puts things back into perspective and reminds me of my priorities: First comes my own well-being, and *then* comes work, not the other way round. There is no medal for killing yourself over your work. None. At. All.\n\nBy giving less of a shit about work, I worried less about my \"performance\" (what does that even mean, lol), I became more focused on the essentials, my own health, my own goals and in turn, it made me a lot calmer and efficient at what I do. I don't waste energy anymore to make things \"perfect\" or \"great\", if less is good enough, too.\n\nMy advice, though I know it'll be hard for you to do, is to take a step back and take a proper break.

If your work relates to their work, acknowledge it and show your appreciation of their work.\n\n* **Don't overload the presentation:** I take the number of minutes, deduct 25-30% and that gives me the number of slides I should prepare (i.e. a 30min presentation would have about 20 slides to present). Anything more and you risk losing your audience because you have to move too quickly from slide to slide. It's better to have fewer slides and stay with them longer.\n\n* **Be prepared:** Prepare yourself for the discussion round by making what I call \"bonus slides\" (I put one blank slide after the final slide of the presentation and then add the bonus slides). You will look well prepared and feel so confident when someone asks \"bUt wHaT aBoUt X?\" and you can just smile, say \"great question!\", pull up your bonus slide with the figure or whatever and give them an answer. :) \n\n* **Don't overload the slides:** I found that a combination of a figure and some bullet points works best. The audience doesn't need (nor want) to read everything you say, after all, you are are already telling them. Short bullet points will be guidance enough. The bullet points also serve you as cues for you when you talk, so you don't forget anything.\n\n* **Make the presentation \"flow\":** Once you have your slides in place and know +- what you want to say in each, print them out and in between each, write a sentence that will help you transition to the next slide. It will make things *a lot* smoother. It will also give you more confidence while talking.\n\n* **Practice makes perfect:** Practice your presentation over and over again (trying to speak as freely as possible), to get the timing right. The get the flow right, write down the most crucial parts, like the first few sentences of the presentation and the transitions between the slides. If you struggle with one section, write it down, practice it until it flows.\n\nGood luck OP :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qohexl/proposal_presentation_advice/hjnmp6f/"}, "1218": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "thorlehhh", "Date": 1636278772, "Score": 1, "Body": "I completed an MRes and a Pg.DIP prior to a PhD (UK).

All to often people in positions of power in academia are abusing their positions and many don't speak out because of the repercussions and lack of action. Many institutions protect people like this, it is soul destroying. I completely understand your reluctance to report it but sending support your way &lt;3 \n\nI also did my PhD on a topic that was particularly close to my own personal experiences. My PhD was in a social science field.  In many ways my own experience was a driving force behind the PhD, inspired the project, my approach, my understanding, shaped my relationship with research participants etc. etc. My personal experiences strengthened my project in so many ways, taught me how to be critical of my positionality, but it was incredibly difficult, challenging, emotionally exhausing to research, read and write about something for my job as well as live with it on a daily basis. \n\nBeing driven by a personal experience is a strength but you must also take care of yourself. You are right that doing a PhD is mentally, emotionally and physically tasking at the best of times. It takes it's toll on our day to day lives and sometimes it becomes the only thing that matters. That is why, when you are personally connected to your work or driven by personal experience, you need to very strictly separate your worktime from your personal time so that you are not completely overwhelmed by it. Draw very firm boundaries around your work day, try not to bring work home, have hobbies and support outside of academia, take regular breaks - not just when you are at breaking point/exhausted and not just a day off here and there. Protect your evenings and weekends and do things that aren't PhD work in those times. I know spme of that might be difficult because of COVID/if you're working from home but separating work time from home time as much as possible is important because a PhD is all consuming enough. \n\nI think it is also important to have a support network in your department. I don't know if you have a close enough relationship with your current supervisor to talk about the personal connection you have with this research but I would highly encourage you to be open with at least one person in your . It doesn't need to be explicit or detailed, you don't need to name names or justify yourself in any way, but very simply, \"This project is very personal to me and is one of the reasons why I wanted to do it, to draw attention to this issue/change the system but because it is very personal, it is emotionally draining and challenging. I have a support network \\[i.e. therapist etc.\\] but I wanted to let you know as sometimes I might just need some time if it becomes too much.\"\n\nThis is not a sign of weakness or a sign that you shouldn't be doing this topic but there might be a time when you do need to step back from this project - I took numerous breaks during my PhD - and having at least one person aware on the inside will make that so much easier.\n\nPlease don't think you are alone in researching something that is related to a traumatic or personal experience you have. There are many research networks and discussions happening about \"when research gets personal\" - I don't know the ins and outs of your research but even discussions happening in qualitiative research fields are raising these issues all the time so connect out to your wider academic network in your field/discipline.\n\nYour therapist's comments are unhelpful at a point when you are already doing the PhD. Prior to starting it, a conversation about the suitability of the project might have been helpful to help you prepare for it or decide whether it was the right thing but you're now past the stage where that is helpful. It is great that you have a therapist, it is really important to have that source of support but it seems to me you'd be better working through the trauma of that experience, rather than your therapist telling you, \"you shouldn't have done this\". I think it's something worth reflecting on with her, about why that was her response, and you want to work on things that will help you manage those times when you are forced to revisit any trauma/distress. \n\nIt will be challenging, emotionally draining, exhausting, and distressing at times, but you are capable of doing this and the right support network will help you get there. One thing to remember is you have a different perspective as someone \"on the inside\", someone with lived or related experience that informs and drives your research, rather than someone standing on the outside looking in and it is a real strength and something you can do great things with.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qp6kla/did_i_choose_l_poorly/hjsdp4a/"}, "1400": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Normal_Kaleidoscope", "Date": 1636367295, "Score": 2, "Body": "Well depends I guess.

I was able to get a job in the industry after about 18 months into that post doc - I was hoping for a better salary and some stability in my life. I got bored with that job after a few years - similar reasons: I felt like I'm doing nothing and everyone is happy. My wife had problems getting a job there so we finally moved back to the place I did my PhD. I got a job here in a small but growing company making research instruments. Now, 4 years after starting, I got tired of it and quit for a  software dev job. I'm starting next month. Again, I got tired of pretending that I'm working... People around me stay in the office until late afternoon hours, I always wondered WTF are they doing here. I have mixed feelings about my PhD - I met a lot of great people along the way, however in terms of career, I feel like this was a mistake. I actually quit a prospective job to go abroad and start my PhD. after all these years I think it would be better to just stick to that job for at least a few more years and I would be much better off than I am now: PhD in physics with loans in 3 countries I will be paying back for many years to come...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/px1hx4/share_your_life_after_phd_possitive_and_negative/hjxtb58/"}, "1573": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Pizazz97", "Date": 1636468428, "Score": 9, "Body": "Not pivoting when hitting a research obstacle.

My boyfriend takes Adderall and basically the same thing happens. It\u2019s amazing to see.

I've had the same paper rejected 6 times now, going for round 7 at the end of this month. The important thing is to take some time to not think about the paper before you read the reviews. Then remember the reviews are meant to help you, not discourage you. As you read them, convert them to bullet points with a running tally of how many other reviewers mentioned the same issue. Odds are, if you thought it was worth publishing, there's just a mismatch between what you said and what they read. Often I think rejections come from a breakdown in scientific communication, not in the fundamental idea. I personally know several academic friends who have been rejected repeatedly only to later be accepted at the same or comparable conference. One friend worked on and resubmitted their paper for SEVEN YEARS. When it was finally accepted, it ended up winning Best Paper Award at the conference and now has a 3-digit citation rate.\n\nThat said, if there are comments that your related work / lit review are lacking -- that's a very good sign that there's some term you didn't know to search for, and you should consult a senior in the field or track down some State-of-the-art Reports, taxonomy papers, or meta-analyses. From personal experience I can say that failing to engage with existing scholarship can be interpreted very negatively by reviewers (remember, if they were selected to review your paper, it's likely they've published on the same topic, so cite as much relevant research as possible or risk snubbing your reviewer by failing to acknowledge their scholarship). \n\nBut for this weekend?

You may not even be feeling \u2018stressed out\u2019 at the moment, but you can be overtaxing your mind without experiencing the hallmarks we attribute to stress and being \u2018stressed out\u2019. \n\nThe fact is that some brains simply compartmentalize more efficiently than other brains when subject to environments where they must endure prolonged periods of overactivity throughout an extended period of time (i.e. years of late night studying, going to school, working/worrying about how to obtain your next grant or scholarship, somehow maintaining semi-functional personal relationships, etc). However, every overtaxed mind succumbs to cognitive deficits at some point, it\u2019s just a matter of when.\n\nMy intellectual capacity has always been relatively high while my mental endurance has been utter shit since childhood\u2014this left me in the unfortunate position of having an intense thirst for knowledge and understanding, but a mental steam-engine that could never quite keep up. The best way I can think to describe the challenge is akin to driving large cargo from Denver to Orlando. You\u2019re lucky enough to have a semi-truck that can hold the insanely heavy cargo you\u2019re trying to transport, but your semi-truck has the engine of a Ford Focus (LOL)\u2014you\u2019re gonna get there eventually, but it\u2019s going to take you quite a while and you\u2019re going to break down often along the way. \n\nBecause of this issue, I\u2019ve had the lovely \u201copportunity\u201d of finding ways to adapt. At 31 years old, I\u2019ve discovered that the fix for an overtaxed mind is all the generic shit you\u2019d assume it to be. A (full) restful nights sleep; taking time for yourself and reading a book (*cough* a book that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with school *cough*); laying down for 30 minutes and closing your eyes to listening to that \u201cnew\u201d album that came out 2 years ago by your used-to-be favorite musician/band/singer that you meant to check out but ultimately forgot about because you\u2019ve been too preoccupied with cluttering the mental shelves that used to hold pieces of your personal identity with the information you\u2019re constantly taking in and trying to retain at the forefront of your mind; running on the treadmill and *not* listening to the lecture you recorded earlier that day, but to music instead and discovering that yes, you do still find heavy metal to be disconcerting, but also find it to be (surprisingly) energizing. \n\nThe one thing that all of these examples have in common is that they all require you to make a conscious effort to be mentally present in that moment. They require you to be an active and engaged participant in the not-school-related thing you\u2019re doing. Ultimately, they\u2019re all examples of you deliberately re-focusing your conscious mind alway from school.\n\nEducational goals are demanding, so we often make the mistake of filling every available space in our lives with things relating to it (I.e. working on the second draft of our research paper during our lunch break at work).\nOur justification for cramming these things into every piece of our lives is the thought that it\u2019s a means to an end. We allow our educational goals to dig in roots and take up residence in every aspect of our lives and our present thoughts, and then justify it by telling ourselves \u201cthis is temporary\u201d or \u201cthis is just how it has to be right now\u201d. \n\nUnfortunately, doing so conditions us to do things on autopilot while we focus our mental attentions elsewhere. It initially starts as is trying to make more room for school related things in our lives, but it slowly re-wires our brain and ultimately hinders our attentions and recall abilities because we\u2019ve fucked with our brain\u2019s natural inclination to remain present in the moment. \n\nWe\u2019re all guilty of it, but it takes it\u2019s toll. Some of us are affected more extremely and more swiftly than others, but we\u2019re all affected eventually when we don\u2019t make deliberate efforts to prevent it.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qr0guo/is_anyone_else_becoming_more_forgetful/hk8s8ru/"}, "2069": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Princeofthebow", "Date": 1636663108, "Score": 2, "Body": "Hanging and pushing!\nGo for the same mate", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qqdbga/how_much_help_should_we_expect_from_our_advisors/hk8wmwv/"}, "2070": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Rusk-Tea", "Date": 1636664012, "Score": 3, "Body": "Hey!

I still debate whether it was the right thing to do from time to time but generally I think it was. \n\nNot gonna sugarcoat it and say it has been exactly easy, I can explain to you the challenges I\u2019ve had if you want to DM me but I basically had to start my career over from scratch and that really sucks but I think I\u2019m nearing a turning point after 3 years (which is much better than finishing the PhD last year or this year just to go to tenure track and continue to hate myself). The lifestyle is much nicer in general though I think I have to work twice as hard to get back on the track I was before. I\u2019ll be starting a masters program to complement the one I left with and can earn real money while I do it and not some crap stipend. I picked up some wisdom along the way about why I wasn\u2019t getting interviews in my field too and why I am now (a lot is about networking obviously the other is about targeting). \n\nMy number 1 advice is to leave with something on paper - get the masters. Im telling you you dont want to be grouped with undergrads. Youre gonna be getting a lot of questions in interviews though \u201cdo you wanna go back\u201d \u201chow come you left\u201d blah blah, recruiters are they gatekeepers and are not phd students so they dont exactly know what its like. You can also talk about your research til youre blue in the face but they will see a piece of paper and that is the only key to unlock that door. Even this week, I had a call with a recruiter for an economist position (I did an econ phd til the start of my fourth year, aced the classes, top student, double candidacy, very promising but beyond unhealthy physically and mentally and isolated and couldnt be there for people at times they needed me in ways I cant get back) anyway I talked to them about my research, my gpa, working with professors, and like my successes and all that. Their eyes were glazed over they knew nothing of what i was saying (generally used to this for like data roles but keep in mind this person is recruiting economists and im talking core economics). At the end of my spiel he just goes \u201cok so like do you have a masters degree?\u201d Like what- if i did all that stuff and even if i had like 20 publications in top journals or whatever if i chose to leave and didnt ask for a masters degree it wouldnt matter to this person and id never have gotten the interview. Same thing in interviews. You can talk about learning shit on your own, being really good at x, y, and z, etc but theyre often going to be looking for someone who\u2019s done A and even if job title A is way simpler than what youre doing and x, y, and z are the key ingredients they just won\u2019t know what to do with you. I applied for so many data analysis roles where what they were looking for wasnt someone to analyze data but \u201chow can we put this data in $10000 software and make it look pretty\u201d in one extreme example, they even threw out the treatment group and i told them that but because I think my graphs were pretty enough they didn\u2019t give me a second look. Not to toot my own horn, but they really had no idea what they were doing because they hadnt been exposed to causal data analysis before so they couldnt appreciate that a research presentation whipped up over a weekend can actually give them a lot of insights they never would get by looking at nice data visualizations. (Data viz has its place its great dont get me wrong, but truly I believe a firm tasked with data analysis that throws out its treatment group is not doing a good job; I bucked up and learned those softwares later in like a three day period when I had PTO so like they drastically overestimate how hard it is to learn those softwares at any rate). My point, however bitter I am, is that people who havent been in phd programs will not know how hard it is and how draining it is. You need the paper to at least say you were a masters student. Youll def face setbacks even still esp relative to other phds. Like im never gonna get a job where im competing with someone who finished. I never expected to and it is what it is. But you can make up for it by continuing to push yourself. When you push yourself though, to the same extent, make sure you get certificates that say you do (or build some kinda portfolio or something). I taught myself sql after grad school while I was applying for jobs and have been using it for 3 years. My skills have increased in those 3 years no doubt, but I had sat through a lot of interviews where they asked about my sql and i said i taught myself and it went nowhere (never mind that i know like 4 other programming languages). Getting a certificate i can throw on my linkedin did seem to matter though. Paper matters way more than intrinsic ability, willingness to learn, or work ethic. \n\nMy second thing is to get the job first before leaving if you can. I made the decision to leave when i was in a state of complete emotional breakdown. I took some time to myself finally brought myself out of it and then I had two back to back deaths for people that I was very close to. I kept applying and going to therapy and taking care of myself but i was so deep in depression and the constant rejection in jobs was very very challenging and just not something I needed at the moment (I was supposed to return to my pre-grad company but they f\u2019ing ghosted me after 7 interviews across 3 rounds, still extremely mad about that). My point is, you dont know what will happen in your life, the period will be challenging because if youre like me youll second guess CONSTANTLY and feel inevitably like you made a mistake and it will be a downward spiral of negativity. You can avoid that with a smoother transition if you secure a job AND THEN leave. However, if in 2018 future me told myself that I\u2019d have felt too desperate to take my own advice so I get it if you don\u2019t too. Be kind to yourself because the world won\u2019t necessarily be kind back. Many professors and PhD students are awesome but a few of them are such complete heaping piles of narcissistic garbage and exploitation that they are willing to get people deported to make their own lives marginally more comfortable (true story) or drive others to the hospital for suicidal ideation (also true story). You gotta be good to yourself and find validation in yourself and if you cant talk to me because Im on the other side of that now and feeling pretty good about my life (besides frustrations in my career that will reside soon and grief from something completely unrelated I dont care to get into). But seriously, reach out if you need it.

I am also 25/26, 3.5 years into a PhD I dislike, and constantly contemplating whether to terminate things early. TBH, I think in most situations (not necessarily yours) of whether to leave or stay in a program, I suspect there\u2019s not truly a right or wrong answer. But I get it. It totally feels that way: the two paths ahead seem very divergent,  and when you ask other people for advice, more often than not they immediately get very polarized about \\*\\*your\\*\\* decision. Lol.\n\nI\u2019m guessing your primary fear would be leaving and then feeling you have made the wrong decision. I share this fear too. But I\u2019ve recently also come to terms with the fact that if I decide to leave, and end up regretting it, the reality is that I can always reapply to get another PhD. I even imagine the chances of having a more satisfactory experience are much higher the second time around, given that I now have a better idea of what I want and do not want, and can better discern which programs/labs offer precisely that. While I\u2019ve unfortunately developed a bias of academia being a pretty negative place, I also entertain the idea that things could have gone very differently if I had simply chosen a different city/time/program/lab to be in. If, like me, you make those big decisions without first defining what it is you want/value etc., I think your chances of becoming prey to that negativity are a lot higher. And then your energy and time are drained performing damage-control for things that may have been readily prevented, at least in hindsight. Sigh. But I digress.\n\nIf you decide to leave, but don\u2019t end up regretting it, kudos to you! But regardless of whether you stay or leave, you\u2019ll need to come to terms with the fact that there are obvious short-term consequences resulting from both decisions. But there are also unknown opportunities resulting from both decisions. Oh, the places you\u2019ll go, the people you\u2019ll meet, and the times you\u2019ll have!\n\nAs other people in this thread have suggested, I would agree with taking a long term view. Not in the sense of being paranoid about something bad occurring in the future as a consequence of the decision you make now. But more so in the sense of being patient, focusing on the journey (alongside the de$tination), and prioritizing sustainability. Expand your horizon of what you\u2019ll be able to achieve and when. It\u2019s OK to cry over spilled milk, but do your best to continue moving forward as sincerely as you can.\n\nI\u2019m also in my mid 20s and pretty lost now in a very similar way. I can\u2019t really offer much of practical advice. Recently, I was reminded of the adage that \u201cthere is nothing new under the sun\u201d. I have started to turn to books (and pieces of literature/media, in general) to help me better define myself, my values and what I may want out of life. How I may possibly start moving in that direction and engage with the risks inherent to life in a healthy, tactful way. It\u2019s becoming glaringly obvious that I assumed that my current position in academia would give me the answer to these things, but it hasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not happy about that, but I am OK. One of my goals now is to seek out more like-minded communities and consume content that can help me with answering these questions.\n\nAgain, I commend you for your decision. I imagine it took a lot of courage to make. Godspeed!\n\nIf you can, update us in a year as to how it's gone.

Having the tools to clean more easily is a good step- I like to stock up at B&amp;M (a cheap homeware store in the UK) at the weekends so we have lots of cleaning products in stock to make things just a tiny bit easier to do, and have lots of multiples of stuff so that cleaning supplies are easily accessible in each room for when you have a spare second. If you can find a good budget place to buy higher quality cleaning supplies at discount, then cleaning is way quicker; using the right cleaning product for the job will save you a lot of time. Would highly recommend things like microfibre cloths, because they clean stuff way more efficiently than a rag (would double recommend if you need to get cat sick out of the carpet regularly like I do). I agree with the commenter who says to do 15 minute cleaning bursts if you can- mine tend to be more 3-5 minute cleaning bursts, but whatever works for you is good.\n\nIn terms of clutter, I find the best thing to do is have a specific place where you can dump stuff. I keep nice boxes and baskets around the house for me to dump my stuff in, e.g. when I work in the lounge I have a basket which I put my notebooks/pens/laptop charger in so they're easily accessible but not spread about the floor, and a tin on the coffee table where I drop my hair ties and bobby pins because I know I like to sit on the sofa and take my hair out when I get in (I dump it out into the boxes I keep on my dressing table when it gets full). Boxes with lids are also good, because then you don't have to look at the piles of clutter. Having a mix of temporary boxes for things that need tidying later, and permanent containers for things that always live in the same place (stationery organisers and similar) makes tidying a lot faster; things that you need to access all the time should be kept where you need them most. Keeping things like cleaning products in plastic tubs that go in the cupboards means you can just take out the whole tub to do the cleaning, then replace it in the cupboard when you're done; you only have to put one thing away rather than gathering up what you need for one job and putting each item back in the cupboard separately. Hooks have been a game-changer, my husband and I have one each in the bedroom with coat hangers on for hanging up clothes that have been worn but aren't ready for the laundry (the stuff that would usually go on the \"laundry chair\") to keep stuff off the floor, as well as one each for hanging backpacks and bags on when we get in. I'm lucky enough to be able to drill into my walls, but you can get Command hooks if you're renting, and they work pretty well. As long as you can have a place to dump stuff so it's not in the way and fairly tidy, the clutter can sit there until you have time to deal with it, and it's contained into single units that can be sorted out one at a time; you can carry a box of stuff around the house, putting it away as you go. Basically you're making cleaning up a room of stuff into little modules, that can be sorted when you have a tiny sliver of time and energy, but that don't look ugly or out of place if you don't have time to get to them. \n\nThis doesn't keep the house 100% tidy, but if everything has a rough place where it should be that's easy for you to access, you can sort things out at the weekend.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qu0up3/how_the_heck_do_you_guys_maintain_a_relatively/hkou180/"}, "2659": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MeMissBunny", "Date": 1636956337, "Score": 0, "Body": "Perhaps unrelated, but this reminded me of the book \"The Love Hypothesis\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope everything ends up well in your case :x", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qtnh52/phd_supervisor_and_cosupervisor_in_a_relationship/hkou7gh/"}, "2660": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "DangerousCranberry", "Date": 1636958076, "Score": 1, "Body": "My partner had her masters thesis supervised by a married couple, and is now doing her PhD with them too.

He has refused to do any cooking, cleaning, housework etc because he says he's too stressed out and needs to focus on the writing so this has been going on over a year now. He only takes one day off a week during which he just watches TV. They don't go out. Their intamacy has been impacted, as has their relationship. In both of these instances, it's just one person in the couple doing the PhD, the other working full time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qu9rgc/phd_and_law_school_at_the_same_time/hkprkh3/"}, "2682": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "JustBecauseOfThat", "Date": 1636982184, "Score": 2, "Body": "My wife and I did PhDs at the same time (and I am in law, used to work as an attorney before doing my PhD, but we are in Europe so the experience and education is a bit different).   \n\n\nI would really recommend that you do it at the same time.

Taking out loans for law school may be doable to pay off in a reasonable timeframe as a lawyer provided she makes above a certain amount (for arguments sake, let's say she'd make the 65th percentile for lawyer starting salaries which allows her to pay off student loans in 5 years).\n\nIf you don't have a solid plan for what you're going to do with your PhD there's no way to project out how big of a time commitment your student loans will be. Let's say you end up in a PostDoc, which are often poorly compensated. You'd be able to make some payments to your loans, but probably not aggressive ones unless your wife's salary is also going towards your loans (which needs to factor into her earning potential, maybe that means she needs to be in the 70th percentile to accommodate your loans and pay hers off in 5 years, yours off in 8). Maybe you need 2 or 3 postdocs to land a position in academia, so that's roughly 4-9 years of low income on your part and balancing paying back 2 student loans. \n\nFrom an economical standpoint, it sounds better to tag team it, but at what cost? If y'all want kids, is that something you'd want to wait until after your degrees are done? What age does that put you if you tag team it versus concurrently? Could you afford kids while working a PostDoc and paying back loans if you take them out? These are all the things to consider when designing a career trajectory. These kinds of things are often big contributors to the stress of a PhD. \n\nAnd to bring this back to the schooling itself, let's say you two decide to go concurrently and your goal is to pay back all loans within 8 years and you're aiming for academia. You also are trying to only spend 3 or fewer years as a PostDoc. Maybe the numbers add up that your wife will need to fall in the 72nd percentile for starting salaries and you need to secure a fairly competitive postdoc. You need to really build up your CV to get the postdoc and eventually secure a tenure track position (let's say 1 pub at minimum each year, aiming for 2-3 during PhD and postdoc). You're not going to get those things without making some sacrifices. You're both going to have to really exert yourselves during your degree. That may mean 6 or 7 work days per week. Long hours. High stress. You may need to work with another institution far away for a summer/semester. These are all things that could make the concurrent plan more expensive (financially, emotionally, etc) than it's worth. \n\ntl;dr you need to have a post degree plan to make this decision. Asking Reddit for advice without it is meaningless. \n\nCaveat: all examples here (seeking academia, kids, percentiles for lawyer starting salaries) are illustrative and I do not mean to imply that they apply to your situation.

I've been where you are, sort of, and this was the most important thing for me:\n\nFirstly, I looked for causes of my stress and came to the conclusion that I can only work X hours on my PhD a week. My brain cannot do good academic work for more than these hours (at least not regularly), so why would I try to force it and get stressed at the lack of results? In my country it's easy to lower your hours and have your PhD proportionally extended, so just did that.\n\nSecondly, I chose my working hours so they fit me and I stick to them. I like to stay up late to game with friends from around the world and sometimes struggle to sleep for unrelated reasons, so my working hours don't start until 10 am unless I want them to (I rarely do). This means I can sleep longer if necessary or take extra time in the morning if I'm starting to feel off (I have a very specific feeling tied to stress that I've learnt to recognize) - sometimes it means I meditate, sometimes I go for a walk, whatever I do it is to give my brain a moment to settle before moving on with my day. \n\nThirdly, I made weekly plans with local friends to ensure I see them and don't isolate (this is often the start of bad spirals for me). It also helps me keep a routine and not push things to the evenings, because I know I can't since I'm meeting up with friends. Not every day though, gotta have time to myself\n\nFourthly, I was very up front with my supervisor. I told them we either tailor things to my needs (within reason obviously) or I'll have to drop out. My supervisor was immediately on board and we discussed what I needed. For me this means I can take days off without warning so long as it doesn't interfere with the teaching I have to do and I still meet important deadlines (conferences, articles, etc). I try not to do it too often, but being able to just stay home on a random day because I had that *feeling* has been a lifesaver to me.\n\nObviously, all of this requires your supervisor and uni to work with you and I've been very lucky in that regard. Identifying what stresses you and limiting or eliminating them is key though and doing it during your  LoA means you won't \"waste\" precious PhD time doing it.\n\nAlso, often it's not that we can't do PhDs, it's that we cannot do them under the same terms as the laws prescribe and that's okay!

It's pretty good, all research based with no coursework, which I think is standard here. It will depend on the particular scholarship you are one, but standard government scholarship here is now 3 years and three months, with candidature lasting 4 years. Having said that, while some people  can do it in three years my experience is that most people lapse, and take 4-5 years. (I am near the end of 4 years myself, and will submit in a couple of weeks). \n\nCulture is pretty cruisy; everyone will be one first name basis (which I know some of my international colleagues struggle with at first haha), but anything else will depend entirely on your supervisor and co workers way more than the country. Honestly, I would factor in potential supervisors to this decision, it is the most important factor into whether your next few years will be enjoyable or not.\n\nHonestly, the big disadvantage with Australia is the distance; most conferences are overseas, and it can be expensive to go to them. For example, any conference in Europe will be at least $ 1400 (AUD, probably around 800 EUR, but not great at conversions) and 24hrs of travel,  rather then a quick trip that it is for Europeans. Sadly, we just don't get the same quality of conferences in Australia, although they do pop up sometimes. \n\nAnother difference I have been told by my professors, although can't vouch for this personally, is that we often have a more hands on approach cos we can't just buy stuff haha. I am in chemistry, and a lot of synthetic chemists here just make their starting products because three weeks in the lab is still quicker and cheaper than waiting for stuff to get posted and go through customs. We also have a few smaller institutions where everyone just knows how to use the instruments because we can't afford a tech to do it (for example, everyone in my department runs their own NMRs, which I am told is rare).

Elsewhere a master is 1-2 years with courses and thesis and a PhD is 3-4 years on average depending on the country. The PhD focuses only on the research and you don't have courses abroad. The only reason why it's like that is because in the US they accept applicants directly from their undergrad. This is not the case elsewhere as research experience is required prior to entering the PhD (gained through a master). On some rare occasions, students will be accepted in a PhD program from undergrad if they have research experience, excellent references and academic record.\n\n It's not a misconception, I think you might be confused on how the PhD is separated from the master or any hidden master requirements in other countries as you are saying the same thing (so not sure why you bring looking down on other degrees). \n\nThus, in the US: 5-7 years for a PhD only as it includes hidden master requirements (course work) and does not require a master beforehand. Outside the US: 1-2 years master + 3-4 years PhD = 4-6 years of graduate school to obtain a PhD. *If* you end up needing a master to be competitive for US PhD programs, you can add 1-2 years, so you end up spending 6-9 years in grad school to obtain a US PhD. No matter how you look at it, going abroad is shorter because you don't have to repeat any course work of other requirements similar to master programs. That's one of the main reasons why my US friends are studying abroad for their grad school.

(Sometimes minority perspectives aren\u2019t taken as seriously or acted upon as effectively *because* they\u2019re perspectives of a minority.\n\nThere are more examples than these, but I hope they provide a good start and that you\u2019ll look into this issue more.

This led to a risky pregnancy and the prospect of having 2 kids within a year and a half of each other. Ultimately, we lost the pregnancy and were devastated. I coasted along not making much progress for two years. I had to pick up a full time job to support our small family and continue my PhD on the side. As I was finally feeling better from the first pregnancy loss, my wife became pregnant and lost it again. I ended up having to take a break from the PhD because it was just too much to deal with on top of everything else I had going on. After a couple years I got the opportunity to enter back into my program and I finally finished in May of this year. My dad died the day before my commencement, which I did not attend.\n\nHonestly, loss is a part of the human experience.

A DTP is a \"doctoral training programme\" which is a collection of universities (often nearby ones) working in a similar field (e.g. Environmental Science). Funding from the UK research councils go to the DTP who then organise projects and offer studentships to candidates.\n\nI can also probably speak a bit about how the process works and what your chances are.\n\nThis is specific to our DTP and might differ in the details to other DTPs.\n\n* In our DTP, supervisors submit project proposals to the DTP. There will be more projects than places available. The ratio differs each year but it's at least 3-1 I'd guess, if not worse.\n* These get advertised (**this is happening now**, lots of adverts should be live or shortly going live). Check out the various DTP websites and they'll all be listed on there and should be on findaphd.com either now or soon (ours aren't yet!).\n* The application deadline is in January(ish) but you really want to be getting as much support from the supervisor (and they should be happy to help).\n* The supervisor will shortlist who they think is the best candidate (so make a good impression on the supervisor!)\n* You'll then go forward to interview as the single candidate assigned to that project.\n* Interviews will be Feb/March with a decision/offer made in March/April.\n* You'll be asssessed mainly on your own ability/attitude/skills/etc (not on the \"worthiness\" of the project itself).\n* If you are successful, you'll get the studentship to do the project, starting in October 2022.\n* If you're not successful, you won't get the studentship and the supervisor will get no one to do their project so it won't happen. Hence it's very much in the supervisor's own interest to get good candidates and prepare them well.\n\nSome DTPs have additional programmes in addition to what I've listed above (e.g. we have a programme for BAME students to try and readdress unrepresentation, that sits outside the system above and gives them the opportunity to define their own project).\n\nI'd suggest researching the projects you're interested in, check out the supervisor a bit (having a good supervisor is vital to your PhD). Look who they work with and what future opportunities they might offer. The project may well change direction but you're stuck with that supervisor for 4 years.\n\nMost importantly, engage with them early on (especially as the application window spans Christmas!). I've had 2 or 3 zoom meetings previously with candidates to help them prepare and the earlier the better. The forms you fill in to apply are all about scoring as many points as possible so get advice on what to write and what the panel are looking for.\n\nI think I've covered everything but if there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to drop me a message on here.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qxqoz4/im_stressy_mcstress_about_applying_for_phds/hlbil8m/"}, "3595": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "kekropian", "Date": 1637364154, "Score": 1, "Body": "Had a similar experience with mine, three years after Postdoc and while I was there they ended up with 15 students and 2 Postdocs and three different research subjects.

Let me be clear, yes the PhD is hard and yes a crappy advisor/too much workload can also lead to burnout. And yes, talking to a professional is incredibly useful and I highly recommend it.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, the main thing we all learn in our PhD journey is that there's always more work to do and we need to break down this giant, vague task into concrete tasks that we can accomplish on a day-to-day basis. If we do too much we burn out and everything takes longer and sucks way more. Your classes and research are taking a lot out of you, so you absolutely need to learn what works for you to get through it. \n\nIt sounds like you're into your PhD - that's good. It's also good you're sleeping and exercising. It also sounds like your classes are difficult - that's okay too. You won't take classes forever and most first year students get zero research done. So focus on your classes and try to relate them to what you want to do for research.\n\nWhen the shit storm hits with finals, research deadlines, etc, you're going to have late nights and it's going to suck. Your concentration will wane and you'll be slower to get things done, but if you have deadlines the only way to make up for it is sheer hours. It sucks, but you'll get a lot done. So, when you have no deadlines, chill out a little, take a weekday off, do whatever you need to do to recharge. Because the next shit storm is coming. But here's the trick - the shit storm always ends and you just need to get through it. Once your semester is over you'll have lots of time to re-focus on research. \n\nWhat you're going through is 100% normal. Some people go through that for years. The sooner you learn to manage the shit storms and recharge when things are chill, the easier time you'll have with the PhD. For now the only things you can do (besides quit) are prioritize your tasks/goals and take time off to recharge when you have it.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qyqgqw/burnout_what_to_do_looking_for_legit_not_flowery/hlhophv/"}, "3770": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lucpz", "Date": 1637486502, "Score": 2, "Body": "&gt; There is no time to take off without failing to meet minimum research or course obligations.

So I tend to focus on that 20% that actually makes most of the difference instead of working my ass off to achieve the impossible 100%.\n\nThat's particularly useful when you're still taking classes - in my and many of my peers' opinions including professors, most of your efforts should go into research, so trying to spend less time in class assignments and projects can be productive. Remember that the time saved is not necessarily a time that you'll spend on research: you can simply take this time off, *especially* if you're seeing signs of burnout.

And I see at least two major issues with that. \n\nFirst, that's totally expected. Saying that \"things are different when things are different\" sounds like proving the obvious. It would be much more surprising (and interesting, and probably relevant) if things stayed the same even if under very different contexts. Because then it would be something like an empirical generalization, a universal rule. But then only two countries is probably too little.\n\nSecond, since those contexts are so different in so many ways, will you be able to explain what exactly is the variable that matters? Cultural familiarity, language proficiency, access, etc.? Even with large sample sizes and advanced statistical procedures, it's a big challenge to pinpoint the relevance and role of each variable. With case studies, I guess the challenge is much harder. If your research shows there are differences, but you can't provide strong evidence about the explanation, then I think it's a very weak research for a PhD. \n\nSince you didn't provide the details, let me give an example to illustrate. Let's assume that you have a paper that says that dating in the US is different from dating in Japan. Well, that's not surprising, most people would say that's obvious even without any research or a PhD. And then your paper say that dating is different in each country, but you don't know why. Maybe it's cultural familiarity, maybe it's language proficiency, maybe it's access, but you you don't have evidence to affirm anything as there are tons of differences. Well, then the interested parties probably can't really do anything about it, right? If Japan wanted to improve dating in the country, it would be necessary to know what they should change (e.g., the paper should demonstrate causality of cultural familiarity on dating). \n\nAnd of course people would question your choice of countries, because US vs. Japan is not the same as US vs. Canada or Japan vs. South Korea. Unless there are only two countries that are relevant for your topic, the countries you choose will affect the conclusions you get, so any researcher could choose the countries that match their biased opinions. And that's not good science. We're not free to do whatever we want to do, because then we could manipulate the research to get the results that we want. So, if you want to use two countries, it can't be just because you want to. There should be some support for your choice, like prior literature that shows those two countries are the relevant ones for your topic.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qys6u3/multicountry_study_any_advice/hlhyrvq/"}, "3777": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Broric", "Date": 1637494039, "Score": 14, "Body": "\"making me join stupid symposiums that nothing to do with my PhD\"\n\nThose are likely some of the most important meetings you can intend.

Only 2 of my coworkers backed me up in reporting him, and my boss pushed back against doing anything against him because \"he's cute, he's a flirt, he says your underwear was showing.\" She didn't want to deal with it. Luckily, I had already had an idea of the consequences I wanted which I had put in writing, so she didn't have to do much creative thinking. My family likewise did not really help me. The lack of support made things very tough, and I really encourage you to build a good support network with this if you can, even if it means hiring people to support you. EVEN SO, it was 100% worth it!!! My biggest regret is not calling the police and pressing actual charges of sexual assault when he groped me, I was pretty young at the time and genuinely didn't know that was enough of a crime to be arrested for (and obviously my boss wasn't going to mention it). He did go on to sexually harass other people which is why I particularly regret this; I think if he'd had real consequences then he probably wouldn't have done that as much.\n\nYou may want to consider talking to a lawyer, your union representative if you have one, and/or a therapist, maybe before reporting him. Those people tend to have experience with things like this (or know someone in the field who does) and can give a little better advice. Sometimes they have more options. At the very least, they will validate you and so when you go in, you'll feel like you have back up and evidence - \"My therapist, who I started to see because of this situation, expressed extreme concern at the emotional toll of these working conditions,\" for example. Of course, mentioning the union rep and lawyer may halt conversations as those are large, serious situations where they may need more authority to proceed.

In fact, I'd suggest that you're far better off doing your favorite project as a postdoc than as a student working for someone who you don't get along with.  You have your entire career to create and pursue interesting projects.  Your PhD should be about doing something interesting *enough*, in a good environment where you can development the skills, experience, and network you need for those next steps.  \n\nAlso, realistically, lots of projects don't turn out the way you expect, especially when you're a grad student.  Something you thought of as a \"dream project\" may well turn out not to be for reasons that are only clear in hindsight.  Something that seems only \"okay\" may actually turn out to be the best thing for your career at this stage.

During that time I got married, got my pilots license and instrument rating, and started making progress on my career. I had always planned on getting a PhD, even as a teenager. Once I was in my Master's I was close to getting married so the PhD took a backseat. I put it on hold for a while until life settled out but always knew I would come back to it.

My advisor wanted me to finish quickly and push hard so having someone who was dedicated and knew for sure this is what I wanted to do play a positive role in my selection.\n\nA big con with my approach is I worked full time during the day and spent nights and weekends doing my grad work.

But it also afforded me the ability to align my dissertation to a topic area I had been working for years which allowed quick progress.

Experience was important to explain my research interests and my motivation to do research and stay in academia.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; What was the hardest part? \n\nI guess I don't really know exactly. Doing a PhD is very, very hard, even when it's a very positive experience (my case). And the hardships change, evolve over time. \n\nA lot of things are hard. In my opinion, the big question is not \"what is the hardest part?\" but \"For what parts you are not ready?\" For example, keeping mental health can be very hard, but maybe you're very prepared for that. A PhD will probably expose your weaknesses. If you're not good at writing, that will be hard for you. If you're not good at managing your time, that will be hard for you. If you're not good at understanding the theoretical background, that will be hard for you. If you're not good at dealing with conflicts with other people, that will hard for you. If you're not good at asking for help, that will be hard for you. If you're not good at doing things without any help, that will be hard for you. So, the hardships related to your Achilles' heel are the hardest part. \n\nIn my case, probably the hardest part is to know when to stop. There are always more things to do, there is always something to improve. And I'm a very hard worker. The constant feeling that there is more to do can easily lead to feelings that I haven't done enough, and that can easily make me work too much. So, I know I need to stop, take a break, slow down, take it easy sometimes. But identifying the moment to do that is very hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; How do you think your experience differed from traditional candidates? \n\nI don't know if there is such a thing as a \"traditional candidate.\" People are very different from each other. People say I'm very unique, but that's not because of my age. \n\nAnyway, I think my experience was helpful at knowing the problems that companies face in the real world. Because of that, my research questions tend to be more interesting and relevant than average, and when I teach classes the students really recognize I'm not like the typical professors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; What kinds of support helped you the most?\n\nHaving a good advisor that is a good match for you is critical. Doing a PhD is hard, and your relationship with your advisor can make the journey much more rewarding or completely awful. \n\nI don't think there is any specific kind of support that helped me the most. More important than that, is to have the feeling that people are there to support me if I need to. The small things matter a lot.

I struggled to be taken seriously because I didn't look 30.\n\nNow that I am tenure-track faculty, I still get the occasional \"excuse me, this area is for faculty only\" remarks from staff at my institution, which always makes me chuckle.\n\nOverall though, I would say it's more about how old you appear vs. your actual age. I'd say looking as if you're between 30 and 40 is a great spot to be in within academia. I'm still waiting to reach 25 in most people's eyes...\n\nEDIT: Case in point, my institution just hired a new asst. prof. who is easily in his late 40s/early 50s.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/r06xpl/is_there_less_ageism_in_academia_computer_science/hlr4ps4/"}, "4076": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "phdjourney", "Date": 1637664181, "Score": 1, "Body": "Study properly..ug.and pg ..then do phd...\ud83d\ude44", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/r01ctc/can_i_go_from_bachelors_straight_to_phd/hlr5ilk/"}, "4077": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AloneTrifle", "Date": 1637665712, "Score": 1, "Body": "ye since is started uni my astigmatism went from .25 to 1 which is uncommon but it happened so yea", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qztx0j/anyone_else_have_degrading_eyesight_after_joining/hlr7bzh/"}, "4078": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "cienfuegos__", "Date": 1637665926, "Score": 2, "Body": "In Australia you can progress from a Bachelors degree directly into a PhD as long your undergraduate degree had an Honours year (research thesis).\n\nAustralia has a solid culture of scholarships for PhD students, and  sure they'd have a special subset for international students.

The rest of this answer tried to explain why.\n\nDid your optometrist say the word \"far-sighted\" during your exam?\n\nNear-sighted people have trouble seeing far away because the optics of the eye causes things to be blurry, and glasses are prescribed to correct the optics. This happens most often in childhood or adolescence but some people don't get prescribed glasses until adulthood. Since the glasses are just correcting for optics, they have no effect on whether or not the eye continues to grow and the prescription \"gets worse.\"\n\nFar-sighted people also have optics of their eyes that would cause blurry vision, at distance and near, but they can overcome this by tapping into the eye's natural focusing ability. Most farsighted people go the majority of their lives without needing glasses, but the eye's focusing ability decreases with age, and so many farsighted people get their first pair of glasses as adults. The purpose of the glasses is to correct for the optics so the eye can relax and not focus so hard.\n\nMy husband is farsighted and got his first pair of glasses in his mid-20s. We (I was a student intern at the time) under-corrected him so that his eyes would still focus some but not as much, and his eyes could relax more (this is pretty common since people struggle with going straight to full relaxation). When he first got his glasses, he hated them because his eyes still wanted to focus, but after wearing them for some time, his eyes finally realized they could relax and his vision was clear through the glasses. Since his eyes are more relaxed with glasses, they don't want to focus as much anymore without them, so my husband relies on his glasses more, but that doesn't mean the glasses made his vision worse. ***I'm wondering if this is what you mean when you say you feel the glasses make your vision worse.*** He's actually noticed recently that his vision is getting blurry again - what I explained to him was that he likely needs more of that correction since we didn't give him full strength to begin with.\n\nIf you are also farsighted, your experience may be very similar to my husband's. You said it was pretty sudden - my guess would be with the natural decline with age, as well as the increased demand with your graduate work, your focusing system just pooped out and you immediately noticed the blurred vision.\n\nLong answer, but I hope it makes sense! Not sure if you're in science or humanities, so I tried to use some science and less science words. Don't hesitate to let me know if I can clarify anything.\n\nDisclaimer: my information does not replace a comprehensive eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

That lie needs to stop. \n\nWhen applying, I struggled defining myself as a scientist because I worked as an academic technician for 4 years in one field, a staff scientist for two years in another unrelated field in industry, and had no desire to pursue research in either field when I applied to grad school. My publication list at the time of applying was already in the double digits, and I was able to fill a 20 minute interview just talking about my own work. I had thought people were impressed, but I think my lack of focus had shone through, I don\u2019t know. I received an offer of admission at the one school I applied to very very late in the process.\n\n**Middle:** I was clearly a step ahead of people who were just coming out of undergrad. I had already worked for an extremely demanding young PI in Boston and was the driving force in the lab for them getting tenure. I chose an advisor whom I knew would offset my weaknesses. I was used to working a normal job, so while my cohort were enjoying some new found freedom to work when they pleased, I was working just As I had always been. \n\nI was very productive early on, and of course that\u2019s when your committee starts pressuring you to pursue academia. I had considered it briefly, but then realized a faculty position or even a highly competitive post doc position is a nationwide search and my wife and I had no desire to move, not after both of our families up and moved closer to us. \n\nMuch of what I had done in grad school I had already done in some form or another. My advisor apparently knows that getting reviews back on your first publication can be a tender time for humbled young grad students, so I think he was disappointed when I just shrugged them off and got to work on revisions. I had done this a few times already. \n\nThe hardest part in all of this was commuting. My wife was in med school an hour and a half away, so we lived about an hour from my grad school. When she matched residency at a different program, we attempted to live separately but both became extremely depressed so I moved to her and spent years 4/5/6 commuting 140 miles a day just to live with my wife. Not going to lie, it was rough. There were Saturdays when I would drive nearly 3 hours just to do 45 minutes of cell culture maintenance. There were many frustrated drives to and from the lab over the past 5.5 years. \n\nAnother thing older grad students don\u2019t talk about is that your families and friends begin to expect more of you. When I was age 22-26, my friends were all just starting out and had neither the time nor money to socialize or go on elaborate trips. Now, I feel like I have 2-3 weddings and bachelor parties per year, and my friends want to go on elaborate ski or golf or hunting outings - something I have neither the time nor the money for still. \n\nOur families also want to plan week long holiday get togethers and expect us to travel to them since we can\u2019t accommodate everyone in our 3 bedroom home. Over the years we\u2019ve disappointed our families dozens of times because my wife is working Christmas Day, or I have a huge experiment going on through the 4th of July holiday, or we skip thanksgiving (as we will do this year) because my wife is on night shift and no one is willing to wait and do Turkey day on Saturday. When we were younger, it was easier to just get up and go attend these things. Now we have kids, pets, and other commitments and it\u2019s become infinitely harder to satisfy all interested parties with our very limited time.\n\n**End:** I have (again) chosen hard mode. I am stay at home dad to my 3 month old while writing my dissertation. It\u2019s been\u2026interesting. I find that I am most productive at night when she\u2019s sleeping from 8PM until about 3AM. \n\nMy advisor is spinning multiple companies off of our work and is intent on hiring me. My old boss is interested in hiring me. Two grad students that graduated a few years ahead of me have asked for my resume to give to their hiring managers at their respective companies. Things are really looking up. I\u2019m not gonna lie, it was freaking tough. Not just grad school itself, but for me, already having established a life, adapting to the demands of both mine and my wife\u2019s career.

So in that semester I took 7 or 8 different high level classes at the same time, planned on passing them all on first try in the time span of 1 month and then be free to take on my summer-teaching job (well-paid and back then I definitly needed the money). \nWell pretty much the worst-case scenario happenend and I scored badly in the first (oral) exam where the professor was simply a dick (most people failed that exam and in hindsight I was lucky  to pass). Then I failed a hard exam which was a first for me at that point. This obviously threw me back. While I passed the rest and even passed the failed exam later in the semester on second try this obviously completly messed up my schedule. I was stressed the entire 2.5 month of exam phase and the last month had to work half the day and the rest of the day learn for my still upcoming 2 exams. \n\nThe last one was the course relevant for my PhD and I barely passed it as I had practically only 1.5 days left to learn for it. The professor offered me to fail this class and let me try some weeks later again. I told him that I am too stressed right now and just want to pass no matter what. At this point I was at the brink of mental breakdown.\n\nLong story short I passed all exams that semester but 3 with bad grades thus lowering my average grade significantly. (Bye bye summa cum laude...)\n\nWhen asked about the bad grades in the interview for my current position I just told the professor what happenend, i.e. that I overestimated my abilities. He understood it, especially considering that my other grades were really good and it was only that one \"black-out\" semester. \n\nTl;dr: Just explain the situation truthfully.

My advisor told him that was actually against university policy (I suspect this is true for many universities), he wouldn't listen. I ended up taking it up to the dean of the graduate school. Dean intervened and said he either follows university guidelines or is off my committee. Watching him backtrack was the most amazing moment of my academic career. \n\nLesson being it's important to know the person you're working with/for. Are they chill or will they fight you over it?

Not much to say here. For (ii), however, it means understanding and being aware of the fact that mistakes are all over academic work. They can be minor, they can be huge, they can be caused by inexperience or by pure bad faith. Regardless of the source, errors and mistakes happen all the times. Some require a correction note, some require retraction of the paper, while some others do not require anything because they don't impact the overall conclusion of the paper.

And with workshop, I mean a \"real, 3D\\*\" workshop, not on Coursera or anything. That kind of workshop where you first get some general tips and at the end of which you supply texts of your own and where a professional writing workshop person gives feedback so that you can improve your writing.\n\nDo you have that sort of workshop at your university? \"Writing in academia\", \"academic writing\" or something like that? I visited such a workshop at my university recently and it helped me a lot. Of course, I will not from one day to the next write the best articles, but at least I have some ideas at hand...\n\n\\&gt; I know that I don\u2019t read enough\n\nWhat stuff do you read normally in your own language? Do you read a lot of books (SciFi, Horror, whatever) or news articles?

Some questions to get you started:\n- Do you work better having a consistent working schedule or being flexible with your time and working when you feel like?\n- What time of day do you work best?\n- Do you prefer working on paper or using digital tools?\n- How can you get yourself to make progress? Personal deadlines? Accountability buddies? Working groups? Regular meetings with your advisor?\n- Where do you work best? Office, home, library, coffee shops, etc. Does a regular rotation help?\n\nTip 2: Have a brain dump in some form. A location where you can put all the tasks you need to track, random things that pop-up, thoughts etc. For me, a bullet journal in a pretty notebook.

Troubleshoot experiments by evaluating all combinations of the likely variables in one big experiment if it is reasonably affordable and you aren't sample/reagent limited.

I use to just put all my tasks into a single list and just tackle each item, then wonder why my list never got smaller and get frustrated because I'd procrastinate so much. Now, with Trello, each major project gets a page, each major task gets a card and each card is broken down into smaller, specific, concrete to-do tasks.

Don't focus on trying to always be at 100%, humans are rarely at 100% for a long period!

It's very unlikely that everyone will want to be there for 4.5 hours! Also, you're allowed to take breaks at any point. Will you be having an independent chair? If you do, it's their job to look out for your wellbeing and make sure you're getting breaks when you need them. \n\nYou have probably heard this before but YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOUR EXAMINERS!!! I know, I didn't believe it either (physics student in a maths department so definitely thought they would know more about the maths than me). Honestly, the examiners aren't testing you - they are asking questions because they are interested in your research and you are the expert. Repeat - YOU ARE THE EXPERT! They aren't going to ask you anything they already know the answer to, so they won't say you're 'wrong'. \n\nIn terms of questions, I can split the questions I got nicely into 3 groups. Group 1: Questions like 'what part are you most proud of?', 'what would you do if you had more time?'. Group 2: Questions that they asked and my immediate answer was 'I've answered that in Section...', and then they quickly moved on. Group 3: Questions where they either answered it themself while asking or where the other examiner answered - these questions were purely asked because they were interested in the research. \n\nAlso, it is perfectly okay to say that you don't know the answer. You can't know everything and that is completely okay. The viva is to check whether you wrote the thesis yourself, whether your thesis passes or not will have been decided before the exam. As long as you can show that you wrote it then you'll be absolutely fine.\n\nFinal piece of advice: Enjoy it!

Are you seeing a therapist (check with your school's counseling center for some support - at the very least get ON making an appointment as soon as the spring semester hits)? What does your day look like? What we know about depression is that it lessens with behavioral activation - AKA - Getting Shit Done. If you're not on meds, I can recommend some supplements that I've taken that have decreased my depression and anxiety, and have actually allowed me to get some good work done.

A form of pain you are lucky to feel. It means you're human, and not a raging narcissist like many academics. It is also a form of achievement pain most people never have the luck to feel: they are stuck in lives without hard dreams to achieve, riding the subway to an empty job in a factory boxing up Amazon orders, or driving a delivery truck, or sluicing meat through a chute, or slogging up toilet water or putting data into spreadsheets in a cubicle, because they had sex early and mouths to feed or otherwise suffer from this horrible world and its pitfalls. The PhD is your action, your dream, your mountain to climb. Precious thing you've got there, painful as it is. That's a lucky feeling of pain. Every time you begin to feel pain, depression, loneliness, have gratitude you are not having the other kind of pain: empty boredom of a dead-end job. If you feel the PhD is that dead end job, leave it.\n\nMotivation. Live in horror of the future version of yourself who failed to follow through with what you really believe in. If you do not believe in the PhD, leave it right now. Realize that a PhD must be somehow special, like an initiation into monkhood. Otherwise it's fake, and you will resent yourself for holding it. It's the choice to become a medieval monk and give up on many normal human parts of life in order that you might create something different of value. You are sacrificing time and humanity in order to bring something into the world. I keep my eye on the personal value I attach to my project: I believe it is something that ought to be done, that only I can do, and would be a damn shame if I did not complete it. Hell with the rest of the world. I move the world around my project. Even if it turns out to be disgusting offspring, the process of creating it will have changed me as well. It's big and important and takes all my time and focus, and I'm a complete nut and nobody will understand that. Hell with them too, they're boring people without any creativity. If you do not have that feeling of absorption, leave the PhD. You've no business doing it.\n\nBackground. If you're depressed, it can be a sign you should be here, not that you shouldn't. People who are rich and wealthy 2nd or 3rd generation trust fund babies and cruise through these programs without mental health struggles do not belong in academia. They're boring and should go sit on the beach or jump in a lake. You, on the other hand, are actually new and interesting. Realize you have a remarkably different world to bring to the PhD than almost anyone else. Insist upon it, tell people about it, craft it, develop your persona, make sure people know. Seek out a network of similar graduate students and build a community somehow. Get a part-time job somewhere casual and reconnect with your roots as a lowly commoner. Remember how wonderful and rich the real world is in comparison to academia. That's the only way I could survive as a working class person. Academia is a hazing process for rich children trying to tend their cute little hobbies into careers or impress their overdemanding parents. You need to do it because you're not that. Thank god you're not that. They should be depressed, not you.\n\nBody. Learn to love how good it feels to move, rush, dance, breathe, run. Fast intermittently. Get the toxic stuff out of you through sweat and breath once a day at least. You will think and work better in a fasted 'survival' state after around 14 hours as your body is burning what it has stored overnight. Sugars and carbs will bog you down and give you brain fog. Start the day with no calories, black coffee, and some apple cider vinegar mixed with sparkling water, maybe minimal proteins. Go outside and walk or jog and breathe the air. Renews and revives your mind and prepares for a productive day of writing, sitting, and thinking about infinite complexity. Wonderful and awful process.

I get it, it sucks and is frustrating that something that seems so easy to everybody else is so hard for us. But my take on it is: that\u2019s life. Nobody is perfect, everybody has their own mountains to climb, even if it\u2019s not worn on their sleeve the way ours at times can be. \n\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve heard before, if you\u2019re anything like me. It\u2019s not always helpful, but I still think it\u2019s true.\n\n\nBut probably, the single most important thing that has helped me is the absolute internalization of the idea that no one else really cares that much. Which, I\u2019m sure you know, is REALLY hard to do. To remove yourself from your ego like that takes a lot of effort. But it\u2019s possible. What I found was that when I accepted that others truly don\u2019t care about my stutter that I was caring about it less and less as well. It\u2019s still there, I still stutter most times I talk, but I just\u2026don\u2019t care as much as I used to. This creates a positive feedback loop where, because I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t psyche myself out before I even talk. I *expect* to stutter, because it\u2019s a part of who I am. But it doesn\u2019t define me. What defines me are the actual content of the words coming out of my mouth. So I focus on that. \n\n\nI\u2019ve already completed my Masters thesis presentation, which required me speaking for close to an hour non stop followed by a half hour of questions. I\u2019ll tell you what, I practiced the shit out of that presentation, went over every word again and again, and made sure I knew my stuff front and back. And it worked. Of course I stuttered during the presentation, but never badly, and never in a way that interrupted my flow. And that\u2019s my general plan for presentations from now on. You said yourself you get the highest grades and best research, so that\u2019s great! You have something going for you that the others don\u2019t. Focus on that positive aspect, rather than the negative aspect of your stutter.\n\n\nAnyways, I hope this could help. I still struggle with it too, but the thing is, we got this! Really, we do. We get one life, so we might as well spend it talking, even if it\u2019s hard. Hell, the fact that it\u2019s hard is probably the very reason why we should keep talking. Nothing worth having comes easy, after all, and getting a PhD with a stutter is certainly not easy.

The worst I've gotten was 'sometimes talks too fast' which is true and a valid critique that I do need to work on. \n\nThat said, it sounds like yours is more pronounced, so I totally understand why you hate it! The only real suggestion I have is maybe to focus less on your stammer and more on presenting with confidence, stammer or no. If you are going through a presentation and find that stammering makes you more self conscious, people are going to notice that more than if you just plow through. (Of course you should always make sure a thought is complete and clear and repeat yourself if necessary, rather than just go on to the next idea, but if your confidence takes a hit every time you stammer people will notice) \n\nI was in theater as a kid and even though presentations make me nervous, I had so much practice with projecting and posture etc that I never *seem* nervous. I'm frequently told I'm one of the best speakers in my program. I can't tell you how many seminars we all sit through where the speaker doesn't speak up, doesn't seem well rehearsed or like they know what they're saying next until the slide comes up, stands behind a computer so they're mostly hidden, rarely makes eye contact with the audience, speak in monotone the entire time, etc etc etc. None of these people ever stammer, but their presentations aren't *engaging*. I am the only person in my department who stammers (even if it is infrequent) but I'm a confident speaker nonetheless, and it shows. \n\nTldr: speaking with a stammer does not mean you don't speak well, and people getting through presentations easily doesn't mean their presentation is engaging for the audience.

Seems like a great fit for many grad students, right?\n\nWell, my advisor is UNIVERSALLY panned by other graduate students in the department. Students seeking rotations are told that my advisor is too hard on their students, that they are an \u201casshole\u201d for asking difficult questions during lab meetings, or for disagreeing with the conclusions made. They are told that they micromanage and that they set deadlines that are impossible to keep. \n\nI have, many times, taken a step back and tried to see it from a different perspective, that maybe I have some form of Stockholm syndrome, and I just dont see it. The graduate students in the lab have had great experiences, and even our newest graduate student who joined this year had no idea where all the stigma came from and was glad they ignored it.\n\nWe have very few students rotate, and my advisor actually likes it that way. I\u2019ve overheard conversations among first year students who don\u2019t know who I am discuss my lab and one of them was told by a senior grad student not in my lab \u201cno, just don\u2019t. Don\u2019t even bother rotating\u201d\n\nI know who these people are. They are my friends. They ALL have my advisor on their committee, because they bring good ideas to the table and have personally rescued an number of straying thesis projects. ALL of my friends tell me they don\u2019t know how I do it, how I deal with my advisor, and I as well as my labmates insist it\u2019s actually pretty easy and even enjoyable.
