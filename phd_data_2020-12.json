This will help you with research experience because presumably your proposal involved a research project and now you need to complete it and write it up.  It'll also keep you from getting 'distracted' because the things you're working on will also BE your thesis.  Bonus jonas: it's a lot easier to go into your defense if you know you have two things under peer review, even if they're not published yet!\n\nIt's not your committee's job to tell you what to do, so stop expecting them to it'll only drive you nutty. They're not your boss, and it sounds like your chair also doesn't feel like THEY'RE your boss, which means you're stuck being your own boss on this. That said, your committee HAS already approved your proposal and I guarantee you're not the only student they work with who has adapted their project due to COVID. There's probably a way to design a study that is somehow related but adapted for remote learning. Outline a proposal of an adapted project and run it by your chair, including milestones and timelines--see if they think that's good enough or if you should also discuss with your committee again.\n\nSeparately, I think what's really going on here is that you need to figure out the answers to 3 questions:\n\n1. What kind of jobs are you applying for, and what concrete skills and demonstrated experience do you need to get those jobs? You can change your mind on this later, but having at least one thing in mind will help give you structure when you're in the shapeless void of \"but I HAVE NO THESIS and I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TODAY\"\n2. What's your funding status? How long *can* you stay?\n3. What's your realistic status now? If you break your proposal (or your COVID-adapted proposal) down into that project management timeline, how long would it be before you have a) a PhD just any PhD and/or b) some additional research experience?  Would that be FASTER if you started over somewhere else (I bet you $20 the answer is \"no\")?\n\nIt sounds like you need structure and a light at the end of the tunnel, not to start over at year 5.  I believe in your ability to give yourself that structure. My guess is that even with all the hurdles you've faced, you probably *have* done and accomplished at least some stuff that you're discounting right now (otherwise your committee wouldn't be hurrying you along).

Even better, reach out to them! It sounds like maybe you want to be a professor--email those people and ask \"how do I get where you are\". Maybe it's \"realistically there are only 3 programs in the country where you've got a good shot of graduating and being on track to get a job like mine\".  Maybe it's \"do not expect this outcome if you follow my path, 90% of people with a PhD in my field actually do X\" (in which case...do you want to do X?).  Maybe it's \"you will do great, make sure you get x and y experience before you apply\".  But also, if/when those people don't respond, try again.\n\nAlso, general PhD advice: Do not pay for a PhD. Do not attend a program unless it has a good track record of matriculating students and placing them in good jobs, and keep in mind that even the \"best\" schools can fail to place *any* students in [professorships](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardvedder/2019/09/30/why-are-there-so-many-marginally-employed-phds-in-english/?sh=745b25301ab9).

Read them (articles and references), take notes, take how they use strategies, technics, ask your supervisor or advisor about that, attend conferences and courses to learn new notions. You can have an other co-supervisor, if you find someone is interested to your topic, why not a collaboration ?  by collaborations, you've opportunity to have more informations (50% of you and 50% of other phd students and supervisors). \nSecond Year, in this year you try to write out your papers (a thesis is a group of research papers), write your problem, why it is important for (your domain), how you treat it , what technics you have used, what results you have acheived it, make your first version paper and send it to your supervisor, disccuss it and compare it with other articles. \nThird year, it is reserved for publication and reviewing, when your papers got accepted  by a journal in order to publish it, then you are in step to write out your manscript (Thesis). \nIn your planing, make goals every month, every week and every day.\nFor example, this month, i will read this 3 articles , analyze them, take notes, understand strategy X, ask myself if this strategy works for my topic or not, examinate it, discuss it ... so every week, i will work a part of articles, i will learn how to programm by using Matlab or C++, and  every day is for your mini tasks (Thesis), your hobbies, distractions, personnal live, conferences, learning a specific language!!\nTo conclude, i advice you to make your own planing what you are confortable at it.

There are many valid reasons to have your work rejected. I recently had mine rejected in spite of being good due to the acceptance ratio (they already accepted enough good enough papers). \n\nIn some cases papers get rejected because the reviewers didn't understand the contribution of the paper. If the reviewers' comments sound like they're coming from idiots, the problem is most likely in the clarity of your writing (you didn't sell to idiots, google The Heilmeier Catechism). \n\nIn some cases the rejection is valid: you could've done a shabby literature review (like, you read only 30 papers in the topic, while you should've read at least 70; numbers vary between topics) that your work isn't really addressing a critical limitation they'd label your contribution as insignificant or minor (even though it's valid consistent work). You could've had good technical points, but it's out of context, or out of scope; isn't really tailored for the place it was submitted to. Or your work could be outright wrong. \n\nIn all cases, it's not a bad thing. You can always resubmit it, and the feedback you got will point out lots of weaknesses in your work. You should appreciate whatever feedback you got (no matter how assholic or high &amp; mighty it sounds) and not feel bad about it. It also tells you if your understanding, approach, method, solution, conclusion, observation, w/e, is flawed. Don't feel bad about it at all. \n\nDon't take it as a blow to your confidence. It does not mean you're an incapable researcher. You're still a capable researcher. It's not an attack, it's an opportunity to learn. Do NOT view it as a failure. Getting your paper rejected is not a failure at all.\n\nYour supervisor had rejections before. They (if they're not legit idiots, they exist) will not view your rejection negatively. They'll just tell you to submit it elsewhere. Just make sure to share your feelings and thoughts with them, that's important. Usually, the procedure is to address the reviews, fix the work, submit it elsewhere, and that's it. \n\nGetting rejected doesn't mean your paper below average. It is basically that your paper was perceived as such. It could be a really good paper, maybe not written well enough or ideas are not expressed properly, or the reviewers are ignorant of the topic and its out of their scope. There are a hundred reasons why a paper could get rejected even if it's an amazing piece of work. So, don't grieve yourself about a single rejection. Pull yourself by the bootstraps, review the comments and address them, and make a better version and submit it elsewhere. \n\nIf you intend to become an academic, then celebrate rejections; they boost your progress as one. Later on through your career your publications will be a lot better. \n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/k7job6/my_paper_just_got_rejected/gerw795/"}, "485": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Bloopbleepbloop2", "Date": 1607226997, "Score": 7, "Body": "Sorry to hear that!

I designed my presentation to be simple and direct. I wanted it to be somewhat accessible (is that the word?) to most people that would want to watch it.\n\nSince I didn't want it to be as boring as most academic presentations are, I invested my time in diagrams explaining concepts and experiments - and tried to not put equations, tables or lots of numbers. When talking about my results, I tried to keep it simple and point out my main findings without going through a lot of detail.\n\nMy advisors didn't quite like this approach and advised me to be more technical. They said something along the lines of \"nice Ted talk, no so nice thesis defense\". To be fair, they also said that it was their opinion based on the last defenses they attended to and that my style of presentation would be welcomed in other countries. So I tried to include more details, more equations and quantitative results, but I still didn't want to lose time with those slides during my defense. I wouldn't say that I rushed when presenting such details, but I'd briefly explain them and move on. Overall, I'd say that including equations and summarized tables improved my presentation and avoided a few questions in the end.   \n\nAnyway, this is just my experience. I learned that PhD defenses are really field specific. Nevertheless, try not to overthink it, keep practicing what you are going to say and kick ass during your presentation.

To be honest, one of my best friends father and grandmother just passed away due to complications with Covid. As a result, life was quite fast-paced and social media was not a priority (on top of the already stressful life of a researcher). \n\nNow in my case I started my ex-PhD last year in October (pre-Covid, this plays an \"important role\"). My field is the Biomedical Sciences, and because of this particular topic I had to invest a lot of time in the hospital. On the other hand, because we worked with hearing aids and implants, I also spent a bit of time in the Engineering Facility, completely out of the city where I live.\n\nThe first 4 months were quite smooth, I was working on my planning and doctoral research draft (overall what I would do in 4 years). I got this document accepted in February and proceeded to start ny intensive training. Then the pandemic got worse and lockdowns happened...\n\nMarch and April were stagnant (practical research wise), which was quite frustrating since I was literally about to get serious in the lab. The month of May arrived and I got clearance to slowly start my experiments, one day per week (at the hospital, but not the engineers cave). Now, by this time my supervisor was quite annoyed by the lack of results and pressed for it. Especially because we needed to request permission to work with small animals and in the long run propose a clinical trial. Both of this processes take a lot of time, mainly due to bureaucracy. However, the proposal was made in April, rejected once and resent by May. Unfortunately we never had an answer, at least positive. \n\nSkipping all the way to June, I worked in some prototypes at the Engineering Faculty once I finally had the permission to do so. Very slowly but surely, since the priorities were given to some professors and post-doctoral researchers. By this time, it was necessary to organize a First Year Evaluation. It was set by the 18th August. I was nervous since I had only 3 months worth of experiments to show. And, as I feared, the Committee basically pounded every single element of my research. Fine, I hear their complaints and improve wherever is possible.\n\nThe catch here is, not only complaints happened, also a threat to fire me. Because in a period of 9 months I only experimented for almost 3. Just remember there was a pandemic and no clearance so... The next month was hell, trying to justify myself and comments from my boss about how I don't fit the team. Too slow, not enough results, Covid wise doesn't matter.\n\n25th of September came. After a meeting with the relevant government authorities to explain how the money was spent and why are new facilities required (fancy new building just acquired some days prior). I was called by my boss. You are out. Not surprising but completely unpleasant and uncalled for. Not because I don't have professional weaknesses, but for the lack of a proper reason. The claim was \"the Committee made remarks about you, we do not want you in the team\". When asking for clarification, none was given. \n\nI had to return to my country, because visa was revoked. And now I look for opportunities in the medical imaging field (in the remote case someone has an offer \ud83d\ude02). Does not really matter where. \n\nThe most important point here is that a work environment can make or break the mold. Even if you are passionate about the field, they can still push you out. I will not give up, but I lost my job and visa because of this situation. \n\nFor whoever read all of this, thank you for your patience. \n\nPeace, \nJose Luis", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/k8cezd/im_changing_labs_in_my_3rd_year_genetics_phd/geygexh/"}, "607": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sleepietimenkw", "Date": 1607360540, "Score": 42, "Body": "Tara brabazon, the dean of postgraduate studies of flinders university, does these amazing YouTube videos on phds and academic life.

Adding Covid on top of that, and being at home all the time can make it a nightmare.\n\nIt took me about a year to actually start seeing where I was going with my PhD, and the beginning is often quite fuzzy (depends on your subject). I've definitely been working on a weird rhythm since the lockdown hit, and I've had a hard time sticking to a schedule and really feeling productive, so don't feel bad about that!\n\nI know what it feels like to not be able to concentrate when you work, and to feel guilty when you are not working. It's absolute hell, and it sums up most of my PhD, it's just a learning process.\n\nWhat you should do is start small. You probably have this expectation of reading 6 papers a day, and running several simulations, and actively working 40 hours a week on your PhD. There are some stages where it just won't be the case. At times you'll work 12 hours a day, because something needs to get done, and at other times you'll only get 2 hours of productive work a day. When I'm in phases where I really don't feel productive, that's what I aim for: 2 hours of productive work in a day. I know that SOMETHING gets done, so I don't feel too guilty, but at the same time, I know that pushing against that anxiety too much and expecting too much of myself will simply lead to more frustration.\n\nIf you can, try to build a routine for yourself. That is, doing the same things in the morning, and before you start working. I find that, especially in these times, having some time to workout really helps. Helps you get your stress level downs and maintain your physical as well as mental health. Try to eat healthy as well. Can't really feel good and do good work if you just snack here and there on bad foods. Set yourself a \"max wake up time\" that you will not exceed. Say it's 10AM. Regardless of what happens, you will NOT snooze past 10AM. It's easy to slowly drift away every say and start waking up after noon and feel even worse about yourself.\n\nOnce all of this is set, you can try to stick to 2 hours of productive work in a day (or less if you need to start with less). Tell yourself: I'll read this one paper this morning, and run a simulation and get the results this afternoon. Or do everything in a row and have the rest of the day to yourself. When you do that several days in a row, you'll get to the end of the week, and you'll realize \"It adds up\". Even a 10 hour work week, if it's 10 productive hours, can get you quite a bit of results. You can then work a bit more from there, and once you get past that bad phase in the cycle, and maybe get more opportunities, external motivations, clearly defined goal, good meetings with your supervisors, new ideas, you'll see that you might even have trouble doing anything OTHER than your PhD!\n\nIt's definitely very difficult because you need a lot of accountability and discipline, but you also have to be flexible with yourself, and understand how YOU work. The way you work or your mind works is completely different from the next person. So, good habits, routine, exercise, healthy eating, lower expectations at first, and short but manageable tasks.

First off, your GRE/TOEFL scores are great and will get your foot in the door anywhere you apply. However, you're going to have to do it differently than a more traditional candidate. The reason I got in is because I reached out to a number of different schools and directly talked to faculty before admissions. There are faculty that will absolutely be interested in you, because work experience is valuable and you gain all sorts of soft skills that many other applicants may not have. \n\nIn terms of the programs that you apply to, I would absolutely have a couple of 'reach' schools, top-10 programs. For ECE, I'm guessing that would be the MIT/Stanford/Georgia Tech's of the world. Applicants to these programs typically have research experience (on top of being academic superstars), so don't get your hopes *too* high. Your sweet spot is universities in the 15-50 range. I don't know which universities both fall into that category and do quantum computing/SSD work, but you should be doing plenty of investigation into research groups. I would recommend looking at recent NSF CAREER awards - this indicates the faculty member is relatively new, high performing, and still building their research group.

My advice only applies if you\u2019re a US citizen at a US university. \n\nMost programs pay for their students\u2019s stipends from a training grant. In this case, you will receive the full $30,000/year ($2,500/month), and it will be up to you to pay taxes. I think you can safely assume 12% in taxes, but I always saved 15%. So for a $2,500 monthly check, set aside $375 (note: this is not legal advice. Seek advice from a tax professional). Technically, you should pay quarterly taxes. Every three months, send in 15% of your stipend, $1,125. Alternatively, you can pay it all at once, but you\u2019ll have a small penalty for not paying quarterly. \n\nThings become a lot easier once you\u2019re in a lab/department. If you\u2019re paid through a department, you will be taxed as an employee, so ~15% of your monthly pay will be withheld. At that point, you don\u2019t have to worry about setting money aside.

However, a 27-year-old letter doing rounds on the internet reveals that his award-winning study on cells and their adaptability to oxygen, was rejected for publication by a science journal in 1992.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the letter dated August 5, 1992, Dr Rory Howlett, the-then associate editor at *Nature*, had written to Ratcliffe informing him of the journal\u2019s decision to not publish his study after comments by two reviewers. \u201cGiven the discrepancy mentioned by reviewer 1, we have sadly concluded, on balance, that your paper would be better placed in a more specialised journal, particularly given the competition for space,\u201d it said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Announcing the prize at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm on Monday, the Nobel committee said that the trio's discoveries on the mechanism cells use to respond to change in oxygen levels or hypoxia, have paved the way for \"promising new strategies to fight anaemia, cancer and many other diseases.\" The importance of oxygen has long been established, the committee explained, but how cells adapt to changes in its levels remained unknown.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But, back in the 1992, the reviewers for *Nature* were unable to comprehend the \u201cmechanisms of genetic response to hypoxia\u201d that Ratcliffe had proposed. It led them to conclude that the study was unfit for publication as the direction of research was something which was beyond their understanding -- a reminder that science builds itself over time, and discoveries that transform our understanding are not instantly apparent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Noting this, *Nature*, in its congratulatory announcement for the prize observed, \"Over the years, the pioneering research helped pave way towards a plethora of medications that target this pathway.\"\u200b  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is not the first time that a Nobel laureate's study or research was initially rejected. Among notable names is Peter Higgs who proposed the Higgs model. His short paper describing the study was rejected by the journal Physics Letters in 1964. He went on to win the Nobel in 2013.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Similarly, the work of Rosalyn Yallow, who won the Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1977, was rejected by The Journal of Clinical Investigation. Her research on radioimmunoassay \u2013 a common technique used for determining antibody levels in the body \u2013 was believed to be lacking grounding by the reviewers of the journal.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kau0j5/rejection/gfd0opr/"}, "1120": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "veryshanetoday", "Date": 1607661974, "Score": 14, "Body": "Honestly, everyone gets horrible rejections like that.

I have had many panic attacks that I could have avoided if I'd just forced myself to eat some crackers and cheese, or if I hadn't've had that last cup of coffee. Of course, I recognize that these options aren't equally available to everyone etc., but you should do what you can to reduce the physical causes and symptoms of anxiety.\n\nHere's the psychological trick that helped me more than anything: by mid-April, I had been rejected from 6 schools and was on 2 waitlists. I began to conclude that I wasn't going to get in anywhere at all. That was a very painful thing to go through, but it made me start to imagine futures for myself beyond the academy. I ended up formulating a clear plan for what I was going to do when I got the final rejection letter: how I was going to set and achieve creative and intellectual goals, how to continue paying the rent. I ended up actually kind of excited to get those last rejections, because I had other exciting plans to look forward to.\n\nThe bigger point that I'd encourage you to realize is this: a PhD program is not the only route to a successful, creative, engaging life. Academia is not the only place where you can do interesting work. And a rejection from a PhD program with a cohort size of 5 or 6 and an application pool of 200 does not reflect on your personal worth at all. Plenty of people who are qualified don't get in for no good reason. As a friend of mine put it: PhD admissions are like gambling without the fun.\n\nI think that coming up with an idea of what a good life can be outside of the academy is a way to prove to yourself that, even if you don't get in, life will still be worth living. You'll still be a creative, intellectual person, and you will still have opportunities to engage in intellectual discourse. So much of the anxiety, for me, was that the stakes for the application season felt life-or-death: if I didn't get in, I was a failure, a disappointment, etc. etc. When you hear those voices, remember that these things aren't true; it's the anxiety talking. If you don't get in, you're a smart, capable person who happened to have a bad admissions season. (And if you do get in, yay!!)\n\nThese feelings are different for everyone, so I don't know if these thoughts are at all helpful for you. But I hope they are, and I wish you the best of luck during this season!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kawj1w/humanities_phd_admission/gfetcbl/"}, "1196": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "93PercentSodiumAzide", "Date": 1607707455, "Score": 6, "Body": "Google scholar your field and interesting research.

Your interviewers will be picturing themselves as your future boss or colleague, how you talk about past co-workers and bosses will be how they think you will talk about them.\n\nHope this helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kco2af/advice_i_just_got_an_interview_for_my_phd/gfrxycj/"}, "1509": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Yanna_of_the_Forest", "Date": 1607916674, "Score": 2, "Body": "I\u2019m not in your field, but to fill time: relax, enjoy a quick break, read interesting scientific papers you can discuss with interviewers.\nI recommend the podcasts: Science Friday, RadioLab, and Freakonomics, and Planet Money", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kchh7s/just_submitted_my_applications_now_what/gfrydf2/"}, "1510": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "melcici23", "Date": 1607916850, "Score": 11, "Body": "I am PhD student and I am teaching, meet my students.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kcmufz/student_is_asking_for_a_c_on_final_grade_after/gfryotq/"}, "1511": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "steppponme", "Date": 1607916925, "Score": -13, "Body": "\"student\" could be a PhD student but I'm assuming you mean undergrad.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kcmufz/student_is_asking_for_a_c_on_final_grade_after/gfrytop/"}, "1512": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "melcici23", "Date": 1607916927, "Score": 83, "Body": "Filing the report right now.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kcmufz/student_is_asking_for_a_c_on_final_grade_after/gfryttj/"}, "1513": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "melcici23", "Date": 1607916945, "Score": 35, "Body": "Desperate too", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kcmufz/student_is_asking_for_a_c_on_final_grade_after/gfryuyh/"}, "1514": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "melcici23", "Date": 1607917019, "Score": 45, "Body": "Yea, gonna fail him, plus it\u2019s the violation of academic integrity according to school rules, filing the report", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kcmufz/student_is_asking_for_a_c_on_final_grade_after/gfryznz/"}, "1515": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "melcici23", "Date": 1607917138, "Score": 56, "Body": "Yes, def!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kcmufz/student_is_asking_for_a_c_on_final_grade_after/gfrz760/"}, "1516": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "melcici23", "Date": 1607917235, "Score": 8, "Body": "Actually a grad school student... but...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kcmufz/student_is_asking_for_a_c_on_final_grade_after/gfrzd4t/"}, "1517": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Spotted6leggeddog", "Date": 1607917620, "Score": 1, "Body": "I\u2019m hoping to push a few papers to out.

I didn't say all PhDs are easy. I didn't say that no one is struggling from the beginning. I just said not everyone is struggling.\n\n&gt; some of your comments come off like you are invalidating or at the very least questioning other people\u2019s experiences.\n\nIf that's the case, it's a reactionary response to people literally saying the exact to me except far more explicitly.\n\n&gt; A plausible TLDR of your post is \u201cI don\u2019t know why y\u2019all complain so much, I\u2019m thriving, you must be doing it wrong\u201d.\n\nThis helps me understand where a lot of the negative comments are coming from. Thank you for trying to explain it, I really appreciate it. \n\nAt the same time, I genuinely don't see how you can construct that meaning? You'd have to go looking for it. If you just take what I'm saying at face value, I'm very clearly not passing judgement. This is a post about MY experience with a bit of bad humor mixed in.\n\nI even went out of my way in each point to acknowledge how someone having a hard time might feel. I'm very clearly not saying \"you're doing it wrong\". If you read it that way, I think you came into the post expecting to read that, and then that colored how you read everything I said. \n\nIf you were to read it without the impression I'm passing judgement, I don't think you could see judgement there. Especially considering several others didn't see judgement, so this \"deeper meaning\" clearly isn't a consistent theme. I think this is in the eye of the reader, not the author...\n\n&gt; People sometimes need to vent and commiserate.\n\nOh absolutely, and my comments talking about the negativity on this sub have mentioned this very point: \"I understand that this sub is a great place to vent **because it is filled with people who understand the difficulty**\". \n\nBut think of this from my perspective for a second. I see a lot of posts from new PhDs saying \"I just started and this sucks\". I wanted to provide a counterpoint, saying the exact opposite. And I think I made the purpose pretty clear at the end, that this **might** be the experience of some who are starting soon.\n\n&gt; I find a lot of support, perspective and helpful suggestions in this community.\n\nAgreed. I'm glad this community exists to vent to. Especially because we need a community of people who understand.\n\nBut based on the comments I got, it feels like you have to suffer in order to be welcome in the community. If I say, \"hey, I'm doing alright\", the default response of many seems to be \"no you aren't, you're wrong\". Like it's not welcome to share successes or positivity, that this sub is **only** for venting and pessimism.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kczlf2/first_6_weeks_of_my_phd_expectations_vs_reality/gfw02s8/"}, "1709": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Simple-Echidna-6157", "Date": 1608005562, "Score": 4, "Body": "Just remember that its the quality not the quantity!

Economics rely much more on algebra, calculus, and abstract concepts, while business is much more empirical. So, business classes tend to be discounted in economics. \n\nIf you need a reference, we used books like Statistical Inference, by Casella and Berger, which are a bunch of equations not connected to an empirical setting or coding.

Based on what you describe - I think it's healthier for you limit communication with your mother and set boundaries with her (e.g. topics off limits) and if she doesn't respect that then you end the conversation. This is NOT being disrespectful to your mother.  It is being respectful to yourself. \n\nI know it's easier to say than to do it but your number priority should be your health, not pleasing your mother. Trust me, I know where you're coming from and that type of mentality (my mom is the same) but your mother wants you do a PhD for all the wrong reasons - it has nothing to do with her lacking education.  It's probably so she can say to her friends my daughter has a PhD, probably to compete with others.  There are some types of people who can never be pleased.  Even after you get a PhD, I wouldn't be surprised if you mother was on your case about something else, laying guilt trips, etc.  \n\nIt is on YOU to change the dynamic of the relationship you want and involves setting boundaries. If you keep obeying your mother she has no reason to change herself because she has all the power and control over the relationship - you have given all your personal power to her (by that I mean respecting yourself, doing what's best for you).  She's not doing this intentionally - much of ego-based behaviour is unconscious. YOU need to change the \"dance\" if you want any type of peace. Your mom will eventually adapt to this change - it won't be easy for either one of you and she will throw tantrums and lay guilt-trips but you have to stick with what's best for you. Eventually she will come around or risk losing you, most parents don't want to take that risk.\n\nFrom everything you describe, I think you're going to be so much worse off if you keep trying to pursue a PhD.  You can be successful without a PhD - most people don't have a PhD.

I assume you haven't done any of the data collecting yet in Germany because of Covid, and that most of the work you have done has been in preparation for that? Is there any way you may be able to a very similar project but at a museum in the US instead of Germany? That way you might be able to simply reuse the work (or at least some of it) you already did and reframe it for the new situation. I would suggest you find a way to repurpose at least some of the work you have done already so it isn't totally lost, and so you can get started quickly on the new subject. A new subject doesn't necessarily have to mean losing large amounts of time (I had to pivot my subject in the first year of starting to work on it myself, but I could still use mist of the preparatory work I had already done, so it wasn't all useless). But again, it really depends on your subject and the work you have already done.\n\nI get that this sucks, but unfortunately, the current pandemic has meant changing directions for a lot of us. We have to work with what we can, and if your data is simply unavailable right now, you don't really have many options unfortunately. I've had to include the phrase \"Unfortunately, this data is incomplete because the global COVID-19 pandemic has prohibited data collection\" (or something like that), and I'm sure I'm not the only one. For me it was not a vital element that was missing, and I had enough other data that it was fine, so I was lucky. But you seem to be still in the early stages, and I guess that means that you're \"lucky\" enough that you can still adjust your research.\n\nAll that to say that my main advice is: try not to dwell too much on what was lost and what could have been, there is no way to change the current situation. Your options are to either wait and hope the world goes back to normal soon (knowing that this will most likely result in you finishing later than intended), or pivot your research to topic that is doable now, and try to find a way to do it so that the work you already put in was not totally in vain. Talk to your supervisor about your options.

He was so obsessed with publishing an original study that he forced me to work on a subject that never interested me, only because it was an area that hasn't been studied before by others. His weekly expectation from me was showing progress on my project, reading at least two papers and giving presentations about the papers and the project. He wanted me to publish at least one paper in a good venue by the end of the semester. Forced me to finish some online courses and got angry for I was spending time on my actual courses. Just like your situation, we had meetings several times a week including weekends, thanksgiving break, fall break, etc. He said he wouldn't fund me next semester because he found better students than me. After that he kept expecting me to do the same things as if that talk didn't happen. So I'm switching to being a teaching assistant next semester and I will search for a better group for myself. I haven't heard from my PI since I told him about this. I think he got very angry with me. But since then I feel incredibly free.

If it's to discuss graduate school, go talk to your own school's advisors. You don't get into PhD programs by being buddy buddy with a professor, you get in on the merits of your application. So if that's what you're seeking, focus on making your application to the school she works at the strongest as possible.\n\n&gt;now that i read like 200 pages of her work, i feel like i should be able to get a response, right?\n\nNo, you're not entitled to her time. Professors are extremely busy, working anywhere from 60-80 hours a week. They have to teach their own classes for grads and undergrads, be available for office hours for their students, serve on thesis and dissertation committees for undergrads and grads, manage their department, all the while still finding time to actively progress their own research and publish.

I've seen many conference halls filled with people looking at their phones / doing something unrelated on their computers.\n\nIt sounds like you don't like conferences in general and that's the key reason they get on your nerves (which, fair enough, but that's not the conferences fault necessarily).

But there are proper channels to do this. If you know what lab she works in, and look up and see if there are any openings available that you can apply to. If so, great, apply and hope you get in! If not, send her an email ONCE introducing yourself, telling her that you admire her work, and asking if she has any job availabilities in her lab. And then simply wait for her to respond.\n\n&gt;so, in my previous emails, i wrote very very long detailed examples of specifics of her paper i liked, and was curious/confused about (like 1k words).\n\nThe problem with your current approach is that this comes off as arrogant and self-entitled. Don't take this the wrong way, I want to help you and I'm happy to help, but it's important to understand how certain actions can be perceived. First of all, 1000 words is an absurd length for an email--she will never read that. That's a 5 page double spaced paper sent by an unsolicited admirer with whom she has zero familiarity. Second, what makes you think she's interested in your critiques / commentaries on her paper? She receives all of that and more from her colleagues and other academics, whose commentaries and analysis are certainly more substantive than yours (truly don't take offense that: it's just a simple fact that people with PhDs in their fields understand the subject matter than mere undergraduates). Finally, sending more than 1 email--ESPECIALLY if they're all ~1000 words--is obnoxious, pestering, and generally not a good look [caps added for emphasis]. \n\n&gt;and am fairly convinced that I'd rather learn from her than other prof i'm currently looking at\n\nWhy do you take this to be true? Have you approached your current professor about your admiration for the type of work the other prof does? Maybe your current prof is just as knowledgeable or just as willing to help you realize whatever style of work you want to do as much as the prof you admire. You should always make the most out of the advantages conferred to you by your current situation rather than siphoning off your current relationships for newer ones.\n\n&gt;what You would do if u were in my position?\n\nSo to recapitulate, apply for an opening if there is one, if not send one email introducing yourself and asking to be considered for a position there if one opens up. Make it short, sweet, and polite, and most definitely do not pester with multiple long emails asking to join her lab. Working in her lab is a privilege--she doesn't owe you anything just because you've read her work and you admire her. Tbh, I'm sure a lot of people admire her, and the ones working with her probably consider themselves to be extra lucky. Academia is a hard field to make it in, so pretty much anyone who is successful in it is admirable to a lot of people. In the meantime, so everything you can to go to grad school where she works so she can be your dissertation advisor.\n\nHope this helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kewfqw/advice_on_approaching_profs_for_grad_school/gg5l8fo/"}, "2061": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "chengstark", "Date": 1608223260, "Score": 8, "Body": "Nope, virtual for me actually resulted in a higher interaction rate", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kexx5z/virtual_conferences_are_bs_and_a_waste_of_time/gg5ljor/"}, "2062": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lionofyhwh", "Date": 1608223549, "Score": 5, "Body": "Also a very good point.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kexx5z/virtual_conferences_are_bs_and_a_waste_of_time/gg5m51t/"}, "2063": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ThePhysicistIsIn", "Date": 1608223615, "Score": 7, "Body": "You misunderstand the point of conferences.

We often fail to obtain the results we expected, we often fail to publish papers, etc. So, learning to face defeat and then rising to fight again is critical. We cannot let fear of defeat stop us from trying. \n\nThink about how many failures people researching a COVID-19 vaccine had to face until they started to get somewhere. Or how many failures people researching cancer have been facing for decades, including many of the best minds in the world. Chances of being defeated are much, much higher than chances of victory. But the few and small victories can be worth so much. \n\nBeing defeated helped me to see my own limits in a way I had never been able before. And being victorious helped me to see where my real strengths are, and what my place in academia and research can be. No one can win at everything. But you will be tested at many different things during a PhD. \n\nSo, yeah, we can vent a lot. Because it's hard, it's stressful, it's painful, like good fights usually are. Even when we enjoy the fight, it's still a hard fight. Even when we win, we remember that punch to our faces and we feel the pain. \n\nBut I think that good PhD programs will not only defeat you, break you down. They will also help you to grow from that, they will teach you the value of defeat, they will teach you to handle defeat, and how to turn that into victories. They will also teach you the value of collaboration. If you are always successful, you don't really need anyone else. But when you are defeated, you really appreciate people who can support you, who can do the things you are not able to do.

Sometimes precisely how that looks changes with the day, but I just try to seek. That's all. Caring too much about what other people think is a huge defect of mine. At the end of the day, I have no control over it; so to even really ponder the thoughts of others is futile. So long as I'm on the path that rings true to my heart then I am fine, and I hope you can feel fine too.\n\nI'm nowhere near my PhD yet. I read this subreddit for insight into what I can expect, maybe a few cheat codes to the whole thing, and inspiration. Today you provided me with the the last.

Above all, try to cling tightly to those who care about you (family, loved ones, etc). It\u2019s a long and challenging road, but it does get better.

I've taken a truly circuitous path to arrive where I am -- undergrad out of high school, returning for an undergrad and grad in a different field several years later, and now pursuing a PhD in my 50's in a field that has always fascinated me. I would be lying if I said I don't have ANY regrets, but the path has also been an asset in numerous ways. There are times I wish I'd gone straight into my current field, undergrad and grad, out of high school.

If possible, don't worry too much about your feelings of anxiety and imposter syndrome. Most people feel this way at some point(s) in academia. You are not an imposter! Most of us are anxious! Working through these feelings alongside the rigors of research will challenge you, and if you can persist, will help you grow as a person.\n\n1. Questions to consider: in the course of your life, what do you expect will bring you more happiness? Harmony with your parents' wishes? Or pursuit of your personal interests? Given your personality and life circumstance, would not choosing one of these paths cause you strong feelings of regret? Is it possible these two choices are not opposed, and you can convince your parents you are on track for a good life and pursuing something personally rewarding? \\[see #4, where you have a clear plan for where you want to go and why the PhD will help\\]\n2. I am sure it will be a bit scary and uncomfortable to be in a totally new place by yourself. When the pandemic allows, I would recommend trying to engage with the new country in as many ways as possible (in a manner that balances safety and getting a little outside your comfort zone). Explore the historic centers, try new cafes, join a hiking group or club to start making friends and experience new things. Discomfort can be transformed into wisdom if you are able to cultivate an attitude of \"this is an opportunity to grow\". When you feel homesick and lonely, do not try to banish the feeling, just sit with it and be curious about it the sensations and thoughts attached to it. Ask the questions: is there another way I can view this experience I am currently having? Is there anything available to learn from this experience?\n3. It's good you're thinking about the financial implications. Being broke temporarily is probably worth it if this program sets you on a career path that you will truly enjoy (noting especially that you do not like your current job). Does \"fully funded\" include a stipend? Going into debt vs. subsisting on a low income affect the equation of whether or not it's worth it to pursue.\n4. It really depends on what you want to do. What sort of job are you striving for? If it's a research position, then a PhD makes sense and the time you spend there will be the most relevant kind of work experience. I am not sure what the backgrounds are of people who work at the WTO, but it's possible the position you are striving for may not even require or be much advantaged by a PhD. It might be helpful to identify certain mid-career people in your field whom you admire, to look at their resumes and public profiles, and if possible, to speak with them and get a sense of what's needed.\n5. Yep, partnerships in academia are tough. If both of you plan to be academics of some sort, it is likely to involve some periods of long distance or sacrificing employment opportunities for your partner or vice versa, though you could get lucky and both get positions of your dreams in the same location. If you want to be together, ask him to apply for positions near you in Europe. If he declines, that is a data point about his priorities that will inform your long term compatibility. Distance relationships are tough but doable for some, or you can recognize your priorities aren't quite aligned and go your separate ways.\n\nGood luck! Be kind with yourself.

It's generic in the sense that the impact of social media on western democracies can fill entire libraries. Tinker around with the grammar of your thesis question, for example, changing it from a 'how' question to a 'what' question (i.e. 'what are the impacts...' instead of 'how does it impact...'). It wont necessarily be eye opening, but it will allow you to mature your own project. Methodological questions are also useful for this - are you hoping to get into quantitative research? Do you envision any statistical work on your project? Or do you want to do a qualitative project that, for example, feeds from different disciplines ('multidisciplinary')?\n\nAll of this being said - dont worry too much. My proposal quite literally pitched the complete opposite of what my final dissertation argurd, and I am convinced that this flexibility is key.

So, it was hard to follow some content, compared to people who studied that recently.\n\nOn a positive side, that experience is valuable when I'm teaching (I can use my own professional experience, and that's good) and sometimes for research (it's easier for me to identify relevant topics).\n\nBut doing research is quite different from working in industry in many ways, so it's good to be prepared for that.\n\nWhen you have a corporate job, you usually know the problem, and then you apply the knowledge and experience that you have to solve the problem as fast as you can, even if the solution is far from perfect and would only apply to that specific case.\n\nWhen you do research, finding the problem is often a challenge by itself. Many of your research ideas will be discarded, for many different reasons. And then, you need to develop a much deeper knowledge around that problem. Something that can involve theories and methods from very different fields of study, things you are not familiar with. And then you need to create new knowledge, and this is very different from learning existing knowledge. Maybe you love learning, you love reading research papers, things that already exist.

But I still harbored a lot of negativity (such as severe anxiety and imposter syndrome) from my first year. I felt like I was unable to accomplish anything. However, I was able to get on my department\u2019s training grant! And several weeks ago, after many failed experiments and tough classes, I had a long overdue talk with my advisor about my past struggles, and he told me that he believes in me and that I do deserve to be here. And that was something I really, really needed to hear. He let me go on an early break so I can do the things I love and get my mind off of toxic situations. During this break, I managed to get my name on a paper (a review, sure, but it\u2019s the first paper I\u2019ve ever participated in!). \n\nWhile this story isn\u2019t necessarily the most extreme \u201cout of the darkness and into the rainbows and sunshine\u201d story and it\u2019s still a work-in-progress, I found it\u2019s the little things that matter, too. :) \n\nI know this first semester must\u2019ve been especially rough with the pandemic going on as well.

On the other hand, submitting to a new journal will begin the whole peer review process again.\n\nThere are some ways to make things easier, since you mention that 30 days are insufficient for revising. One point was already made in another comment here - Tackle the simple reviews first. This will provide you some confidence and the motivation needed to get the job done. Next, jot down the most time-consuming reviews and set aside a good number of days to tackle these. On a good day, when you're feeling pumped up and creative, you may even be able to get done with most of it right away. What I've realized over my PhD program is that a positive mindset can make a huge difference in the way we work! Similarly, when I'm feeling moody or upset about some other issues, I just take some time off to let my mind rest.\n\nLastly, I also want to point out something that you may already be aware of. You don't have to address every single review! In fact, reviewers may get it wrong too. They may not have read your manuscript clearly enough or they misinterpreted some part of your work. You can resolve this by countering the review, and providing a good justification for why the review is wrong (or your work is valid). This could be either a theoretical proof or some experimental results, depending on your field of work. Just make sure to include this in your response to the reviews.\n\nAnd yes, publishing a journal paper every semester is ridiculously tough, and probably will kill your passion for the subject.

Your program seems extra shitty. Tons of people fail at things and you don't even know about it, because they live the rest of their lives and are happy. Focusing on these questions won't help you get closure. It will just prolong your suffering.\n\nBeing in a Phd program is a lot like joining a pyramid scheme. One of the things that they have in common is that people who are higher up the rungs (and profiting directly off of your work) tell you repeatedly that if you work hard enough, you can get where they are.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of people who join a multi- level marketing scheme don't make money. Like, 98% or something. And when they don't, they are told that it was because of something that they did. They didn't work hard enough, attend enough seminars, sacrifice enough. But that's not the truth. The truth is that they entered into a system that was not set up for them to succeed. \n\nNow considered, if you think about all the research assistants, and all of the graduate students, how many people who enter academia and get involved in research end up tenured? It's a very low percent. And the ones that get there have a lot of things that go right for them.\n\nI always think of the advisor relationship like being born into a family. Sometimes, kids are born with good parents, who have good habits, and can teach them how to survive the adult world. They teach them how to do chores, how to deal with other people, how to deal with emotions, how to manage money, and how to get jobs. then, when those people leave their family they are able to be successful adults. Other kids are born with parents who are neglectful, or themselves incompetent. Those kids simply do not get the same \"recipe book\" with different habits and lessons for success. They have to do their own crash course for every single thing that they learn. Even the most resilient kid would struggle with this, because it's just so much more time-consuming and difficult to learn things without good guidance. As an adult, I don't look at kids who are born with neglectful parents, and blame them for the fact that they can't read. You were born into an advisor family with parents that sucked. And yeah, theoretically you could have overcome that. Theoretically, you could have found out all these things that there was no way for you to find out. Theoretically, you could have out-worked it. \n\nOr, you are just buying into the myth. The myth that if you failed to make the big bucks in a pyramid scheme, it's that you didn't work hard enough. The myth that if you are born into poverty with neglectful parents, you could definitely have pulled yourself up by the bootstraps and become a billionaire by the age of 30 if you just believed in yourself and worked hard. \n\nOne of the biggest signs of a broken system is the emphasis on the personal responsibility of the people in it who have the least power. These are the people who ultimately end up as a victims.\n\nHint: You were playing a rigged game. The house almost always wins, unless a lot of things go right for you. Different PhD programs are different, and different advisors are different. Sometimes, no matter how competent, smart, capable, and hard-working you are, you CANNOT outwork the circumstances.\n\nAsking why will only get you stuck. Forgive yourself and love yourself. Tons of people fail all the time at stuff. Many have gone before you, and things have turned out fine.\n\nFigure out what you have succeeded at, and what types of environments you do well in. Figure out which types of environments you do not do well in. And focus on vetting new environments that you enter very carefully so that you don't end up in a situation like this again.\n\nYou're not a failure. You ended up in a program that was simply not the right fit for you. Which, it sounds like may largely be because it was shitty in general. And also academia is shitty in general. It's like somebody designed an intervention to target human weaknesses in a way that makes them miserable, and made it into an institution. It's kind of like a cult. The people in it insist that it is great, but a lot of evidence points otherwise.\n\nThis is easier said than done, but you have to let these questions (was it me or the program?) go.\n\nYou will never get the closure you seek this way, no matter how many times you ask. You will only get closure once you move on to the next stage of your life, and have some distance to look back.

Will help you network, get funding etc. and help you if you're stuck or in trouble\n\n* They care about their team members in general\n\n* They neither abandon nor micromanage their people\n\n\nGood characteristics for PhD students:\n\n* Be well organized: notes, time planning, prioritizing tasks\n\n* Resourcefulness: the ability to work out problems on your own or at least figure our who can help you best is very valuable\n\n* Social skills: Getting along well with peers you can rely on for advice will help you to be much more efficient. Don't waste time on reinventing the wheel, be a team player.\n\n* Good communication skills are priceless. Learn how to communicate your needs and expectations. Same for navigating conflicts. \n\n* Know yourself. Understand your desires, priorities, strengths, your weaknesses. Also be aware how your behavior may influence those around you. People react to your behavior as much as you do to theirs. \n\n* Be disciplined about having a healthy work-life-balance. Do not burn yourself out. There is no medal for sacrificing your health, only depression.\n\n\n\nI'm sure there is more.

So, I do know a few things. \n\nPublishing in finance is extremely hard if you aim for good journals. It seems to be quite common to see people finishing a PhD in finance without any publications. It's not common to see finance PhD applicants with an extensive list of papers published and, when they do have papers, it's usually not top journals. Your articles should at least tell the school that you know what research is, that you are able to produce some results, and you are committed to that. Then they can help you to become a top researcher.\n\nWork experience seems to be more relevant for accounting PhDs, much more than usual compared to other fields. It depends on how you sell this experience in your application, and whether the program is a good match for you or not. Some programs see much more value on work experience and teaching experience than others. \n\nBeing a foreigner by itself shouldn't really matter. The vast majority of business PhD students are international students. Being a foreign can have an indirect influence. For example, if you are unable to obtain strong letters of recommendation because there is no strong research in your country.\n\nNow, business PhDs in general are very competitive. Applying widely and making a very good selection of schools are critical to have a realistic chance of success, even for very strong applicants. Current applicants are expecting things to be harder than usual after the pandemic. I've seen people applying to more than 20 programs in finance this year because of that, something I had not seen before (usually, I would see a list of about 15 programs). \n\nAnd, of course, there are many important aspects of an application that you didn't mention. For example, your GMAT/GRE score, your math knowledge (finance and accounting applicants are typically expected to have very strong knowledge about calc, linear algebra, econometrics, etc.) and your coding skills (not just using the existing functions of the software).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/klx35q/need_an_advice/ghbn0vd/"}, "3223": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Prudent_Astronomer_4", "Date": 1609188582, "Score": 1, "Body": "Sorry to hear it.

If you are wanting to do research outside of the field of education, I appreciate that you are attempting to get teacher training/experience\u2014 so many PhDs/faculty have no teaching experience but are hired to teach, because they are experts in their field... this is often problematic.\n\nHowever, there are some serious issues with TFA (as well as with other \u201curban teacher programs\u201d). I say this as a K-12 educator and someone who is finishing a dissertation on racial equity in public schools. \n\n1. TFA creates a narrative about teaching that it is a \u201cnice, altruistic\u201d stop for those who don\u2019t know what to do after college/need something else to fill a gap on their resume before applying to graduate school or finding a higher paying job in corporate America. It doesn\u2019t usually create lasting educators which   further contributes to the inequities and educational debt BIYOC face in this country.\n\n2. TFA doesn\u2019t actually prepare people to be effective, high quality educators which is a disservice to the soon to be teachers and an even bigger disservice to the students who sit in these classrooms. The mentors/coaches who are training pre-service TFA members have less than 3 years of education experience themselves, but yet, they are somehow qualified to train others to teach in classrooms. It\u2019s a cycle that produces more unprepared, low-quality educators with limited resources to go into classrooms that actually need more resources and high-quality teachers.\n\n3. The program creates a view that reinforces the \u201cwhite savior - altruistic\u201d worldview by putting predominantly white educators into classrooms where students look nothing like them/are predominantly BIYOC. This creates a situation where teachers are culturally ill-equipped to effectively teach and connect with their students and even handle their own classrooms. This is made even harder by the fact that the students know they will predictably be losing their teachers every two years, so they do not see the point in building a relationship with them. Relationships are some of the most important aspects of teaching. \n\nThere are tons of other issues with TFA, but this post is long enough.. so I\u2019ll stop here.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kjhcyy/is_doing_teach_for_america_for_two_years_between/ghe2h56/"}, "3290": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ThePhysicistIsIn", "Date": 1609249900, "Score": 6, "Body": "It's mostly a waste of time and no one cares.

V relatable. I didn't really struggle with productivity pre-covid, but it's been a killer working from home 24/7 and not having structure and separation between work and home life, and the holidays have only exacerbated this.\n\nThe things that have been helping me the most are\n\n* Having a set time when I know I am able to work most productively during the day. It is from 9:30 am - 12 pm. I wake up at \\~6 am every morning, so this is hours after I have already been awake, and relieves pressure to be productive right after waking up while still keeping me accountable to work. Before 9:30 am, I try not to feel guilty if I play on my phone, read the news, listen to podcasts, make breakfast, go for a walk, etc. I just start my day however feels best to me. If I feel like working in the early morning, I do. If I don't, I don't. But, when 9:30 am rolls around I tackle my most demanding, essential tasks. Anything else I do in the day is unimportant relative to what I work on from 9:30 am - 12 pm. I do try to get on my computer at \\~9 am to define what will be most important to work on in the 9:30 - 12 pm window, but I'm not upset if I don't start working prior to 9:30. I actively avoid scheduling meetings or appointments during this window.\n* Using the Focus Keeper app on my phone. From 9:30 - 12 pm, I work for 30 minutes interspersed with 5-minute breaks. I am quite strict with not checking phone/email/other distractions in the 30-minute work sessions - I can hold out for 30 minutes until it is a 5-minute break to do so.\n* Having a timer on my watch that goes off at 2 pm every day. If for some reason I have failed to work productively (or at all) from 9:30 am - 12 pm, the 2 pm timer goes off and  I know that if I am going to accomplish something for the day, I need to start it *right then*. I am a morning person so if I do not accomplish something by sunset, the chance of it getting done at all is nonexistent. During the holidays I have only taken actual holidays off, but on the surrounding workdays, I have had a higher instance of starting my \"real\" work at 2 pm as opposed to 9:30 am as is typical. I'm always grateful to the 2 pm alert from my watch that reminds me to buckle down if I have not already. This means that if I don't work when I \"expect\" to in the morning, it doesn't throw my whole day or ability to be productive off, because I have a sort of failsafe that allows me to get my head in the right space to work even if it's outside of my normal schedule.\n\nThis is not really something I do to be productive, but I try to be forgiving with myself. As I said, I didn't really struggle with productivity pre-pandemic. But now, even \"easy\" tasks can feel difficult. I think not getting down about what I have not accomplished is helpful because then I don't feel worse and worse about a lack of productivity, making it more difficult to start working. I have seen this sort of downward spiral in other PhDs a lot and a lot of PhD-related work is mentally demanding/fosters decision fatigue. I try my best to treat every day like a new day. And sometimes, even that 2 pm alert can feel like the start of a \"new day\" if I haven't yet gotten work done.\n\nAlso, you may enjoy this read: [https://nyti.ms/2IHIr4r](https://nyti.ms/2IHIr4r)\n\nBest of luck to you :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: thank you kind stranger for my first award!!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kmmfrt/how_to_get_going_again/ghfjajg/"}, "3329": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "blteare", "Date": 1609277759, "Score": 9, "Body": "Give parental controls to a responsible friend.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kmmfrt/how_to_get_going_again/ghfl91f/"}, "3330": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "zoeyzl", "Date": 1609278806, "Score": 3, "Body": "Context matters, friend.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kmnd0y/how_i_got_rejected_from_every_school_i/ghfnbz9/"}, "3331": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Jeromiewhalen", "Date": 1609279051, "Score": 3, "Body": "Yes and no.

Applied to medical schools and got rejected from 18 out of 18 of them.   \nGot tired of academia and started working in the industry. I was amazed by how different people's attitude towards you is. It was like, people actually cared. I think that the academic system is majorly broken and biases (at least in the states) in many ways, so I completely understand your frustration. It feels like it doesn't always matter how good you are/ what you wear/ etc., but rather other factors that shouldn't get into the decision process. \n\nAnyways, congrats on getting into a program. Stay focused on why you're doing what you're doing and why you wanted to do the PhD in the first place. Rejections (especially from academia) are meaningless. \n\nP.S I'm a first year PhD now.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kmnd0y/how_i_got_rejected_from_every_school_i/ghfvl7z/"}, "3346": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Dyingdyingdeath", "Date": 1609283135, "Score": 4, "Body": "What a shit thread.

I'm not sure where you live, but I'm also an immigrant and I understand the drive for higher education that your parents are enforcing on you and I understand the pressure you are under. \n\nAs an immigrant, (or international student) your parents probably worked hard their whole lives to provide for their families. My parents struggled in finding jobs, we dealt with racism, we dealt with being bypassed, we dealt with so many things. Deep down they felt that maybe their lack of education or lack of degrees from a US university negatively influenced their careers. They saw those with doctorates live much easier lives. So now they are pushing you to go further than them in terms of education. \n\nIt might hard for regular Americans to understand or for those who never immigrated to understand, but there is a clear correlation between education level and financial income.   Immigrants with higher education levels had it much easier than those without. Also especially in America, where the cost of health care and education are so high, you can't afford not to push for a better job and education is the most guaranteed way to that better job. So now your parents will push you for a doctorate. Medical, dental, optometry, pharmacy, academic, nursing, and education doctorates provide better lives than no doctorates. \n\nAmericans who aren't immigrants don't understand this, because their families have lived here long enough to have generational wealth. They have a basic fall back that you never will have. Also it's a lot easier for the son/daughter of a PhD holder to get into a PhD program then it will be for you. That's why they don't feel that pressure but you do. That's why they tell you that \"you want it for the wrong reasons\", but then they themselves go for the doctorate. They have the health care and the money but they tell you not to reach for it. The truth is that education leads to a better life. It's not like they have spent their whole lives dreaming of the PhD or that they deserve it more than you somehow since for them \"it's the right reason\". I've heard this from many PhD holders who question others for their reasons. \n\nOne thing you should know though is that among those doctorate degrees the only ones that ACTUALLY provide a better life are Medical, Dental, Optometry, and Pharmacy. The other doctorate degrees (including a PhD) is not worth it. I learned this the hard way. The golden standard for a PhD is having a faculty tenured position, but the majority of PhD holders will get there because older professors just don't retire (they have such great lives) and there aren't that many positions. \n\nIf you are going to study for as long as 5 years after undergrad go for something that will pay off. Also you might unlucky and have a horrible professor. They will stand in your way. Your success in medical, dental, optometry, and pharmacy won't depend on one person.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kdy82b/feel_like_im_gonna_throw_up_and_have_a_mental/ghgp8sn/"}, "3385": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ingridcarito", "Date": 1609298889, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you for your validation.

Safety nets that cannot really punish the PI for unjust/cruel behavior. And most of the time these safety nets aren't there yet, they need to be established and will not be established within academia itself without external help, because those safety nets will undermine the power certain people have. Also, because the process of bringing consequences to the actions of the people above you in academia will delay *you* and damage *your* perspectives, but not theirs.

I think research should be fun and curious, not a foundation for self-doubt. \n\n I have felt this way throughout my time as a student and now that I'm graduated  I'm just now noticing how disruptive/consuming the anxiety is, since I've had a couple of months of no research-related responsibilities as I waited for reviewer responses.  I honestly don't know how to describe my relationship with my advisor. That's part of my problem, I guess. My husband and best friend have told me it seems abusive to them, but my advisor seems well-intentioned, just oblivious/out of touch.  She tells me what to do, how to do it, and I do it. If I depart from the how or what I've been given, even if this alternative process or decision seems more consistent with my statistical or theoretical training, she often asks me to do more work or disregard what I've done. She has told me I've done too much work even when I've done what I thought she was asking or done something similar to what she's asked of me previously. It's like I am unable to trust my own judgment and haven't been given guidance on how to make good scientific judgments because there isn't any consistency in what I'm told, or so I perceive.

I think this is probably too specific of a question for anyone to give you super great advice. Have you considered reaching out to the department secretaries to see what the application process is like? It varies wildly by field, school, and department, and even individual faculty members. Having a faculty mentor from undergrad (not formal, was just a faculty member that I liked) really helped because otherwise I never would've been able to figure out what the application process for graduate school was like. I would've assumed you just look up programs and submit applications to them, but this couldn't be further from the case. \n\nIn my field (which mostly utilizes the apprenticeship model), if you know what's up, you do not even apply to programs until a faculty member tells you to. You could, but it would be a bad idea to do so and could get you sort of blacklisted from the program if you were rejected. The problem, in that case, might not be with your application, it would be with people lacking the funds/projects to bring you on as a student. \n\nI went through the process of scoping out several schools for my MS and PhD, but only applied to 2 programs - both of which I was accepted to (1 for my MS, and 1 for my PhD). In both cases, my future advisors told me that I should apply to the program. At that point, I applied to the programs, but it was basically a formality. I knew I would be accepted from the moment a faculty member told me to apply. In the case of my PhD, my advisor had 2 projects available - I told him I would accept 1, but not the other. So, going into my PhD, even with my advisor, there were sort of 2 applications in that he had to consider me for both projects, and then determine that I was an acceptable candidate for the project I was also interested in. Not to mention my application to the program generally. \n\nI don't know if this really makes sense or is useful to you. Hopefully, I am not making things worse by being confusing. I would recommend getting in touch with a faculty member in the field you want to work in from your undergraduate institution, who may have some advice about how you should approach applications to PhD programs. It might be simple, but it might be something closer to what I tried to describe (lol).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/knm9sa/if_i_applied_to_phd_programs_for_1st_dec_deadline/ghnmp05/"}}
