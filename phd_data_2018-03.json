I am doing my PhD in an academic institution whose official working language is English, in a country where English isn't an official language (not in Europe, but not very far from Europe). All my classes are in English. All the administrative and other staff required to interact with international students is required to speak (some) English.

Of course, this isn't an issue in the European countries where English is the main language (UK, Ireland), and almost isn't an issue in the Netherlands where almost everyone knows English and Dutch is easy to understand and learn for native English speakers - but in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc., it usually is a big issue.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/81qp38/american_scientists_why_dont_you_move_to_europe/dv5zra6/"}, "40": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bFSFM", "Date": 1520177601, "Score": 1, "Body": "I am in Germany ;)\n\nDoesn\u2019t apply to us for those things but perhaps we are the anomaly ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/81qp38/american_scientists_why_dont_you_move_to_europe/dv624pf/"}, "41": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "midipoet", "Date": 1520179551, "Score": 7, "Body": "Ok. First of all, try and not worry about the end goal. Worrying about that will do no good. It's very easy to worry about needing to write 75,000 words, but in reality it's a lot more manageable, and healthier to worry about bitesize chunks. \n\nSecondly, don't worry about how long it's taking you. I had funding for three years, and ended up taking nearly five years - having to work alongside at the end. There are no rules, and nobody judges you for taking longer. Life does things, gets in the way, tests you, etc, and it doesn't mean you are lazy, stupid, doomed to fail, or anything negative at all. \n\nThirdly, you think you hate your subject, but most of that is due to worry, and negative psychological attachment to the task at hand. Change that psychology and everything will change. \n\nFourth. Small steps. Start out with a framework for the thesis. At the start this may just be a chapter structure. Simple titles for each chapter, as well as overrall intro and conclusion. Then note down how many words you want each chapter (roughly). After this, start devising a structure for each chapter, just by writing headings. This can be simple: introduction, hypthosis, lit review, methodology, findings, discussion, conclusion (for example). Then note how many words you want in each of these headings. For the above example, let's say you decided 1000 words each section. That's 7000 words planned for your total word count. Seven of these chapters and you are up to 49000 words. \n\nNow, lastly, set a target of 250 good words a day, ramping up to 500 when you are in the rhythm after a few weeks. \n\nMake these good words, fully footnoted etc. \n\nThat target may sounds small, but if you have ~8 months left. That's 240daysx250words=60,000words, and that's not even ramping up to 500 words.\n\n250 words is a very manageable target. It won't kill you. Once it's reached, take the rest of the day off, guilt free. \n\nThat's my advice. Here if you need any more help or advice, or even just someone to chat to.

The dark nights of the soul that are part of everyone's PhD are so draining, I'm really sorry it's all gaining up on you.\n\nI managed to submit at the end of last year and defend last month. I tell you this only because if I can do it, anyone can (everyone says this but believe me, I mean it, I really wasn't built for this shit). Here's a list of things that got me through:\n\n1. Firstly, accept that it will not be perfect and that's good, because *it doesn't have to be perfect*. You can hand in an imperfect PhD and they will give you corrections. Pretty much everyone gets corrections and they are great because these corrections are a detailed list of things to amend. That's good!\n\n2. You have done the work and it's all yours. This is 90% of the battle. It's so easy to forget that the exam isn't designed to judge how good your work is, but rather to answer two questions: Did the person do this work, and is this work fit for a PhD. THAT IS IT.\n\n3. The only people you have to please are your examiners. I found that worrying about the judgment of four people and not every person alive and who might ever live took a lot of pressure off.\n\n4. Work that table of contents. Write the heading of each chapter and answer three questions: What does this chapter do for this thesis, what is this chapter telling the reader, and what evidence do I have. I found that writing the summary at the end of the chapter FIRST really helped, because it gave me clarity about what I wanted the reader to know when they had finished the chapter. Then it was just a matter of telling them.\n\n5. Work on one chapter at a time. Draft it and make it messy, it doesn't matter, just get it in place and then move on. You will edit and re-write, but the most important thing is that you conjure the ghost of this fucking thing. The writing breathes life into it, but you have to first be able to see its shape and form.\n\n6. To quote Henry Miller: \"When you cannot create, you can work.\" There's so much uncreative bullshit involved in a PhD like making graphs, formatting images, checking captions, formatting citations, filling out paperwork for submission, video editing/annotation, making diagrams, etc etc etc. Make a list of \"work\" tasks and when you're overwhelmed with writing, STOP, and just do some dumb work. This means that you are relieving yourself from writing but *still moving yourself forward*. It all counts!\n\n7. Outsource your life. Get grocery delivery. Take Lyfts if it makes your life easier. Bulk cook. Hire a stats person. Hire a cleaner. For a couple of months, do all the outsourcing you can afford; find what slows you down and pay someone else to do it, and forgive yourself for it. I put a hard limit of one month on this (depends on your resources) but it was invaluable. If you don't have cash, call in favours. Your friends have probably said \"If I can ever do anything ...\" so call them up and tell them they can, and give them your debit card a shopping list. I was kind of amazed at the number of people who were willing to come through for me in the final stages and I realised that letting people help you makes them feel good too so don't feel guilty about it.\n\n8. Stop worrying about your supervisors. If they're helpful, great, but if they're not you cannot stop making progress because of that so go boldly. When you really start burning through the work supervisors get excited about it (even the asshole supervisors) because it looks good for them to have students going out the door. If there's things your supervisors can do, make a list and TELL THEM. I found the more specific I could be the better their feedback was. Ultimately though, this isn't your supervisor's PhD, it's yours, so no matter what just keep going.\n\n9. Find people who are going through this. My university had lots of PhD writing events and I met people from loads of disciplines and ended up writing with a neuroscientist and anasthesiologist (not even remotely my fields!) and it was great because although our work had nothing in common we could still be super supportive of each other. It's also fun to find out about other peoples' work. I managed to also start a writing group in my uni library that met one day a week, where we'd just get into a room and write - there is something about the accountability of others that sharpens your focus. We carry it on now that we've all graduated by Google Sheets; we all put in our goals for the day if we're writing, then write what we accomplished. IT WORKS.\n\n10. Be gentle with yourself. You're good at this because you've already been at it for a long time. You're doing amazing work because you don't get to do a PhD unless you're capable of doing some amazing things. This is just a document to fulfil an exam requirement - this is not the last thing you'll ever do and it does not reflect you as a person, it's just the documentation of your research process. \n\nYou can do it!

I\u2019m finishing up my masters and am looking to start a PhD. During undergrad I worked as a research tech for a while. After undergrad, I volunteered for a bit at the National Smithsonian Zoo in DC. From here I entered the industry and worked in ecotox as a Biologist for a few years. In this time frame, I started my masters in Bioinformatics (which I\u2019m about to complete). Currently, I am the lab manager at an Ivy League institute in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and have been here for almost one year.\n\nSure, I cannot yet say I know exactly what you are going through (as least not quite yet). So maybe my advice will not be meaningful. But as for grumpy coworkers, I\u2019ve seen plenty. There will always be one or two (no matter the education level or job). People have bad days and good day or even bad years and good years.\n\nMaybe, again sorry if I\u2019m misreading, but try not to treat this person as something other than a person. Having seen the industry as a scientist and now back in academia, the structuring is vastly different here. In the industry, degrees don\u2019t matter more than a minor lunch conversation. In the academic lab, this is all that matters and people seem to like to often remind one another (maybe due to their own insecurities).\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine finding a job, it\u2019s difficult for most now anyway (barring education). My advice, for what it\u2019s worth, treating the support staff like lesser may make your life harder. They may aspire to be in a similar position. But as I said, this sounds like an isolated case and the grumpy person may just be in a bad point in their life.\n\nThat\u2019s my 2c anyway.

So one aspect of my decision to quit was most definitely \u201cburn out\u201d. I just did not want to study anymore. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my field and I still do research, but not being on a PhD means I can do this in my time and it\u2019s more for pleasure than for work. \n\nFunding was probably the next biggest reason I decided to leave. The university were giving me a less than ideal amount of money to live on while on the PhD. I would not be able to move out of my dad\u2019s with the finances available on the programme. As well as this, my friends have been asking me to do things like go on holidays and trips. Again, the financial aspect of the PhD would preclude me from doing these things. It may sound selfish, but I during my other years of study, I was so dedicated and focused that I didn\u2019t really do anything other than study. Again, this will be different to your experience. \n\nThe PhD life was something I feel I became very quickly accustomed to i.e. I learned what life would be like very quickly. I would say, and I think most people would agree with me, that a PhD is a very isolated experience and, while you\u2019ll have your supervisor and you\u2019ll meet other people, the experience is quite an isolated one. You\u2019ll spend a lot of time on your own doing the reading of books, journal articles, etc. Again, I can only speak from my experience in law which is a very doctrinal discipline anyway. You will probably have a different experience if you are conducting empirical research as you\u2019ll have things to look forward to, such as designing and conducting any field work you will be doing. I knew a few legal PhDers that were doing empirical research and they found the experience a little less isolated. \n\nThe PhD also hangs over your head. What I discovered is that I was constantly thinking about it. When I was doing my LLB and LLM, I found I could \u201cforget\u201d about it for periods of time and not feel bad. Not so with the PhD. Every time I wasn\u2019t thinking about it, I felt guilty and that I should be doing work. I know everyone will say that taking breaks is important, and they are completely correct, but managing to take breaks without feeling guilty may be more difficult than you think at first. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably be doing a lot of teaching if you do a PhD. The amount you do will probably be dictated by your finances. Most people do a lot if they need more money. This can be a very time-consuming activity. You need to make sure you strike the correct balance between doing the PhD and the amount of teaching commitments you take on. However, I loved the teaching. I think the fact I spent more time and effort on the teaching was what helped me realise I didn\u2019t want to do the PhD yet. Again, you\u2019ll need to test the waters yourself to see how much teaching you can cope with. \n\nI apologise that this seems all doom and gloom and it is because my experience was not the best. I could feel myself slipping back into a depression that arose earlier in life and I knew then I needed to get out. However, I know many people at Durham and other universities who love their PhDs! They acknowledge the issues I\u2019ve mentioned (the isolation and the how t constantly hangs over you) but they have managed to deal with that and they are thriving in the environment. What I will say is that whether you do it full or part time will probably make a huge difference! I want to go back eventually, but I know I will definitely do it part-time this time. From what I can see, those doing it part-time have a much better work/life balance and do not seem to suffer from the issues I\u2019ve discussed as much as full-time students. Finances are generally better, as is the isolation issue. Again, this is something for you to consider as doing the PhD part-time will probably extend it by another three years! \n\nI hope what I\u2019ve said has been useful and if you would like any clarification, please do get in touch!

I know the anxiety doesn\u2019t help with getting those thoughts settled in but know that you did the right thing in seeking treatment and, if anything, your supervisor is probably glad to know that you are managing your situation.

But I feel like the experience really depends on the circumstances in terms of money, supervisor and department. \n\nI have recently submitted a PhD in Social Sciences at a London university. I think the London context may be important because I know a lot of very miserable PhD students here. Money plays an important role because the quality of life on a limited scholarship can really suffer. I received a scholarship for 3 years but was in a degree that almost always takes 4 years (and they don\u2019t tell you that in advance). If your finances are okay and you have an affordable place to live, you are already in better shape than a lot of PhD students in London. \n\nBesides money, your supervisor is crucial. Doing a PhD in social sciences is very lonely in my experience because topics often don\u2019t really overlap with other people\u2019s work. Especially if you work in interdisciplinary social sciences you probably end up in departments where you kind of fit but also don\u2019t fit at all. My supervisors were pretty much clueless about the specific context of my PhD, so their help was very general. My PhD ended up being my own independent project but I did struggle massively during my first 2 years and wanted to quit pretty regularly. If you have a supervisor who is actually working on your topic, interested in you and willing to support and mentor you (not just push their name onto your publications), that is incredibly valuable. Again, not all of us have that (STEM or not). \n\nLast point, and I think/hope that this is not the norm in the UK, my department had a pretty toxic atmosphere and absolutely shitty facilities. It\u2018s hard to stay positive about research in a very competitive setting where everyone always attacks other people\u2019s approaches or points of view. And I don\u2019t mean the students - I have witnessed some pretty nasty arguments among professors. My department definitely did not have a supportive or nurturing atmosphere towards anyone, pretty much survival of the fittest. Also, the building facilities actually matter because you spend so much time there. I came from a university where everything was light, clean and PhD students had assigned offices. Arrived in London to be led into a smelly, dirty, dark room with only a few desks that everyone had to fight over. Not a big deal when everything is going well, but a problem when you are struggling with your research and hating your surroundings. \n\nPersonally, I can relate to the American and STEM experiences. Of course, even in bad circumstances, you can still get a lot of good things out of a PhD. However, I think it\u2018s important to acknowledge that your PhD experience doesn\u2019t depend on STEM vs Social Science or US vs UK but your specific circumstances. For me, it was tough and I am glad it\u2018s pretty much over. \n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/82mlpv/uk_phders_in_the_humanities_social_sciences_a/dvbc78a/"}, "151": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sedermera", "Date": 1520419079, "Score": 2, "Body": "Are you taking loans in order to cover your cost of living?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/82ju3j/how_badcommon_is_it_to_face_the_end_of_your_phd/dvbce2y/"}, "152": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LadyNelsonsTea", "Date": 1520419937, "Score": 2, "Body": "I go to weekly counselling sessions and tell my supervisors about it when we talk about what I've been up to (not what I talk about in the sessions, that's obviously private, but it takes time and energy out of your day).

A lot of the American STEM talk seems pretty alien to me, too. The fact that you'd have a great supervisor is a brilliant start. Makes all the difference. I meet mine (who is a star) once a month, which is standard. I was expecting a more collaborative process, but it's much more doing my own thing with feedback and steering. It took some getting used to, but it's a good system. \n\nI'm in my second year now and have settled into a good working pattern. Year 1 for me was largely not a good experience. I had no routine and I worked from home, 2 things which really sank me. I ended up working long into the night. I never saw any other students. Because I had no schedule, I always felt like I should be working. I'd be watching TV and would feel bad if I wasn't reading at the same time. That's not sustainable at all. \n\nNow, I work 5 days a week, 8 to 6 (with decent breaks), in the communal PhD office on campus. The difference this structure has made to the quality of my work is massive. And it's also helped me mentally. I leave all my books and my work in the office, taking nothing home. At 6pm, I'm done. This schedule is more than enough to finish within my allotted 3 years. I've definitely noticed a pattern in that the people who complain that they're behind, that they don't have enough time, are people who go on lots of holidays and people I don't often see at their desk. I look at it as an office job with an end product, being the thesis. Working in the office, physically separating work life from home life, is a huge help. As is working around other people doing the same thing, even if many are a bit in their own heads and despite one or two moaning Myrtles. \n\nThe amount of teaching you have to do varies depending on where you are and what you're studying. The thing I've been told over and over by graduates is that publications are everything if you want to work in academia afterwards. I went for some easy wins with this. My master's stuff was of a decent standard, so I rewrote and submitted one essay as an article and have split my master's thesis into two separate articles submitted to two different journals. On top of this, I'll be publishing one article from my PhD work. Rather than trying to start from scratch on new articles - basically new mini projects - I decided to work with what I already had so that I wouldn't take too much time away from the PhD. I've done a few conferences, which are hugely time consuming for prep work but useful for getting your face out there. Year one is lightest, workload-wise, so I did the articles from old work and 2 conferences then (one based on master's thesis, one on current PhD). Year 2 is heavier, so I'm doing just one conference and one paper, both adapted from PhD work. Year 3 will be all about writing up and, if possible, doing an international conference. (Conference advice I've had for CV building is do one in your field, one in an unrelated-but-relevant-to-your-topic/methods field, and do one international conference.) And then once it's all done I can edit the thesis for publication as a book, ideally. \n\nThe main thing to bear in mind, I think, is that if it's unbearably hard, something's wrong. It's not supposed to be like that. And some people love the drama of it, portraying themselves as heroes up against impossible odds, so they like to talk about it like it's some enormous battle, but it doesn't have to be. It's not supposed to be. Hope that's helpful!

You can hardly find an article predicting negative economic or political realities that could derail its recovery. Indeed, leading world economies started the year with slower but stable growth indicators. However, there are some resonant voices sounding the alarm.\n\nOn February 27, 2018 Bill Gates issued a stern warning that a financial crisis comparable in magnitude of the Great 2008 Recession that wiped out 8.8 million jobs and $19 trillion of the American household net worth is a \u2018certainty\u2019 in a near future. The Oracle of Omaha himself Warren Buffett expressed a similar ominous sentiment in his most recent annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Buffett, who almost maniacally hates debt, advised strongly against leveraging this year\u2019s investments with debt. He is renowned for practices of keeping the equivalent of at least 5% company market capitalization in cash on hand because he knows that being liquid is lasting leverage. When investors invest with their own money, a long-term perspective can be assured. Buying on the margin, on the other hand, is great when market only goes up; it\u2019s bad idea during volatility markets face today.  \n\nThis week we also heard politicians chiming in on the economy. Ron Paul, former Libertarian congressman, warns that market dangers today are bigger than ever. Wall Street is incapable of seeing the big picture, Paul claims pointing to Federal Reserve massive injections of easy money of the past decade that led to huge distortions within the financial system. He believes that is about to be repaired\u2013this time for good. In his judgment, the 2008 market dip did not go deep enough. This time stock market can lose as much as 50% of its value. The Federal Reserve policy gamble of printing money in unprecedented amounts, keeping interest rates low for too long and growing budget deficits forebodes problems\u2026and drumbeat of the debt, debt, debt echoes everywhere.\n\nProfitable spillover to main street did not occur as evidenced in increased net worth gap between the relatively smaller portion of American passive income earners and those who work for their money. Indeed, the opposite took place. According to Credit Suisse\u2019s global wealth report published in November 2017, the world\u2019s wealthiest people have seen their share of the globe\u2019s total wealth increase from 43.5% at the height of the 2008 financial crisis to 50.1% in 2017, or $140 trillion of the total global wealth that now stands at $280 trillion. 3.5 billion of the world\u2019s poorest adults each own less than $10,000 in assets. Collectively these people, who account for 70% of the world\u2019s working age population, constitute a mere 2.7% of global wealth. So much for the brilliance of our political class. Upon reflection, considering how profitable economic crises are for global elites, a cynic might think they are generated on purpose.\n\nDisillusioned with the financial engineering of conjuring the economy via printing press, 2018 economy for a change is reportedly driven by consumer consumption and business investment. The resultant demand-backed economic growth in theory should propel wages upwards and enhance living standards of billions working for a living. The Keynesian philosophy of mitigating economic recessions by dint of monetary policies of central banks (a.k.a. quantitative easing) to nudge the aggregate demand inflated corporate earnings and stock prices\u2013without proportional growth in the real economy.\n\nSubsequently, the primary benefactors of the past decade included merely corporate managers with their well-endowed expense accounts, salaries and bonuses along with decadent dividends handed out to shareholders like Easter basket brimming with candy. The Wall Street speculator is a horse of a different color getting the proverbial corporate cake and eating it too.\n\nOn the other hand, incomes of workers\u2013the actual producers of goods and services\u2013remained stagnant for a decade. What we are observing right now is the process of economic normalization in which profits are distributed somewhat proportionally among all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, for workers to actualize their earnings, executives and shareholders will have to relinquish some of their wealth. That has always been a bitter pill to swallow.

With good chances but of course no guarantee that the student will sufficiently recover to work in our lab again. And our advisor started fighting for it already days after the accident, as soon as shown there's any hope, although these chances back then seemed very low. Although he was/is angry at the student for not having been more careful, and terrified about the impact on his own and the student's future.\n\nAnd it's not anywhere near the first time he supported someone through illness and difficulties. And he's also hired people with diagnoses, traits and past many wouldn't take chances with - even after suffering lots of trouble by some.\n\nWe each (student or postdoc) have an office space - desk with desktop computer - outside (but near) lab, not more than 7 people per office. Not every group in the department does, but our advisor took care that we have these and other good working conditions. \n\nBecause he wants us to want to be at work and work, not to force us. He lets us work and not work almost any time (and from anywhere, for non-lab work) - as much flexibility as physically possible, usually, as long as we do what needs to get done and meet external deadlines.\n\nWe have group dinners several times per year (usually when someone is successfully finishing). That seems paid for and encouraged by the department, but our advisor sometimes fights with the administration so that we can do it in really good restaurants and more often.\n\nWe each get own conference budget from the school, and our advisor includes also additional travel funds into his grants so when someone has deserving results and needs to attend conferences beyond own budget, it's also covered. At least on one occasion he took cheaper, less convenient transatlantic flights himself, so that us two back then most junior students (in MSc, thus not yet having own budgets) also could go (that's quite a big sacrifice as he's very tall and also has other difficulties with travel).\n\nOverall, my advisor generally listens to and tries to fulfill our suggestions and needs, about research and everything else. He is really nice and cares about us a lot. He isn't perfect, but he is trying, and he is better than any I have heard about in detail (at least about things which are important to me and within advisor's control).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/83d4s5/how_about_some_great_advisor_stories_for_a_change/dvh4q53/"}, "227": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "psychmancer", "Date": 1520685897, "Score": 3, "Body": "A lot of how your PhD will be comes down to your supervisor and there is only one way to explain it \u2018it is a massive lottery\u2019.\n\nI do a PhD in psychology and neuroscience and my supervisor is an excellent guy.

They require long hours into the night and don\u2019t allow any input into scientific design. Personally for me that would be a nightmare. But I understand that those PhDs work with that, like that atmosphere of a strict working environment and do just as good work as me.\n\nWhat I would suggest is when applying be very discerning and rigorous in your selection of your supervisor. Ask about working hours, allowed input, training opportunities, publication rights etc. Some will be totally thrown off by it but you need to remember that for them it is a big commitment and they have the right to grill you to make sure you are suitable.

It\u2019s brutal - in my case I find that it adds 25-30 hours on top of my work every week. Some thoughts from my experience:\n\n* Streamline as much as you can your daily life (grocery delivery? Dry cleaner home pickup? automated bill payments? etc.) so that you can be most efficient and not waste any time when September hits. Prepare for a fragile routine of eating enough (and not junk food), sleeping enough, a bit of entertainment/social time (not much room for that, but enough to keep your sanity), and exercising. This will be a marathon, not a sprint. Though you may find yourself sprinting throughout all of it.\n* Have a comfortable study/office room at home where you can study efficiently and without distractions. Especially important if you don\u2019t live by yourself.\n* Be very organized when setting up your university\u2019s cloud of choice (OneDrive, Google Drive, even a personal Dropbox, etc.) - create a granular arborescence and use a meaningful naming convention so that you can easily find your files once they start accumulating in large numbers.\n* Find the syllabus for the first term and read the required books before the term. This will save you precious time. Purchase and install any software that may be required ahead of time to confirm it works. Understand how your courses will build upon each other (e.g. research methods).\n* Make sure your employer understands what you\u2019re embarking upon, how long it will take, what it means for your evenings and weekends (no longer available for take-home work), and what they can expect in return (a smarter, more capable you, perhaps even some research contributions that apply to your work).\n* Keep in mind that there\u2019ll be some low points regardless of your preparation. Fatigue will set in. Keep your eyes on the next small milestone - turning in a big paper, finishing a term, finishing an academic year, finishing all the coursework, etc.\n* Find a good classmate who has a lifestyle similar to yours and help each other out, even over a long distance. You can pick each other up through phases of doubt and stress.\n\nAnd always keep in mind that you\u2019re doing something great for yourself, and that the hardships will pass.

It should tell you if what was found was relevant to your interests. If it doesn't, it's poorly written and there's probably no point in reading the rest of the paper. However, this is very rare in peer-reviewed work published in high-impact journals. If you're not sure, read the conclusion (or the last paragraph of the discussion if there is no separate conclusion). A discussion often throw out ideas and speculation to help spur readers (who are typically other researchers in the field) into thinking creatively about the topic. That is much of its purpose.\n\n&gt;Generally verbose \n\nThis is not my experience at all. Most research I read has a pretty good economy of words. It's difficult to write a short paper on a complex topic without omitting relevant information. At the risk of being presumptuous, is it possible that you are lacking some knowledge to understand important clarifying statements that may seem like bloviation? If you want punchier articles that are quick to read and usually have a focussed and impactful finding, look in \"letters\" journals.\n\n&gt;and disorganized text, \n\nIt can be difficult to appropriately organise concepts in a research paper. Sometimes there are complex interrelationships between different aspects that need to be shuffled around during editing to achieve the most logical flow. Again, I think most research in high-impact journals is well organised given these constraints.\n\n&gt;and the \"Conclusion\" is often some banality that would apply to 94% of research papers and reads more like a generic 5-paragraph 3rd grader essay conclusion than something that actually conveys meaningful information.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this claim. The majority of the major technological advancements in the modern world were once conclusions in a research paper. If the conclusion is something that is already 'known', then the work is either reproducing earlier work, or utilising a novel technique to confirm previously held beliefs. This is a *good* thing, and is of central importance in science.\n\n*******************************************\n\nIt's also quite possible that you're misunderstanding the intended audience for research papers. Most papers aren't intended as tutorials on the topic. They are to report new results to academic peers. Most broad topics will have plenty of books that will explain what the field is about in a more systematic way. For highly specialised topics, there is an awkward gap between the prerequisite knowledge that you would have learnt from books and/or completing an undergraduate degree, and the details that are only published in the form of papers. There is really no way around this; if no book exists that leads directly into the research, then you have to learn from the research papers themselves unless you have access to experts who can explain it to you. If this is a necessity in a field that you're studying, then *great*; you just came up with an idea for a book!\n\nI agree with a previous poster that review articles are the most accessible to start with. Of course, if the field you're interested in is cutting edge, there may *be* no review articles yet. PhD theses are also a good place to look. They will have at least one introductory chapter that sets the scene for the work that's presented in later chapters. Mine had *four* introductory chapters: one general introduction in fairly plain English describing motivations and a general overview of the processes, two covering different aspects of the underlying theory, and one describing computational methods that would be used in the work. This was followed by three chapters that were basically extended papers, generated by putting back in much that was taken out of my papers for publication. If you read and understood the introductory chapters, you would be armed with the knowledge to learn from my peer-reviewed papers.\n\n\n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/84m80r/why_are_research_papers_so_poorly_organized_and/dvrzoil/"}, "330": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "kashiman290", "Date": 1521185303, "Score": 2, "Body": "I feel ya.
