Generally a PhD in STEM is paid for anyways (research or teaching assistance stipends), so not much need exists for external funding. I have seen rare cases where a company will pay for a PhD (higher than a graduate student stipend) but they either make your research project something they are interested in, or ask for a commitment for the same number of years as your spent on your PhD for you to work for them.

The 3rd year is the hardest because you're in limbo -- it's too late to quit yet you are not close to finishing.  \n\nI noticed that my personality and hers were slowly changing and tiny issues started to accumulated.  Eventually we broke it off since our future became very uncertain since we both wanted to pursue our own careers.  Upon reflection, I became my worst enemy.  I notice that I was becoming increasingly critical of everything while she became less tolerant towards my personality flaws.  The stress was indeed driving me to the brink.  I also have stomach and anxiety issues now.  The relationship was becoming toxic and that very apparent when we were physically together.  We would just argue and be spiteful towards each other.  We eventually decided it would be the best to end it and stay friends.  I don't regret my decision, but I do wonder whether the relationship was salvageable.  \n\nWith that said, I would recommend talking about what your future plans are and what your true emotions are for each other.

I just finished up my 4th year of my Engineering PhD. I have chronic right sided abdominal pain and horrible GERD, along with a variety of other things that are perhaps too detailed to go into. But to be honest, it is only recently (up to a year) that I began to wonder about my issues being stress-induced and psychosomatic. Even now, I really have no clue if my issues are 10% or 90% due to stress.\n\nThe stress and physical pain cause someone to be more reclusive. I've been in a relationship with the same person for the entire time. While we aren't necessarily on bad terms, it has affected our relationship quite a bit. Most of the time when she does things, it's with other people - we dated for several years before the PhD program and this was never the case before. When you are stressed or in chronic pain, you just do not at all want to go out and do things. \n\nI'll try to give insight, but take what I say with a grain of salt, because I don't even have my own situation worked out well.\n\nI think the question of whether or not to stay together is mostly your decision, since you are the one most inconvenienced by the other persons\u2019 situation. What if it continues to be this way even after the PhD program? \u2013 if he wants to pursue academic or government research, it usually continues to be stressful. I feel confident that you leaving the situation probably won\u2019t fix anything for him; it could actually reduce his personal stability. It's important to have other people around us to keep us sane. If he goes in to school, talks to his professor to give some updates, then goes home and sits in isolation, the picture will get darker with one less person in his life. However, if you are extremely unhappy and you can\u2019t hold your feelings back, it\u2019s probably best to leave him. Are you outwardly frustrated with him multiple times a week and blame him for the way things are? In these cases, you may be right, but it\u2019s probably best to leave him if this happens all the time, but only you know the truth to this.\n\nWhenever somebody is subject to a lot of trauma/stress, the mind seeks ways to shield itself from the associated misery. This is why people who are abused or experience traumatic events are more likely to develop addictions. It may explain why your boyfriend just wants to sit inside and play video games. It takes his mind off of the problem. But this causes a vicious cycle, because the video games just equate to lost time and falling behind in the PhD, which leads to more stress. Remember the final exam you had that you put off until the night before and started freaking out about it? For those getting their PhD, there can be long stretches of time that feel just like this, but continuously.\n\nA few times a year, my PhD advisor asks me what I do to de-stress. He reaffirms that it is necessary to exercise (or something like this) in order to stay physically and mentally healthy doing what we do. Your boyfriend would probably benefit immensely from some sort of physical or mental de-stressor, such as aerobic exercise, meditation, yoga classes, etc. For some reason, these things are like the magic bullet for what your boyfriend is going through. You can\u2019t de-stress the same way with video games, television, movies, etc. 12 hours of video gaming doesn\u2019t have the same effect as a 30 minute jog, or a 30 minute yoga session. Actually, from personal experience, 12 hours of video games only certainly makes the situation/stress worse. Many people with mild or moderate stress turn to these things (exercise, yoga, etc.), and your boyfriend probably needs them moreso, but it sounds like he\u2019s not using any of these things from your description of him. If you decide that it is worthwhile to stay with him, you could probably help him a lot by trying (and you may need to try hard\u2026) to get him onboard with some of these activities that are regularly planned, like a jog every morning, or yoga classes 3 nights a week - Youtube also offers Yoga classes  ;)\n\n\nIt also seems obvious that if your boyfriend can't get a handle on things, he should stop doing what he's doing. But this is a very hard thing for a person in his situation to acknowledge.\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_4xlx85.json"}, "87": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "RevisedMonk", "Date": 1471155861, "Score": 1, "Body": "Wow, sounds exactly like what I'd write.

One of my greatest fears was to feel alone if it turned out that I didn\u2019t know about the topic, and she seemed reeeeally supporting. So I enrolled. Now, after more than 7 years, I\u2019m still working on that. She doesn\u2019t know anything about my topic. I\u2019m completely alone and I have to manage my research to get results on my own.\n\nThe project she designed (and presented to the local government for founding and they accepted) was half copied from the bibliographic research of a former student on a different subject, that turned out that vaguely shared some properties. She added some new references and extracted some conclusions about what to do, and just presented that. Now, I\u2019m finally writing my thesis and when I write my bibliographic revision it turns out that all her conclusions are wrong. I\u2019ve been expending 7 years doing something extremely difficult that doesn\u2019t work well because instead of doing what every paper claims that work, she decided to do what all papers claim that doesn\u2019t work, but she decided she would work. It wasn\u2019t unresearched, it was researched and they claimed that it wasn\u2019t good, and she didn\u2019t let me change anything, I had to stick to her *wonderful* plan and now I have to find a way to defend what I did and why I did it, knowing that I shouldn\u2019t have done it. Isn\u2019t life wonderful?\n\nIn 7 years I have only published **one** paper. I wrote the second in September 2010, she only had to correct it and send it (because she has to correct everything\u2026 but only the literature, that\u2019s what she likes. Not the real data, not the procedures\u2026 She changes the literature). She started to do it in December 2015. Still isn\u2019t approved because she likes to fiddle so much with grammar and syntax that all journals ask her to rewrite it again (wordy, verbose, obscure are literal terms used to describe the paper by editors). I have material to write 3 more papers, but she doesn\u2019t want to do it (she expends her time reforming her house, and travelling abroad for weeks, and that kind of things). And she doesn\u2019t know anything at all about half of my research. And she is not going to learn; she clearly stated that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t like those computer things\u201d (I\u2019m completely alone on that part). She makes us work 8-9 hours on the lab and, afterwards, you get \u201chomework\u201d to do for the night. She thought that we expended too few time on the lab daily so she forbid us to take a 15 minute rest on the evenings. You see people that are working on my topic and are multicountry teams with 12-15 people and a lot of founding. I am alone doing that, without help, and with less than 1% of the money that people have. They keep publishing my things because people do real research on my field, and meanwhile my boss prefers to give speeches about liberty in the third world than doing her job, to the point that I get anxious every time I have to search a paper on my field because I fear I will find something of my work already published again and I will have to start again to get enough to defend the thesis\u2026\n\nSo\u2026 yeah, perhaps this is the tread of the rants, but I really know how you feel. I know what it is to have an incompetent supervisor and the problems that they give. And I also feel really alone.

Not even my friends understand me, and I\u2019ve even lost many of them in the last years. Only my team mates (everyone working in a very different field, because in my lab, instead of working on something specific, everyone gets something at random depending of the mood of the supervisor when they arrive) understand the situation, because we are all living it.\n\n**I can only tell you that if you want a PhD, you will get it. It doesn\u2019t matter if your research changes the world or it is just a bunch of data that you managed to tie together in some dark way.

I'm in my 6th year and finishing in April and it has been a tough journey mostly because of my PIs and their lack of structure and guidance in my research project. Bench research has become monotonous for me and while I feel like an expert in my field, some minor experiments I can't seem to get to work hold me back from getting my degree currently. I won't be doing bench work after I finish.\n\nHowever, while I may not continue along the traditional PhD career path (academia/tenure) I found some interest in pursuing intellectual property law with my PhD. Law firms look for PhDs in biomedical sciences, physics, engineering, etc. to do patent prosecution and may even pay for you to attend law school (although that is becoming less common).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_500iso.json"}, "240": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "javier1287", "Date": 1472479064, "Score": 1, "Body": "Perhaps I didn't said the correct word. I'm from Spain and sometimes this kind of concepts related with studies take a different meaning depending on the country. After finishing high school, I studied chemistry 5 years at university. That's what I called career, and I think it is not the correct word for that in English. After that, I realized that I had learn a lot of things, but only in a superficial way, like if they had told me what could be done, but not how to actually get it done. That's why I decided to start the PhD, as it allowed me to do real chemistry, in a laboratory, and use real instruments to solve problems (not just some examples in books about 19th century issues). If I focus just on that, I got what I wanted.\n\nI don't know what I will do when I finish (in a few months, I hope). Probably I will only need a temporal break to relax and see things different. Some days I wake up and I don't feel like working never again on a laboratory (but anyway I go there and I do what I have to do). I know that my PIs are the problem, and probably changing them would improve the situation, but I'm afraid that their way of doing things is more extended that it should and in any other place would be essentially the same (I see too many people around with similar problems).\n\nWhen I finish, I will calmly study my options and decide what to do. I'm sure I don't want to continue at the university. I've seen enough of it to know that I would not adapt to some things that are common there. Perhaps I will work for a private laboratory, perhaps research if I feel like dealing with it, or perhaps quality control... Or perhaps I could just break with it and try something different. I like photography and I'm good at it. Taking some studies about that is feasible and would allow me to work professionally at it. I will think about it seriously in a few months, when everything finishes.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_500iso.json"}, "241": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Laptopbutt", "Date": 1472492207, "Score": 2, "Body": "I see.

I know many people that have taken time off. Working towards a PhD typically physically and mentally defeat people so most people I know take a long vacation after they are done.\n\nI don't regret pursuing my PhD even if research is not my end goal. If you are like me, it is the science that is the most intriguing so I will never separate myself from that.

When you work, the results don't belong to you, but to the research group, and is the PI who decides how they are used. Of course, if they present a poster with your data you have to be given credit and appear as an author. The same thing happens with papers, and of course your data is your for your PhD, for example. Even when I leave the laboratory, all my laboratory notebooks, notes and research result will remain in the lab. I can keep copies of those things for my personal use, but the originals remain in the lab and their use are tied to the PI will. In my experience, as long as you get cited as an author and you get the recognition for having done it, he can present it on your name without any problems. You can prove that the poster is yours for your curriculum or whatever you need it to be proven.
