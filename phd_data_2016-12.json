One that is more-or-less what you are proposing for your PhD, and the other must be something completely unrelated that you come up with entirely on your own.  It is supposed to show that you not only have depth of knowledge, but breadth...and that you can correctly use the scientific method to propose a reasonable hypothesis...that you can test.

Everyone dreads this exam because during the \"Defense\" of it, they can literally ask you anything they want, and always get  you to the point of saying \"I don't know\".  Then, they want to see how you react when you don't know.

I assume you are in the US. The way a PhD generally works is that in the STEM field  (what I assume you will go into if you are interested in pharma) PhDs are all paid for. Further, you get a stipend to live on as well. In your PhD you will take classes for the first year (depending on program, could be 1.5 years) but the rest of your 5-7 years are spent doing research. A PhD is considered more than a full-time job, so having a job on the side is not really an option.\n\nYour salary can come from a few places. If your advisor is well funded (has lots of grants) he will likely pay your salary through his grants. If your advisor is not well funded,  he will likely make you be a teaching assistant for 1-2 classes a semester, in which case the department pays for your tuition and salary. The third option is for you to apply for your own funding. This is generally done during the first year of your grad school. There are many governmental  (nih, nsf, DoD,..) and private (gates foundation, AHA, ...) sources for funding. Your school might also have a few grants available internally. For most, you need a research proposal, which generally means you need to know what you will be working on (depends whose lab you work in, and what you do).\n\nThe application process from far looks pretty similar to undergrad (you apply to the school, you need letters of reference and personal statements) but the successful applicants generally know who they want to work with  (unlike undergrad, you will spend 90% of your time working for one professor) and have contacted that person telling them they are interested in their lab.\n\nFor most top tier school, you need a good GPA, GRE scores, letters of recommendation  (from tenured/tenure track professors not really others) and a history of research (with hopefully publications with your name on, or poster presentations at national conferences) ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_5gzh1o.json"}, "59": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Systemofatown", "Date": 1481128046, "Score": 6, "Body": "I know this isn't exactly what you are looking for, but have you tried the software Mendeley?

I mean I always feel like I never have enough time in the lab, but one of the nice bit of what I do is  about 50% computer modeling and 50% wetbench/clinical work, so I am not always tied down to my desk and can do it at home before going to bed and stuff. \n\nMy PI is pretty [really] awesome and lets me be the driver of my own sort of projects (with his guidance and \"suggestions\" of course), but it's good because I'd say of my several projects, about 60-75% are based on all the grants and what not he has for the lab, then the remainder are a lot of the high risk-high reward projects that are cool to do and if they work would be amazing.\n\nIn pharmaceutics, it can be incredibly interdisciplinary. I, for one, have to have a fairly good knowledge base in statistics, DiffEqs, computer programming, physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, and microbiology. \n\nAs for Funding:\n \nI've applied to a grant in the past to get me some extra monies, and it has been successful. Now that I'm into the PhD, the department provides me with a stipend for 2 years (anything after that is supposed to be supplied by my PI). I also have plans to apply for some grants outside of this just because I'd like the extra money. \n\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_5gzh1o.json"}, "121": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "JForseti", "Date": 1481527385, "Score": 1, "Body": "Third for Mendeley, I have nothing to add, it works great.

My last day was today, and I start my new job next month. It was the hardest decision I have ever made, but I personally felt it was the right one for me. I had no data after two years of experiments due to equipment failure, and, to make matters worse, my advisor is leaving my university for a university in a different state at the end of the calendar year. With little to no progress after so much effort, I found myself in a similar position to you; I dreaded getting up in the morning to go to campus and was also seriously considered wrapping my car around a tree. I went to counseling to talk over the decision and get over the feelings of regret and guilt if I did decide to quit, and eventually had the epiphany that I was having \"healthy\" procrastination. My brain was trying to tell me that I no longer had the passion for what I was studying, and that I could find something that would rekindle my fire and drive. I ended up finding a great job that lined up more with what I felt my talents are.

For instance, I did tons of human tissue culture, gene expression, cloning, and a few other things in grad school and I will continue to use them for as long as they are relevant. When I finished my PhD, I went on to do a post-doc that used none of those things and was on a very different topic. I wanted to expand my skillset during my postdoc because it's far more difficult to do once you start an actual career. So I added bioinformatics to my skillset. Now I'm a new professor and I'm starting my research program that uses all of my skills (tissue culture, bioinformatics, etc.) to answer new problems. \n2) If you want to stay in academia, the idea is that you actually want to get away from your mentor/current network after graduation in order to show that you can be productive independently at a new place.

You're fucking awesome at what you do, and teaching is the most rewarding way to share your beautiful brains with the world. Create a detailed syllabus for yourself, plan as far ahead as you can, but be prepared to improvise and change that plan as you go. Having it will give you a sense of control and stability to start with. Practice your lesson with a friend. Timing is key. Begin with a think-pair-share task (just google) to get your students involved and engaged.

Honestly I'm glad I followed my heart, despite all my fears and misgivings and assumptions about being undervalued and underappreciated outside academia, because the world outside academia can be just as messed up and crazy, but also provides so much more flexibility and joy because it's a much better fit for my personality and interests.  This may also be quite true for you.  \n\nBefore you started your PhD, what were some of your favorite activities, passions or interests?\n\nMy advice: never try to consume yourself with what others will think.  It's easy to say, really really hard to do, especially after spending so much time in academia, but what others think really doesn't matter in the end.  It's your life.  They don't suffer when you suffer.  And only you can reap the benefits of taking action to make yourself happy.  1 or 2 years after you leave the ivory tower, you will look back and so many of the worries that are at the top of your mind now won't even register as a concern anymore.  Changing your environment is one of the fastest ways to change your expectations and concerns.\n\nIf you are in a toxic environment, the best thing you can do for yourself is to get yourself out of it, and to engage in something you really love and enjoy.  You need to distract yourself in a guided fashion, because otherwise you'll marinate in self doubt, guilt, shame and whatever social pressures your program has erected to keep people going.  If you're already pretty sure you want to leave, that's probably the right thing to do.  Don't damage your body or your mental health for the sake of someone else's approval.  Their approval will not return you your health or your self confidence.\n\nWhat does matter though, is what you have lined up next.  I'm pretty sure that you will feel really confident leaving if you have an idea of what you want to pursue next.  This angst you're feeling will be the same at the end of your PhD if you choose to continue, only you will be 2 years older, with 2 more years of your life passed in what sounds like relative misery.  If you are already in the process of leaving, try not to focus on the drama of what you're getting out of.  Instead, try to think about how to build yourself a soft landing pad, where you can heal and move on with your life with new purpose and energy.  That can mean living with family for a bit, it can mean traveling for a bit.  It can mean volunteering for awhile.  Whatever it takes to get yourself feeling hopeful and interested in life again.\n\nWhat did you initially start your management PhD to do?  (Also I'm a bit intrigued by what you're studying.

No; definitely not.  It depends on if the topic of your thesis and the nature of your experience, both inside and outside your PhD work.  If your skills are relatively easy to apply to careers outside the lab/research group, you will have more options in integrating that exact skillset into your future work.  Most people stop caring about that pretty quick once they enter the \"real world\" though, because your priorities and concerns quickly change :P  If you're talking about academia, or straight research careers in industry, then you may be more constrained given people like to hire those who have the best fit for a position, which will include experience and skillsets. \n\n2.  No.  In fact I think it's easier to move after the completion of a PhD, especially if you get a job that's not related to academia.  Even within academia, you have to follow the job market, and you will build a new community in your new home.  The world is also a small place, and if you frequent well traveled circles in your topic of interest, you may be surprised to see many of the same people popping up.  What I've found is that, although I miss the community I built in grad school, it means I have a bigger network now (I moved from the East Coast of the US to the West Coast for my job, and now instead of just having one big friend group on the east coast, I have two.)  People move all over the country and world after they graduate, chasing jobs or SOs.  Our adult world is centered around making and maintaining global networks these days. \n\n3. All researchers, regardless of their status, have to at least initially get hired by appealing to the hiring committee in a university or institution or company.  That means someone will always be technically \"in charge\", at least until you get to the very very top of an org, in which case you're likely not doing research anymore anyway (C-suite people, dept heads, deans, etc are usually doing admin or strategic work).  \n\nAs you begin on a research career, you will have to continually pass board approvals, get funding or project proposals approved, or go through academic tenure reviews, all of which will judge the quality and nature of your work based on external assessments.  Politics will also come into play in this question, so being a great people person never hurts and matters more and more the higher you get in an organization, regardless of who you are.
