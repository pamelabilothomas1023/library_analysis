Sounds like I am reading about my self 6-12 months ago when I started. \n\nI am doing neurology from a background in computer science, and I read a lot in psychology. I did go to 3 different psychologists for different problems, mainly GAD and some depression. And a friendship with a toxic friend. He is never wrong, somewhat on the the autism scale (probably asperger's syndrome: he said he learned what do different expressions mean growing up, and how to mimic them), and has BPD (people are great/Evil, I was an angel in his eyes, until I become the one is to blame for what he is feeling). He made me question myself and my world, and I don't know if he is the reason behind my disassociation attacks but I highly doubt it. I knew him for 6 years, the last 18 months of those were hell on earth. \n\nSecond psychologist helped me ditch him. I simply moved that guy into trash can and never contacted him again. I learnt it is never bad to make mistakes (you still have to learn from your mistakes), but it is awful when someone keeps trying to make you feel guilty. It prisons you in you own brain, and when you start to doubt yourself is when you start OCD, at least the obsessive part.  \n\nThen, in addition to anxiety, I had full blown panic attacks. and a lot of disassociation, also, at the beginning of my PhD?! \n\nAfter months of psychotherapy with the worst psychologist on earth, or maybe I wasn\u2019t following, I honesty thought he hated me and/or scared of me. He was even making me nervous and made my panic attacks worse. I decided, fuck it, I went to a psychiatrist and took Citalopram 10mg. First month or so was like hell. More panic attacks, more disassociation and more OCD thoughts, bad, but nothing new. Then, after 2 months it was great. I then went on 20mg (which was the plan). Now, those 6 months are great, never had an attack or disassociation.   I am waiting to get another psychologist because I have to wait 1 year so that my insurance covers it. \n\nBefore SSRIs, I would look around you. Do you have toxic relationships that make you feel guilty for who you are? Did you move because of your PhD and don't have friends? Possibly somewhere where you don't speak their language, or you just can't make friends? Is you PhD set in its course, or are you not sure what the future holds there? I would strongly recommend going back home to your family and visiting a place where you have a lot of friends every 6 months at least if the move and no friends is the problem, this will help. \n\nFor now, I could tell you to keep hope. Believe me, I have been through hell and back. I have been convinced of many horrible scenarios, and I used to think tomorrow is not coming. but it got better when I never thought it could.\n\nAll the best.

We've talked about it often, and all of us had imposter syndrome to one level or another; many of us still have it.

You wouldn't be where you are if you weren't smart enough to be there.\n\nAs for tips, looking back from beyond the line...\n\n1) Take as many opportunities to learn new things that you can.  Go to conferences, talk to people there (don't just observe), go to sections outside your specialty.  You'll meet new people, learn new things, and you may find either (a) something you like to do better or (b) even better, something you never would have thought of that helps what you are doing now \n\n2) Work isn't life.  Live outside of work.  Don't neglect work, but REALLY don't neglect yourself. Look for things to do on campus (arts, film shows, music, clubs, sports, what ever floats your boat). Look for things around campus, in town, etc. \n\n3) Don't wait for your PI to do anything for you. It's on you to learn and to take the initiative. Some are supportive, others are just happy to have you slaving away on the bench and getting grants, and if you don't take an active stance in your own development, time can slip by. They may have a ton of useful knowledge, so don't be afraid to ask. Use the other students and post-docs as teachers as well; they've been there for a while and can help pass on institutional knowledge they've gathered over the years\n\n4) FAILURE = SUCCESS.  Experiments fail, grants are rejected, presentations are botched.  But, failure is the greatest teacher. It's hard, but take nothing personally.  Learn, observe, and grow. Accept the failures are part of the whole, and don't look at them as something to reject. I've had major experiments fail at the last minute, \"ruining\" months of work. Then, I stressed and gnashed my teeth and pulled my hair.  Looking back, those failures taught me more than any success I had. \n\n5) Find a neutral professor to act as a 2nd advisor, someone who doesn't work with your PI. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to, both to get a different perspective, or to get advice if you need it.

If your motivation is career advancement, I would be surprised if leaving industry to get a degree and then returning to industry would be more beneficial to you than another 4-6 years of experience and advancement in that very industry.\nSecond, most PhD's end up doing work quite unrelated to their graduate research. If your company wants an expert in something, then maybe they should just hire someone who has a PhD in that topic.

Articles published in the last 3-4 years will help you the most with getting a grip on the current state of the research, but of course classical papers can be of help too.\n\nI'd also suggest dedicating some time to making a plan. Work out a fairly detailed plan for the next month (I do this every month), as well as broad, general plans for six months, twelve months, and the rest of your degree. It took me about 2 days to really plot out what I wanted to do, and the long-term stuff does definitely change, but it still helps to have a sense of direction.\n\nMotivation is something most PhD students struggle with, and one tip I have in that department is to do 2 solid hours of work at the start of your day. Sit down at your desk and do 2 hours without distractions - no Facebook, no tea breaks, nothing. Then take the rest of the day at whatever pace you like to, because you'll get so much done in those dedicated few hours at the start. Also, take weekends as much as possible.

I'm a computational mechanics PhD (recent graduate!), I never get to talk much my work. I'll give you some quick answers to your questions:\n\nSome overview about what computational sciences are: It's very different from software engineering. Knowledge about software building definitely helps, but it isn't the core skill. It's basically an amalgamation of physics or specialized subject area knowledge (biology, chemistry, entomology, etc), applied mathematics, maybe statistics, and  computer science. \nWhat it involves is looking at an observation in nature, and modeling it (describing it) with physics, statistics, or mathematical tools. What this does is you've converted a vague real problem into a mathematical problem that you can now use mathematical tools to solve. What are you solving for ? Depends on your observation. Did you observe that ants were always swarming around sweet food ? You can model the swarming behavior of ants as a function of sweetness of food mathematically. Now the solution of that math equation tells you the swarming behavior of ants.\nThe thing is that most natural observations are incredibly complex. Used to be that you could use many many assumptions and make the problem easy, so that the results of the physics analysis was easy to solve (well not really easy, but lets say possible for humans to solve.) Like with the ant example, you could say that all the ants ONLY move in 2 dimensions (no height). Easier to solve but leads to results that may have limited use (ants may climb on each other which isn't explained by your model). BUT with greater computational power, what you can now do instead is model your problems with less assumptions, which leads to more complex equations. Equations that cannot be easily solved by humans. So instead you use concepts of applied math, mainly numerical methods, which can give you approximate solutions. Problem is that these methods require a TON of computations. So what do you do, let those damn robots earn their pay. Send it to a computer and let it crunch the numbers. Problem is, some of these equations are SO complex, it takes clusters of computers months to solve a problem (see fluid dynamics). Here you you can use your creativity in computer science to develop faster algorithms, your understanding of applied math to come up with better numerical methods, and your subject matter knowledge to change the model so that the solutions are feasible but also accurate. So, please do make sure you understand what you're getting into. Software engineering is (atleast in my belief) a very small aspect of Computational science.\n\nJust to answer your questions:\n\n\n1. Email the students, email the profs, don't worry about it. We love talking and procrastinating on our research. Be respectful, do your research on their research first. Check the professors website and learn what they do before you contact them. Maybe read a paper or two from their group (google scholars or ^^scihub )\n\n2. It's great, pays pretty decent, you learn a lot of skills that are applicable in many industries so you have job security, the research jobs are challenging and satisfying, the non research jobs pay well. You will have job security (lol if nothing else you can always go back to the software engineering field with all the numerical computing knowledge)\n\n3. This may count against you. My advice: Do a masters program first with a thesis option. Good universities generally give assistantships which comes with tuition waivers and stipends. Might be a good way to get to know the field and build research experience.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7wxy2i/software_engineer_wanting_to_pivot_into/ducri96/"}, "234": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PM_me_good_Reviews", "Date": 1518818750, "Score": 1, "Body": "No hurry, take the time to investigate your dream more thoroughly.

Now I have this permanent tie of negativity to anything data related and it sounds like you might have the same sort of thing with writing. Once you form an aversion or strong dislike for a certain work task I think humans tend to default to only reinforcing that connection and aversion.\n\nI hate to do analysis, so I get stressed to do it. The stress means I make little progress, so I get more angry. I know what is happening and this makes me annoyed that I can't fight it...

When you say you hate yourself when it comes to writing it sounds exactly the same as when I get stuck in my data-self-loathing loops.\n\nSo for me, what helps is identifiable goals to fix things, writing can be super intimidating because of the sometimes perceived \"total freedom\" that comes with it. It's easier to work to a direct goal compared to \"Go do work\" and sometimes the act of telling th scientific story can feel too open and undirected which means that rather than consider only the relevant, you get stuck on the idea of thinking not only about EVERYTHING that can be included, but you also start to stress about EVERYTHING minus 1, that must be excluded.\n\n(EVERYTHINGx2)-1 = A lot.

Those that do get these positions are very competitive (e.g., several journal publications, other significant achievements), and the vast majority of new TT hires are PhD graduates from top-ranked universities. Maybe try to gauge how you compare to the competition at this point as part of your decision making. Also, because of the very high demand and low supply, many TT jobs in the social sciences pay more poorly than you'd think starting off, like 45-65k USD.\n\nThus, most PhD recipients now find employment outside of academia, but even this is becoming oversaturated, especially for many non-technical fields. And more than 1/3 of all PhD recipients do not have any kind of employment immediately after graduation.

Nothing working? Sounds about right.\n\nIn my experience, so far, you need to talk to other students and see that you are all in exactly the same position. \n\nI recently went to the doctors because of no sleep due to stress. In the end what i needed was 2 days off for a long weekend where i did no work and played some games. (I also have defence in april and report due in 2 weeks). \n\nI recommend taking a day or two off and doing no work just doing your hobbies or similar. My girlfriend and i always have nintendo switch games and a puzzle on the go nowadays so we can both escape phd stress in the evenig.\n\nTalk to others on your course about how they are doing but admit you are stressed. There are two types of phd students but hopefully not all the ones you know are the ones with massive egos (in my institute i find about 85% seem to have massive egos and are increadibly good at dressing up zero results but when i watch their talks and dig deeper i realise not only is my project harder but i am doing better, i suspect you will find the same).\n\nI mainly want you to know you arent alone. 2 weeks ago i had a whole week of stress induced headaches because of everything i had to deal with it. I think part of a PhD is experiencing this level of stress so next time you can recognise it and recognise how you came out the other side.\n\nPersonally i went to see my gp when that one happened because i literally couldnt remember what i was doing at work i was so fatigued. He has taken blood tests etc but actually just sleep and doing something completely outside work is what i needed.\n\nI promise you are not alone and it is ok to have had stuff that doesn\u2019t work. Remember your thesis committee meetings are for you. They want to see you are trying and you are doing work. Word all the questions in such a way that you can get advice from those listening. While they may be assessing you they are likely assessing you on very different criteria than you believe. They will not get rid of someone that shows a willingness to work and learn and you show that.\n\nI fully understand what you are saying though i am dreading telling my boss i am leaving academia as i dont want to disappoint him.
