You're in a great spot because you've just started. \nHaving a weekly chat is extremely helpful in making sure you're on the right track and allows you to channel your efforts better. Your advisor will also point you into directions (esp literature) you wouldn't know of as you start. \n\nWhat can work really well is if you give yourself a few goals every week and ask your advisor if they would be open to discuss how you were able to tackle them towards the end of the week. Being specific always helps - tell them you would like to discuss x experiment, y paper, z analysis etc in your email. Follow up and schedule a zoom appointment beforehand. \n\nIt's important to not set massive expectations too and just let things go as they are with your weekly progress. Not every week will bring massive success but it is essential to keep rethinking your plans and trying new things and your advisor can definitely help with that. It's just important to do what you think is best and try to discuss it as often as you can. You will have confusing discussions at times where you're both left scratching your head, sometimes you'll disagree too - it's ok and completely normal too. It's a part of the process and a lot of things eventually do get sorted. \n\nAdvisors not replying is very common. It is most often a result of an overloaded inbox where emails get lost and unattended. It happens to me as a senior grad student at times too. But you can develop ways of tackling that. \n\nIf you want to schedule an appointment, try to send out an email ~ a week in advance so that way if they don't reply you can send them a polite follow up. Usually a couple of those and they'll figure out a time. Doing this a few times will build a rhythm and it'll get easier. You might even end up having a regular meeting time after a few discussions.\n\nOnce you start discussing your work, it'll be encouraging for both of you.

My friends who wear a hijab face this way more than I do, plus the overt racism you get from the general public. It's not discussed within academic circles in countries like the UK because it makes people uncomfortable.

This was very slow due to the process of the university and having to get approval for everything I was doing and writing. To fill my free time I volunteered to help as many people as I could with their projects. Initially, this was great because I was offered authorship on papers, learned new techniques, became acquainted with faculty outside of my committee and supervisors. But then things started to add up. Projects began to overlap just as my own work was ready to start. I now went from doing not much to working from 7 am to 11 pm nearly every day and this lasted 4 months before the projects wound down. I paid the price for this with serious burnout and depression. So there is an upper limit on what you can be doing. \n\nI tell you this as a cautionary tale that while wanting to take on more work can be great, just make sure you are not taking on too much. If you are looking to do more work, start working on a literature review. It works because it gets you familiar with your field, can turn into a publication that you can always reference, and in some cases can be used as the first chapter of your dissertation. Best of all, if your schedule does start to pick up, you can just stop working on the review.\n\nBut I would say that you should enjoy this downtime. Read books on broader topics, think about designing a course, take long walks if possible, get in contact with other professors; or, familiarize yourself with the expectations of your PhD and any specific dates you need to know for your program. Still get your work done but if there is no immediate time crunch, enjoy the freedom while you can because I am almost certain it will not last long. \n\nI hope this helps", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/laba1u/should_i_be_doing_more_what_am_i_supposed_to_be/gln3fjk/"}, "142": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "normabelka", "Date": 1612209981, "Score": 10, "Body": "This is what I plan to do after defending.

The title of \"Dr\" has a long history, and medical professionals have appropriated it from those with PhD's.

This is why most people, ignorant of usage in professional life, academia, and even pop culture (think of \"doc\" used in who knows how many shows and/or movies referring to scientists), take umbrage with the title. Beyond this,  the other part of the stink over Jill Biden likely concerns the fact that she has a professional doctorate, not an academic one. Generally, medical doctorates are the only *professional* doctorates which garner the title  \"dr.\" in pop culture (with people especially being skeptical of professional doctorates going by the name in alternative medical fields, like physio or chiropractic, where, you work in a health related field ostensibly, but are not an M.D.).   \n\n\nAs far as PhDs go, universities and colleges commonly use \"dr\" to refer to their faculty with earned PhDs. But if you have an earned phd, and are not doing academic teaching or research in the field, it might come off as a bit pretentious.   \n\n\nMy $0.02 would be that it isn't all or nothing. There's a difference between calling yourself \"Dr. xxxxxx, Ph.D.\" (some people actually do this!) big and bold on a business card, and having your phd listed say, under your name, along with other qualifications. If you seem to be hiding it, however, people might suspect you're ashamed of it. I'd put it where you'd put any other qualifications, make it clear and obvious, but just don't necessarily go by Dr, or make a habit of referring to the fact that you have a phd!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lb5lh6/very_mixed_feelings_about_using_my_phd_title/gls7lyq/"}, "257": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "littlemissbones", "Date": 1612301158, "Score": 3, "Body": "ahh i\u2019m in my second year and i\u2019ve just started trying to set my goals like this, with a lot of success so far! glad to know it worked for you - and congratulations on your graduation!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lase7v/depressed/gls85qb/"}, "258": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ThrowRA_XwantsTalk", "Date": 1612301561, "Score": 3, "Body": "Hey!

It's great that you have a wife (I wish !), especially if she helps you.  \n\n\nAnother few ideas I had on the spot : \n\n\\- The website \"[helpguide.org](https://helpguide.org)\", which is great for you and also people around you (on how to help you/dealing with the burden a condition may be, ex. \"[helping someone with depression](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/helping-someone-with-depression.htm)\").\n\n\\- Music helped me a lot, I could find my emotions expressed there. (Rachmaninov, scriabin, shostakovich...).\n\n\\- Mindfulness is great, too, but maybe that you won't find the energy (though it could provide quick relief). There's a great book from Penman Williams, \"Mindfulness in a frantic world...\". It's like a sport, you really need to do the exercises (it's an 8 week program, which takes about 15 min a day), but it can transform your life. \n\n\\- Do you do sports ? It reallllly helps, too. Even just getting out for a walk. \n\nTell me if you have anything else to ask !

The thing is that he came up with the idea to create this PhD position (in which I have been selected) because he learnt that this topic is in very much demand and it has a potential to bring many projects in future.

Professors know they can support you but you can decide to go somewhere else.\n\nFor example, one of potential advisors I had when I started thinking about doing a PhD.

My two cents as I'm ~6 months from finishing my PhD in an engineering field (so take this for a grain of salt):\n\nMy experience is thar working towards a Phd is just a job. It's not necessarily more valuable or even more difficult than other jobs in the same field; if you set regular goals and a consistent schedule to meet milestones, the level of work itself is probably comparable (from what I witness from my husband who is in his career with only a BS in the same major as me). However, there are a lot of good/bad factors that make the pursuit very divergent from just entering the workforce. Your mileage may vary for a few reasons. \n\nWhy a PhD is Hard (in my opinion):\n\n1) You absolutely have to self motivate. Especially in the Work From Home era, you need to be completely capable of holding yourself accountable. That's not to say you won't get an advisor who may want to micromanage, but generally I feel like an advisor won't want to have to hold your hand the entire time. \n\n2) Working with an advisor can be difficult. Pursuing a PhD is different for everyone because it seems every program at every school has different requirements, so there are a lot of nuanced opinions about the \"correct way\" to do a PhD. Some professors are more hands-on, some more hands-off. Learn to understand what you need to be successful, and don't try to fit into a style that isn't right for you (for instance, I discovered very late that I am more successful with a more hands-on advisor, but my previous advisor was hands-off). Advising is difficult on both ends because personalities are different and have a large effect on whether it's effective or not. \n\n3) Timelines are fickle and sometimes things just don't work. Experiments fail, software licenses lapse, global pandemics shut down labs. These are setbacks that can be demoralizing at best and debilitating at worst. Sometimes an advisor or committee member expects more work that takes more time. This is pretty unique to a PhD because other career choices are either on a strict timeline OR \"permanent\". A PhD is a quasi-indefinite unknownness based on only being done when satisfying vague and subjective requirements. \n\n4) Money. Getting a PhD does not necessarily mean making lots of money even when you're done. Fellowship applications can be annoying. But, obviously, if you're serious about a PhD in your field, you're not doing it for the money. \n\n5) You may get sick of something you think you love. Getting a PhD may make you hate the field you pursue. This is not always the case, but in my experience, as much as I know I love what I do, I currently hate it. \n\nThings I love about PhD program:\n\n1) I do love what I do and I know my work is meaningful. \n\n2) Especially early on, it seemed like everyone I met /worked with was super interested in helping me succeed. Other PhDs love talking about their work, from which you can learn a lot. \n\n3) Opportunities. I was able to teach a few classes, attend international conferences and research events, work in cool labs, see neat things, meet amazing people. A PhD is an education that, should you take full advantage, gives very unique and truly wonderful tools and experiences. \n\n4) Flexibility*. Grinding is frequently necessary, but generally you control your schedule. You don't have paid vacation, you don't generally clock in /out (at least I don't), so if you need to take a day, you can take a day. Sometimes, being able to work on your own schedule is a huge mental health savor. \n\n*obviously taking classes, approaching deadlines, working internships, etc are NOT going to be super flexible. Also, be responsible and accountable with your flexibility. \n\n5) (Hopefully) The ability to work in a high level field of research or education that you find fulfilling. Also being able to say \"I have a PhD\" must be pretty cool because telling people you are working towards a PhD is usually highly regarded. \n\nOne of my advisors reminds me every time I go to him with woes and tears: \"It's only a PhD.\" This sentence changed meaning over the years.

If you want to be interacting with Human patience in a medical capacity, an MD is a plus. There are also grants that are only available to MD holding applicants. You are certainly a rarer commodity. \n\n Furthermore many academic research departments at top tier insinuations have both a clinical and basic science branch, so MDs or MD Ph.Ds are the preferred department chair credentials (but not always because there are fewer and fewer MDs in research) because of the need to understand clinical medicine.\n\nMake no mistake, if you want to practice medicine and do research, it requires an immense commitment.

Bad news, the stipend ends when I drop (I knew that) but since it ends my waiver ends and I now owe the university the pro-rated tuition which will come out to roughly $4k since I'm out of state.

Ironically 6 years later I found a way to leverage my research to land a promotion and grow my income by 50%.\n\n\\-What made you forgo a lab position?\n\nLab was all about technical work and I knew there had to be more to life than that. I wanted to solve big, real world problems experienced by real people. I also wanted to work with people. My lab experience was very solitary in a building without windows.\n\n\\-How do you find a good mentor?\n\nYou find someone who got the results that you are after and find ways to be of service to them. Don't ask them to be your mentor but seek to add value and ask for advice. Be mindful of their time. You want a mentor that is busy but productive.\n\n\\-How can you best utilize your mentor beyond their experience and contacts?\n\nWell, for me it always boils down to results. If the mentor was successful in getting consistent results that i am interested in, then i want to know how they did it and get feedback on my approach. Some of my experience was with mentors. Most of it was with coaches. In fact my first mentor opened my eyes to the fact that all olympic athletes have a coach. I found this to be very productive. \n\n\\-In your opinion, what does work-life balance mean to you?\n\nIt boils down to priorities at any given chapter in life. Right now i have a newborn so my priorities are with her. I am also at a place that I choose to work less. Having flexibility to set my hours and work less comes later in a career. Usually the first few years are busy as you are focused to prove your value and establish yourself as a credible authority. \n\nWhat does an ideal work life balance mean to you ? What would you be willing to compromise to get it ?  \n\n\\-Do you regret anything about your career so far?\n\nI wouldn't call it regrets but rather contemplations on alternative course of reality. I sometimes wonder if getting an MBA could be more productive than a PhD. It took me 3 false starts to find a lab where i ended up doing my research. What if it took me 1 ? I could save 2 years but then I wouldn't have developed the resilience I did.\n\nI think the career path I chose was a very good fit. At the end of the day it is a very subjective and very personal decision and requires some soul searching from the person.\n\nI'm not sure why, but the following questions seem to be frowned upon on reddit when I ask.\n\n\\-If someone were to be focused 100% on salary, what's the best rout to take?\n\nProbably Quantitative Finance or Investment Banking. They have some paths for folks with quantitative PhDs. I considered going this route but after speaking to some people who did that chose not to pursue it. We become the average of 5 people who we spend the most time with. I chose a career that is consistent with my values and goals in life. \n\n\\-Typical salary depending on position and years of experience?\n\nI am not really interested into typical. When i approach something, I start from the result I'd like to get and then i find someone who has done it consistently in the past and model them.  I know multiple people who started from 6 figures and 5X-ed their compensation within 5-6 years. Do the math.\n\n\\-Are annual raises around 4%? higher/lower?\n\nReally depends where you are in terms of industry, the profitability of the company, your personal performance inside the company. 4% sounds very safe. \n\nMy observation is that if you are in the tech industry (big companies) and considered top 5% performer, early in your career you can double your comp in 1-2 years and then again. Personally, I would rather find out how to model that behavior than aim for the standard annual raise. Of course this also has to do with the fact that equity is a big component of compensation and stock markets did well over the last decade. Lots of factors here, but my fundamental focus remain the same: model the people who are getting the results that you want.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ld6n0u/are_there_specialized_forums_subreddits_for_post/gm5vh0i/"}, "763": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CuriousJojo2000", "Date": 1612560556, "Score": 4, "Body": "before you find jobs, you define what is your dream job. \n\nWhat do you want to be doing ?

This will help strengthen your literature review.\n\n\\- Literate programming: org-mode and org-babel. Lots of information out there so take your time testing it out. I've also used Rmarkdown and Rstudio because that's where I started before switching to emacs.\n\n\\- Agenda and project management: org-mode and org-agenda. I've also used PassionPlanner for the weekly view, and I get to color in time blocks, but Google calendar works just fine (you can link it to your org-agenda using org-gcal). Look up time-blocking as a time-management method. It really helps clear your mind that way you don't have to think about what you need to do next during the week.\n\n\\- Writing: check out org-roam, which is a decentralized way of writing and note-taking. Think of it as your personal wiki. org-mode is a great way to write your reports/papers/dissertation, and you can export the file into any format (word, pdf, HTML).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, I'm more than happy to talk about them.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ldbzim/tools_to_organize_your_research_especially/gm8y64c/"}, "887": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "pseudodoxia", "Date": 1612634193, "Score": 2, "Body": "My advisor says that you're only cooped if the conversation stops.

Your postdoc clock, though, is running short and half-assed.  \n\nFor the latter individual, I mean taking a sabbatical from med school is bad enough to my understanding, but with it being so many years out it sounds like he's never finishing.\n\nAs far as I can see, the success of getting in *and* going through 4 additional years of medical school after 5-7 years of a PhD is, by itself, a daunting challenge.  Let alone getting in.  \n\nPersonally, this seems like a big gamble.  The PhD might help, but the degree alone isn't going to make up for MCAT scores, shadowing, and the like (one of the people I earlier referred had apparently attempted multiple times and still couldn't get in).  And given the amount of time you need to be actually competent as a PhD student, I don't know how one would properly balance all of this.

Again, that's 5-7 years of intense work just so that you can spend an additional 4 years of med school and 4 years of residency.\n\nIs it because you're looking to increase your chances at a faculty position?

He might think he has a good reason for making you miserable or putting so much stress on your relationship, or that it\u2019s temporary. But it isn\u2019t and it won\u2019t be. Life as a post-doc is just as stressful and time-consuming as being a PhD student. If he doesn\u2019t realize this quickly, he will burn out, put an incredible amount of strain on your relationship, or both. \n\nYour husband should be helping with the cooking and the cleaning. He should be planning at least some of the activities you do together as a couple. And when he spend time with you, he should be fully present - not thinking about his work. \n\nA PhD program is stressful, but the work he is doing is never more important that your mental and emotional health, or your marriage. He might be overwhelmed but, at the end of the day, he is also acting selfishly. \n\nI know because I did the same thing. I struggled to find a work-life balance, made unreasonable demands on my partner and her time. I justified it by saying I was doing it for us, but I was doing it for me. We broke up, and when I met my current partner I resolved to do things differently the second time around. \n\nMy partner and I have turned cooking into a hobby and a way to enjoy time with each other. No matter how busy I am, I still have to eat, right? I also do a lot of the cleaning, because it gives me time to think about my writing. That\u2019s something they don\u2019t give you in a PhD program: time to think. \n\nInterestingly, taking time out of my day to do things around the house has made me more creative and more productive. I generally enjoy my work more when I have an hour or two to step away from it.  \n\nI would talk to your husband, be honest about the sacrifices he\u2019s asked you to make and the unhappiness you feel. Point out the very real risk of burnout. Explain that a healthy work-life balance will make him more creative and productive, as long as he genuinely commits to being present when the two of you spend time together. \n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, stop letting him treat you like a maid. Ask him to take responsibility for some of the chores and cook dinner 3 nights a week. Encourage him to talk to his colleagues and mentors about developing a proper work-life balance. \n\nThe good news is, every PhD student goes through something like this with their partner. And many of them find ways to make it work. The work he\u2019s doing is important, but you are important too! Don\u2019t forget that! \n\nI hope everything works out.

I see tools / knowledge as a mechanism to make progress towards your goals.  Different roles would require different skills.

If you are build a new imaging reconstruction algorithm then numerical optimization is useful and if you are doing anything with data analysis, ML toolkit is a good idea to have ready. I don't perceive what you describe as a gap. I started from the values: in my case these are service, creativity and aggressive growth. I set goals in a way that pushed me along the dimensions of my values : e.g. i made a goal to get promoted in &lt;18months which if successful would put me in the top 5%. I knew that to do it, i'll have to be creative and to serve the people around me (customers, peers, partners, manager etc). If I take all this action that i'll definitely be growing agressively.  Now once the goals are clear, the tools are secondary: i used whatever tool was available. if i didn't have the tool, i obtained it. If it didn't exist, i created it.\n2. Unless you are going for a research role in the industry which is direct extension of your research in PhD, nobody cares about your publications. I didn't even put them on my resume, i just mentioned i have X of them. It really has to be tailored to the role. One common mistake i consistently see reviewing resumes (4000+ and counting) is that people make the resume about them. The resume is about results and how these results helped you build skills and gain experience that would make you productive at the new employer. A resume is a sale. You are selling the employer on the idea of interviewing you. it has to be written accordingly. Every bullet has to be crisp as bacon to make you want to read the next one ([example](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1B1VPqRTfMsHt4XEWiOHFSDS4OBb7WbbY)).

Don't know where you're based but academia is going through a rough time at the moment, and it can be difficult to secure employment in policy depending on what your topic is.

If research fell through, what sort of policy area would you want to work in? Form a topic around that subject historically\n2. Shop around at universities and meet with supervisors to suss out whether they will fit with your goals. There are lots of terrible supervisors out there who can derail your thesis. If possible reach out to former students of theirs (the academic supervisors usually have a list of supervised students on their staff page) and ask what it was like working with X.\n3. Apply for scholarships before getting into the program. Once you're in, a school has less incentive to give you funding\n4. Create a network while you complete your dissertation by going to conferences, meeting other students etc. Try to ensure your work is relevant to present day policy issues and try to attend some industry conferences to expand your network and set you up for when you graduate\n5.

Don't rely only on postdoc positions and don't assume the PhD alone will help you get a job. I don't know what your field is, but in general, international students are at a disadvantage when looking for jobs.

I sent 200 pages of blood, sweat, and tears off to my advisor, and I was completely devastated when I got his first round of comments/edits back. I read through them once a few minutes after they were sent, and it took me a solid week before I was ready to even think about confronting them again. Took a big hit emotionally that day, and I think it\u2019s normal to feel that way with something you spent so much time and energy on. I think it\u2019s important to ruminate on things a bit, let them sink in but also let yourself feel the sting\u2014after all, you\u2019re only human. That contemplation period is important, it lets you feel what you\u2019re feeling without letting that disappointment or indignation colour your edits. Things are much more productive when you feel ready to do it, instead of forcing yourself to grin and bear it, or letting indignation steer you wrong in your editing. It may seem counterproductive to take time and distance yourself like that, but from personal experience, I think our writing is much better for it, and we work more efficiently when we\u2019re not battling ourselves. Like any other kind of disappointment, it just takes time to cope with it.\n\nThe truth is that every single reviewer and every single writer have their ticks, preferences, pet peeves, and quirks. This makes for edits and comments that can seem really unceremonious, undiplomatic, and insulting, and I think at that point it\u2019s really important to try and take yourself out of the writing a bit. Like someone else on here said, it helps to take the ego out, makes it a bit less volatile.\n\nI also think it can be comforting to know that this is something that every single grad student goes through\u2014it means that most of us are developing into scholars in our respective fields that are willing to take criticism and collaborate on something to make our work worth writing (and worth reading!) sadly, most of us will have to deal with criticism and comments on our work that we don\u2019t agree with, and this is probably good preparation for that.\n\nI get what you mean about impostor syndrome, though. I was convinced that I would never pursue a PhD after my MA, that I wasn\u2019t cut out for it. But I was encouraged by faculty and ultimately ended up accepted to a few top-tier schools around the country. I don\u2019t say this to brag, I use it as an example of how the impostor syndrome we all live with can be a vicious liar. I genuinely didn\u2019t think any school would take a second look my work or my application materials, and I was proven wrong. Impostor syndrome convinces us that we\u2019re uniquely unqualified in comparison to our peers, when in fact (according to my therapist) it\u2019s an extremely common phenomenon in academia. Most of us know this, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel that way. I think it helps to be reminded that this stuff is part and parcel of what we do, and that we\u2019re less alone and less incompetent than we realise.\n\nAlso, I would echo what others have mentioned on here\u2014it\u2019s actually a good thing that your advisors are willing to spend time reading and revising your work\u2014it means your work has potential and they want to see it in its most polished form. \n\nI would also say that I think you can simultaneously understand that you don\u2019t know everything and still be disheartened at the comments you get on your writing. Being disappointed at the amount of comments you get doesn\u2019t mean you think your writing is perfect\u2014that disappointment is a totally normal feeling, don\u2019t let others tell your otherwise. A lot of times, that\u2019s the impostor syndrome rearing its ugly head, telling you that you should have known better and anticipated someone\u2019s objections in your first draft. It\u2019s an impossible standard\u2014it\u2019s a first draft for a reason.

Instead keep that in mind and say it to yourself, make believe yourself that you'll never do that again.

Many out there are suffocating because of not getting a good approach and appreciation from their Prof. Also, you at least have an upper hand than others. Maybe it's not a competition (I don't know) but I'm sure, many don't have a clue what to do, no progress or any idea! :(\n\nSo, think about that and cheer up and work hard from now! trust on yourself and you'll do great! \n\nOh and regarding the solidify the ideas- sometimes adding more ideas from literatures helps. Relate with each other a bit more, how they are connected and gives your idea a bit stronger base. And lastly, I want to say that many think that a PhD student is at the beginning of a maze and the supervisor is in a helicopter seeing the end of the maze. But that's not true. The supervisor and student are both at the start of the maze together. So, sometimes they also can't give you a clearer idea what to do, and can't tell what to do.

A PhD is a huge challenge. Main challenge being how to assert yourself, pursue an idea and believe in it, and convince others to believe in it too.\n\nI just passed my quals last month. And it really seemed anticlimactic. It's tough, but I know it's what I want to do. --Even harder during covid! I'm willing to say ~50% of PhD students have some kind of mental health thing going on (myself included). I think they're a double edged sword in way, parts of our upbringing have led us to be incredibly successful in narrow areas of interest which lend us to be incredibly resourceful in these areas. Then again, there's a significant personal cost that goes under the radar. Just some context, my diagnoses include Asperger's, complex PTSD, generalized anxiety, major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, bulimia, and alcohol use disorder. It's a lot of baggage to carry, yet I try to see how it's shaped me into the person I am now. Despite all the stress that carries along, I realize that I would be pathologically bored if I were anywhere else.\n\nTherefore, my advice to you is to specifically investigate University resources for mental health and disability in your search. Doesn't hurt to inquire, and I wish I did a better job at this. You don't have to disclose specifics to your department,  but usually the University has other departments and policies in place to protect students when needed. Next I might add, look at the health insurance policy! I didn't know how helpful the insurance would be well into my program. My out-of-pocket max is $1200/yr which I usually meet within two-three months, everything from there comes at zero expense. It's been a lifesaver knowing the most I will ever have to pay for healthcare is $1200 a year! The department itself will never be able to meet your mental health needs, and that's where investigating the other resources becomes helpful.\n\nThat aside, the next thing you want to look for is what the department culture is like. Student culture will always be more important than any research you want to do. You'll be able to find interest in almost anything despite what you're thinking right now. I even switch labs halfway into my second year to do a completely different project because I found the PI and the lab culture to be toxic. It can be done!\n\nI'll also add that I did a tech job for two years before doing a PhD. I found the experience to be endlessly valuable. It gave me some extra cash too; more than a PhD would. It gave me good experience and I formed great professional relationships. I'd highly recommend taking a stab at this first. It also enhances your resume for when you finally apply to grad school.\n\nAnyhow, there's many ways to embark on a scientific career. You can do industry, or post-bac programs, anything that allows you to learn new things and meet people. And don't worry about the stipend! University to University, it will always be more than a living wage pegged to the cost of living in whatever city you're in.\n\nBest wishes!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lkyiep/some_advice_whats_phd_really_like_are_there/gnmpb52/"}, "2197": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "NaClQueen", "Date": 1613468659, "Score": 3, "Body": "I'm going through this rn", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lkl2w2/we_try/gnmqox7/"}, "2198": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MallGroundbreaking32", "Date": 1613470823, "Score": 1, "Body": "Physical activity and getting some sun seems like a good go-to.

There's some great advice here already and as others have said one of the big things is to limit the technical details and minimise the words on your presentation. I like to think of the presentation as an advertisement for the paper, so use the presentation as an opportunity to really bump up the main point of your paper and those who are interested in the technicalities of it will want to read it (or ask questions). If you have something really technical to cover you can also consider having a \"light\" version in the main presentation and a backup slide or 2 with the \"heavy\" version if you get questioned on it further. \n\nAlso PRACTICE! That's the big one a lot of people forget and you can always spot a presentation that has been practiced vs one that hasn't. Just reading over the slides isn't enough either, spend at least a day before in front of the mirror rehearsing and make sure you keep track of time too, conference presentation timings can be pretty strict. Warming up on the day is very important as well. Tongue twisters are great for warming up and you can mutter them under your breath while waiting to present.\n\nOne of the best resources I've used for both writing and presenting is the official TED Talks guide ([https://www.ted.com/read/ted-talks-the-official-ted-guide-to-public-speaking](https://www.ted.com/read/ted-talks-the-official-ted-guide-to-public-speaking)) which gives some really good advice on the order to present your items and how to keep the audience focused, even through complex topics.

The hard part of the work is done :) I'll try to give some general tips which I received prior to my viva and which I found helpful while defending the thesis, but I'm not in your field (I'm in industrial engineering/business) and also not in the UK, so feel free to disregard this if you feel like it doesn't apply to you.\n\nI had my viva in December, and the best advice I got was that you should be prepared to be able to apply some of your findings and conclusions to some aspects outside of what you have looked at (more speculative in terms of, \"based on that I saw Y when studying X, I would consider the following aspects to likely be important in the context of Z\"), and not always just reply with \"That's outside of my scope\". This shows that you can translate some of your analysis/findings outside of what you have been studying, and shows your reasoning skills. *But* if you get questions which are completely outside of what you feel comfortable with, you can often answer by refocusing the question to an area where you feel comfortable (for example, if the opponent asks \"Why didn't you use method X?\", and you perhaps don't know method X that well, you can say \"When deciding what method to use, method Y (which is the method you used) made more sense due to the purpose of the project being Z, which is why I decided to use it instead of X\" (obviously with more details, but you get the point - this allows you to show your reasoning and knowledge, without having to talk about a method that you might not know that well)). Another important part is not being defensive, but also not just accepting everything, so always being polite (duh) but if you feel like the opponent is criticizing something you think is the appropriate choice, don't be afraid to say so (\"I see what you mean with X, but since the scope was to do Y, I believe that using the concept of Z was suitable, as it provided...\"). That is the \"defending\" part of the thesis defense ;) Most importantly though - enjoy it, if you can. It's a special moment, even if it's nerve-racking. \n\nBest of luck!!

You should be able to demonstrate the thinking process behind your work and show *very clearly* where the contributions to advancing the knowledge in the field are. Everything you wrote should have a purpose in either supporting an explanation, or giving context.\n* As much as possible, ensure there are no silly mistakes (grammar, punctuation, double words, wrong indices, etc). While most of them would probably not be picked up, if they do get picked up it doesn't look good. Also, ensure references are correct and complete (include DOI numbers, ISBN, etc) and links still work. Since you already submitted, if you discover any mistake it's worth pointing it out before the examiner does.\n* Be flexible and don't go in the viva expecting things to go by a script. It helps to check who the examiner is, read some of their most cited papers, and most importantly try to find a recording of them speaking. That way you know what tone and body language to expect from them.\n* Last but not least, **have fun**! You worked very hard for this, you are among the few experts on your field in the world and you should be proud of that.

It sounds very similar to my situation, starting in the summer and running into this past fall term and into the new year. I've always had a good relationship with my supervisor, but she did notice that my work was slipping over the past 6 - 8 months. Her reaction was to try to set up timelines and due dates for deliverables. It didn't work for me because I was having a depressive episode. I began to dread my meetings with her because I knew it would involve her being disappointed with my lack of productivity. I finally has a break down during one of our meetings and admitted that I felt I was in a depressive episode. I cried to her despite wanting to put on a positive face. This changed things. She immediately began brainstorming with me how we could take the pressure off while I recovered my mental health. We looped in the associate dean for the PhD program so that I could know all of my options. There turned out to be many ways that I could slow things down and take off the pressure, and everyone was extremely understanding since we're living in difficult times. I'd say that having the pressure reduced really made a big improvement in my mental health.

I like games meant for relaxation but are still mentally stimulating on a low level (instead of just listening to ocean noises). A good example is Monument Valley (played with sound on). \n\nTherapy has been crucial, as has time management, prioritization, and the ability to let go of perfectionism.

I highly recommend Amazon\u2019s subscribe and save program for consumable product needs and especially as that applies to non-perishable ready made food items. There are a lot of options around the $2 per meal and &lt;$1 per snack price points that can be found (before the extra 15% discount for the program is applied). Good options are either immediately edible like protein bars, protein cookies, fruit leather, and nutrition shakes or super low preparation (usually adding water and putting it in the microwave then throwing away the container when done). These types of options include instant oatmeal cups, Mac and cheese cups, various Asian noodle bowls (way more options out there than just types of ramen), pasta pouches, and rice pouches. Lots of flavor options in all these example items. Because they are shelf stable there is no guilt if you don\u2019t eat it all right away and specific items or whole orders can be cancelled on a per delivery or forever basis.\n\nFinally, I recommend examining pain points and outsourcing as many as reasonably possible.

I can't really tell how things are for PhDs in Computer Science. I will focus on what I have some knowledge, but remember that I'm still a student, there is a lot I don't know about the job market.\n\nI don't remember seeing people from CS as marketing professors, but I met people from other fields. There is one professor I know with a PhD in Economics. He was a professor in Economics but didn't get tenure because what he was doing was more related to marketing than to economics. So, he was kinda forced to move to quantitative marketing. And there is another professor I remember with a PhD in Physics, but he had to do a postdoc to be able to switch to marketing. \n\nSo, I think it's possible to get a job as a marketing professor. But I think it should be much harder than for someone with a PhD in quantitative marketing (and it's not so easy even for PhDs in quantitative marketing).\n\nA few potential reasons for that:\n\n1 - Yeah, CS applies to data science. But why would you be a better job candidate than someone who is doing a PhD in quantitative marketing? \n\nAfter all, in a lot of cases, quantitative marketing is data science. So, it's not like you're offering something schools are not able to find among those with a PhD in quantitative marketing. With so many PhDs in quantitative marketing, schools would need a very good reason to hire a PhD in CS instead. \n\nSo, you need to think about your competitive advantage, something that would make you stand out compared to those with a PhD in quantitative marketing. \n\n2 - People may really wonder if you know the differences between quantitative marketing in industry and quantitative marketing in academia. \n\nYour work experience seems to be industry-related. You probably don't know much about what's going on with academic marketing research. And, by doing a PhD in CS, you probably won't have the same chances that we have to learn that. \n\nA lot of marketing professors are quite skeptical about people from industry. So, if you try to sell your marketing experience as something similar to what we do in academia, you probably will have a hard time doing that. Even for PhD applications (it's no wonder that usually work experience is not really relevant for PhD applications). \n\n3 - Support to get a job. \n\nIt's hard to imagine that a CS PhD program will be able to give you the same support to get a job as a marketing professor. For example, things like networking, letters of recommendation, conferences, and teaching evaluations will probably be weaker for you than for someone in marketing. After all, they probably will be related to CS, not marketing.\n\n4 - What you describe as \"cursory additional understanding\" may be more relevant than you think. \n\nMarketing is very interdisciplinary. Even if your research is not focused on those \"additional understanding,\" you are usually expected to know about many different things. \n\nProbably the most important example for quantitative marketing is psychology. Yeah, we focus on data, math, that kind of thing. But data often can show how people behave, but not why people behave that way. Even if I'm in quantitative marketing, not consumer behavior, I should still be familiar with the consumer behavior stuff. Using just data is typically not enough to advance marketing theory.\n\nAnd psychology is only the most obvious example. My journey so far has taken me to places that I would never expect, like research in History. \n\nWe are expected to explore possibilities. If we just do what everyone is doing, it's much harder to make a significant contribution to the scientific knowledge to be published. Digital marketing, for example, is something that has been extensively researched by now. I see people talking about the streetlight effect. Since it has been a lot easier to do research related to digital marketing, there has been a lot of research about that, creating a bias in marketing research. Of course you can still do research about digital marketing, but you must bring something new and relevant to the table. Just the same old data analysis probably will not be enough.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lnv8qi/computer_science_phd_for_career_in_quantitative/go3mgbe/"}, "2773": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "DeepSeaDarkness", "Date": 1613807417, "Score": 7, "Body": "I don't know what a dba is, but a PhD is forever. \n\nIt can be revoked though if you're guilty of scientific misconduct or misused your title.

Something I didn't include in my post is that I currently am leading a small research project in quantitative digital marketing and have active connections with some respected academic research working on relevant projects and publications. These connections have approved of my research directions and methods so far and have encouraged me regarding its value in securing an eventual PhD admission at least. I know that industry will not help me in most professor positions, but I brought it up because it will help guide me in navigating my marketing specific research if I do a CS program.\n\n1. I don't think the CS will make me a specifically better candidate for marketing academic positions, but I do think it will make me personally a better researcher for my specific interests and best compliment my current skill and education sets for at least my current project (and so presumably my future dissertation area). My hope is that being a better researcher and so having a higher chance of finding impressive results. That is what I hope will make me a better candidate.\n2. CS will certainly not give me the same overview of all research, but I am lucky enough to have a good research network and a natural enjoyment of reading journals and absorbing this info through other means.\n3. This is an excellent point. Evaluating how strong my out of program connections will be at the time of graduation is something to consider. Why would teaching evaluations be lower though? Just because they would carry less weight from another college? Do you think my graduate marketing courses would help mitigate this at all?\n4. Cursory additional understanding is based off my current academic background with both undergraduate (I took way more undergraduate courses than average.) and graduate level psychology courses for degrees before PhD application. Could my understanding be higher? Always. But, none of the programs I'm currently considering in quantitative marketing have much more than a cursory focus on topics specifically within consumer behavior. Is human psychology a factor in digital marketing? I'd argue it is in most everything, but it is simply added insights not core curriculum from the conversations I've had with individuals working with my preferred programs. \n\n\nI will certainly consider and further investigate the suggested possible bias in marketing research. I feel that my specific interests are certainly not exhausted because they involve regular significant changes/updates. It's honestly a surprising statement to hear, so I'm glad I've been exposed to it. To me, it's like saying that the topic of engines has been extensively researched by now so there is a bias.

I had a dream of becoming a researcher in psychology when I was in my teens. I wanted to focus on topics close to neuro-, cognitive or social psychology. Back in the they it felt like there is nothing else I could imagine myself doing. Even though that was the case, I wasn't keen on topics related to personality or childhood development. Things related to those topics were always the things I \"he'd to study\" rather than things I wanted to study. \n\nNow that I'm older I tend to think that I could be a happy statistician, biologist or sociologist. It's not psychology itself that attracted me, rather certain topics that are researched also in different fields.\n\nDo I wish to work in psychology related topics in the future. Yes, but not in the way one might imagine. I'm a licensed psychologist, although I don't want to make a career out of it. I never had the passion for clinical work and if I had I'd probably be working as one at the moment rather than doing my PhD.\n\nI do like learning about complex matters in a more theoretical level. I could still see myself being a researcher in the furture, but that isn't my goal either. My dream job could government (national or municipal level) and it would be related to things like legislation or how the scientific knowledge could better be utilized when making changes to things like social security system. I do think that psychology has a lot to offer on these topics but at the same time the topics aren't purely \"psychology\".\n\nTo me pursuing a PhD is a way to take a set towards the career I want: I get to dive deeper into the topics I wish to work with in the future as well. It's straight out 4 years of working experience, which can't be bad in the long run! Graduating as a PhD in Psychology on the side is just an added bonus.\n\nMy PhD is fully funded, since my topic is somewhat \"trendy\" (meaning that the government and it's agencies have been eager fund research related to my topic) and I get monthly salary around ~ 2 700\u20ac (The median salary in my country is around 2900\u20ac in my country).

Things might be different for different people.\n\nI think the weirdest thing for me is related to this part: \"none of the programs I'm currently considering in quantitative marketing have much more than a cursory focus on topics specifically within consumer behavior.\"\n\nFor coursework, I agree. I just had one course on consumer behavior, and that course was quite broad (and therefore superficial, as we can't dig deep into everything).\n\nBut for the program itself to dismiss psychology like that seems really weird to me.\n\nEven the most heavily quantitative professor here often emphasizes the importance of that. Hypotheses are usually based on consumer behavior, even if we test them quantitatively. The foundation of our research is usually related to consumer behavior, even if our methods are quantitative. Model development typically should take into consideration the theories that come from consumer behavior. Explanations of surprising results often rely on consumer behavior/psychology. Among other examples.\n\nLet me give you a more concrete example about something that happened during a presentation here. Someone was presenting the results of a quantitative marketing research. Then, one professor asked why the model didn't include one variable that should be relevant according to consumer behavior/psychology. And the presenter said that, unfortunately, they didn't have that variable in the dataset. So, the professor said that, in that case, they had an issue with omitted variables. And omitted variables are a known source of bias, making the results they were showing not reliable. So, I don't see psychology as just \"added insight\" as you said. If the psychology behind your data analysis is wrong, flawed, or incomplete, then you may have a huge issue that invalidates your results.\n\nThis is probably one of the most important differences I saw comparing my experience in industry with my experience in academia. In industry, they usually don't really care about the psychology, alternative theoretical explanations, things like that. As long as things work for them, that's great. Sales increased? Yay! What are the psychological explanations behind that? They don't really care that much. In academia, typically we first expect things to make sense from a theoretical perspective (including psychology) and then we go for the quantitative side.\n\nFor a more extreme example, p-hacking is quite common in industry and people usually don't care about it. But, in academia, people can get in real trouble for that (e.g., Brian Wansink). And that's a discussion I see mostly happening with quantitative people now. That, without that foundation from fields like psychology, quantitative marketing researchers might just be p-hacking.\n\nSo, to me it's weird to see something that looks critical from my perspective be considered cursory by the programs you contacted.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lnv8qi/computer_science_phd_for_career_in_quantitative/go61ik1/"}, "2878": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "The_Woman_S", "Date": 1613862371, "Score": 1, "Body": "Same!!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lobr5e/the_need_to_be_productive_100_of_the_time/go624if/"}, "2879": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "yinyinyin", "Date": 1613863538, "Score": 3, "Body": "Yo man.... +1 here too.

In fact, it has probably tainted some of my understandings of the program\u2019s breadth for others and been making me miss out on valuable insight about possible resources and value. \n\nI have typically started my conversations with contacts at various programs I am interested in by giving a brief summary of my research direction currently and assumptions or sticking points. I\u2019ve definitely asked in a wording like \u201cdo I need to be involved with many aspects of consumer behavior\u201d? Rather I may in the future ask \u201cis consumer behavior a big focus of this program\u201d which would have given me a more accurate and expansive picture.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to go into too much detail for a more comfortable level of anonymity, but my research interests are pretty entrenched specifically in data involving only sellers and selling platforms (B2B web based exchanges and algorithms). So, consumers are important but data is mostly not likely to have inputs from them in a micro or macro level. It may sound too specific a topic, but there are just so many digital marketplaces out there and so many interesting factors.\n\nIt\u2019s also good to know that my most relevant industry experience may be really novel even for how I classify it. Only a small and recent part of my career has been in agency and I heard a lot of comments about agency careers in undergrad that may have been highly inaccurate. The agency I work for is moderately sized and recognized as fairly successful. We only do digital marketing right now. It has both a data and more general research overall focus and approach (at least since I\u2019ve been there). This is pretty well entrenched in the company, and I\u2019ve always just taken this for granted as standard for marketing agencies in general. Like, research tasks and sharing things I learn have sections on my employee review. Consumer behavior is a topic that matters there and I can think of plenty of frequent tasks and discussions on it from various people and departments. Honestly the company really has reinforced that \u201cwhy\u201d is a crucial question. An example on this any agency (or even large sized internal division) should care about is plotting changes in revenue against changes in market share. One of the big reasons for this combination is to investigate why sales might have increased. Did a big competitor suddenly drop off for the month we raised? Don\u2019t over tax resources for inventory purposes then because either there is smaller chance of additional growth bumps of that size or a strong indicator of no repetition. Even if the competitor\u2019s account might have be unable to sell temporarily due to some of the most common factors. Alternatively, all relevant brands bumped up similar this time period. Evaluating risk here for losing rank to less competitive selling velocity vs understand the possible major market trends absolutely needs a closer look at consumer behaviors.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lnv8qi/computer_science_phd_for_career_in_quantitative/go6axa5/"}, "2885": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Youonlyliveonce1979", "Date": 1613867600, "Score": 3, "Body": "I just keep thinking positive and I set realistic goals.

If research fit is very bad, they don't expect to be able to help you. And, if they can't help you, there is little reason to accept you into the program. \n\nResearch interests are also very important because they are related to your motivation to do a PhD. For example, why do a PhD given your work experience that seems to already deal with those interests? Depending on what you say, they may conclude that you would have a better chance of doing what you want to do by staying in industry instead of moving to academia. And then a PhD wouldn't be a good choice.\n\nBut, after you are accepted, you are usually expected to be open minded and flexible. You never know what is going to happen, uncertainty is very high.\n\nAs a professor here said, research is an unusual career where failure is the standard. Many of the things we try to accomplish fail. We may run experiments and fail, we may run the data analysis and get a lot of insignificant results, we may try to publish and get rejected, etc. \n\nDiscovering something new, relevant, and with strong evidence isn't easy. Even professors are sometimes forced to change research interests depending on many factors. One of the full professors here shared his experiences about that last week with the faculty and PhD students, as he is having difficulties with some of his research interests. \n\nAnd professors are also faced with situations in which they need to get out of their comfort zones. That happened recently with my advisor, who is really an empirical quant marketing guy and he had to write a paper that is more theoretical (no data, no equations, etc.). He said it was one of the most challenging papers for him.  \n\nSo, doing a PhD should help you to become a researcher, and not just to help you to research your interests. And that often includes expanding horizons and adjusting to new conditions, sometimes unwillingly. \n\nIt's not like they are not going to help me with my research interests. But that will happen later, probably after I graduate. For now, there are other things I must do until I get to the point that I can deal with my own interests.\n\nAbout the decision of \"which school/advisor to pursue,\" I would say that your advisor is an extremely important decision. Your advisor is really the one who will define what you will do during your PhD, and that can be quite different from the rest of the department, school or students. If you really want to get into the CS stuff, your advisor is the one who will tell you if you gotta do that or focus on something else, for example. \n\nAbout programming, it's good to have some knowledge, to know what you're doing. But I don't recommend you to get too deep into it before you start. For example, if you learn a lot about R but your advisor doesn't know anything about R, you probably will need to learn something different again (depending on what your advisor uses).\n\nAbout math, I really recommend you to be very good at things like matrices and derivatives if possible. For example, doing a regression using a software isn't a big deal. But doing that using matrices isn't so easy, specially when the professor is going at full speed and you don't have time to stop and really think about what's going on. I admit I'm not so good at that kind of thing, and that still causes me problems.\n\nIf you take some courses for that, you don't need to limit yourself to marketing groups. In the beginning, I felt like I was doing a PhD in Economics instead of Marketing. I went to the department of economics to take courses on statistics and econometrics, for example, the Economics PhD students were a great help. Also, all new students started with a course from the department of finance.

So giving up on meat is posssible and feasible. Asking people to not reproduce and start a family, is just too extreme. Using that logic, using smartphones also has enviromental impact. Heading out of your house and using public transport also has environmental impact. And like this, all of our day to day activities cumulatively have a huge impact. Should we just give up on everything then and stay at home? And yeah, may be some people are privileged enough to have all resources they need at walkable distance or inside their building.

Also, let's not forget the environmental impact it would have had in the first place to bring all those resources right to your home.\n\nBesides if you think that bringing a new human causes so much emissions and is the single worst thing one could do, then by actually being alive we are continuing to have an impact on the planet just like the child would have once it is born.

You filled your taxes because you have an income that comes from Canada. But it's not equivalent to what citizens pay in their lifetime in taxes... Have you applied for residency or will you apply for residency in Canada following your studies? \n\n\nTechnically international students only pay more for Public universities (most Canadian Universities are public). These institutions receive up to 70% of their funding from the government (aka citizen taxes). A Canadian citizen will pay for up to 35% for the marginal tax rate if you make something like 52k a year throughout their life (obviously tax brackets are different based on income, and tax rates will vary by province (Qc having the highest tax rate of the country iirc, but also the cheapest tuition for residents)). This happens even if the resident or the resident's family has not set foot in a single university. They pay taxes for all the services anyway.  This is sort of the Canadian's socialized responsibility to provide for others. In short, domestic fees are subsidized. \n\nWhy should international student get the same tuition as residents when they, or their family, haven't contributed in their taxes prior to being admitted to the school, and when there is no guarantee that they will stay and continue to pay taxes after they finish their schooling? \n\nAdditionally, if you compare international fees in Canadas (minus UofT), it's actually not that expensive compared to other countries (re: US). I calculated the Concordia tuition for international students assuming A&amp;S department and full-time status, and it came in at $ 12,817.92 tuition + fees + health insurance for fall semester and $ 11,641.92 for Winter semester, which comes in at about 24, 459.84$ for a full year (residency excluded)\n\n\nIn comparison, if I take University of Arizona the tuition is 39,847$ for out-of-state residents (also excluding residency).  \n\nCanada still comes in cheaper. The gap is simply bigger, because Concordia's yearly tuition for residents is about 3000$ whereas UofA is at around 10k$ for in-state residents. (but the tax rate in Qc is significantly higher as well. In 2005, the tax rate for all revenue in Qc was 44% https://cirano.qc.ca/files/publications/2005s-18.pdf). \n\nI guess the difference is that international students don't pay the same taxes that Canadian Residents do. Even if they fill yearly tax income for each year that they are in Canada. It doesn't make up for the 60+ years of taxes that Canadian residents and their families pay to the government.\n\n(I will not talk about UofT because UofT do their own things)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lptlim/it_sucks_to_be_an_international_student_in_the_us/goer3vp/"}, "3160": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "RuinHaunting6650", "Date": 1614044315, "Score": 5, "Body": "Totally relate, sending money home really is our reality, thought it was only me", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lptlim/it_sucks_to_be_an_international_student_in_the_us/goesbd1/"}, "3161": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lowrankcluster", "Date": 1614044416, "Score": 3, "Body": "The only good thing about PhD in US is the qualified professors and research funds they are able to collect.

And I asked them the same thing: didn't you know about the job market in the US and that being an international will put you into a disadvantage( I knew it since I started to apply). Then, if you still chose to pursue this path, you knew you were still getting something out of it. And that from the point you started ( middle-class in a third world country), it in itself is a privilege to be able to do PhD in the USA for full-funding. I could barely afford the \"ticket\" from my home country  to States from my own \"budget\" and this is true for 95% of population in my country. In my country, education itself is a privilege, and  most people cannot even afford to go to schools/ universities there, let alone think of getting a scholarship to pursue top degrees abroad, especially the USA.\n\nI guess the problem starts when PhD students start thinking of the scholarship as \"immigration\", and that's when they start to get ungrateful and compare themselves to the nationals. The comparison isn't even necessary in the first place. The fact is that neither your ancestors and nor your parents are \"legal citizens\" of the nation and just like each country in this world, the US also favors its \"nationals\". So the comparison is totally unnecessary. And if the motivation to pursue a PhD abroad was to run away from their home countries, then they can always look for other opportunities abroad. USA is not just the only developed country in the world. With an American PhD, you're employable in many countries and can choose to settle in Canada, Australia, somewhere in the Europe and UAE.\n\nIf you choose to return to your country(even for a few years), it won't really harm your life but it will benefit the lives of hundreds and thousands others who will learn from your knowledge and become motivated to pursue their dreams. Sadly, in my country, people are so helpless that they have stopped \"dreaming\", they think they will never succeed. And within this darkness, you can become a beacon for them(even if it's for a few years). Personally, I come from a family background where affording education in my home country was so expensive, let alone coming abroad. It was indeed a dream come true that I got the fully-funded opportunity and some of the people who became a source of inspiration and motivation for me were those with American PhDs who had returned to the home country to \"serve\" and \"inspire\" young students like myself.\n\nSo yes, recognize it as a \"privilege\" in the first place and then seek your options (immigration to another developed country, work visa in various countries, serving home country etc.) before comparing yourself to the \"citizens\" of this land.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lptlim/it_sucks_to_be_an_international_student_in_the_us/gog95nx/"}, "3241": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Careless_Wrangler_90", "Date": 1614081659, "Score": 1, "Body": "Exactly THIS!

It's a really tough process, and I can see now why it ends up discouraging a lot of really brilliant candidates. You mention that you're still completing your masters - kudos you for managing to push through applications (in this of all years!) alongside studying, because it's a tough thing to balance and you should be proud of yourself for persevering. Plus, this year is hugely competitive in terms of postgrad degrees and funding, so rejection doesn't mean you're not capable.\n\nI think there's a lot of pressure for people who are interested in doing a PhD to push straight through the system and get it all done as quickly as possible, partly because you're still 'in the zone' immediately after finishing a masters.  A lot of candidates take some time off to work, and a lot of the time it ends up working in their favour - which is probably what they mean by 'more years of experience'. In my case, I decided to take a break after my masters and work for a couple of years, and now I feel 100000% more confident in my abilities now even though I've been out of academia - I've spent much more time researching my topic and coming up with an angle that could attract funding that I also find exciting. Also, I'm not sure what discipline you're in but in the humanities (my area) a lot of funding opportunities rely on candidates being able to write for a non-specialist 'general audience' - one of the supervisors who I worked with on this round said that she thought this is where my time out of academia could be really useful, because being a bit rusty meant I would be less likely to get wrapped up in jargon and subject-specific essay stylisation - so there are some practical advantages to getting out for a little while. \n\nOn what to do next with the applications: do you have any peers/know any current PhDs who would be willing to take a look at your applications? I found this kind of feedback to be really useful in some cases, only because they were able to spend a bit more time on it than prospective supervisors. If you're keen to work with the same supervisors next year, it is definitely worth keeping in contact with them, but if you've found any supervisors to be frustrating or unhelpful then it might be worth looking for other supervisors in similar areas that you may want to work with instead - they'll also have a different perspective on things, and could spot issues that others didn't - this could end up improving applications across the board!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lq2ob5/europe_phd_application_rant/gois7km/"}, "3341": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "superkirb8", "Date": 1614122786, "Score": 1, "Body": "NGL I would have paid a lot more attention in class if my professor had a sword.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lqe5bu/hey_i_want_a_sword_too/goisanz/"}, "3342": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TheSavageAnarchist", "Date": 1614122946, "Score": 1, "Body": "You do you and you'll feel most comfortable, its your topic, its your work, nothing is stopping you from being you, best of luck &lt;3", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lqmc0g/tomorrow_morning_is_my_phd_defense_i_feel_like_i/goismea/"}, "3343": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "adlzanchetta", "Date": 1614122992, "Score": 3, "Body": "Oh, what is wrong with York U?\n\nI had no complaints about the US institution where I did my masters, not about my instructor or colleagues.

But of course, this is just my experience and yours might be completely different. \n\nI suggest you look into these things for your particular research area and context.

Presumably, your ignorance is  why you're asking the question. Firstly, a \"PhD,\" is not just a thing like getting a license or certification, the process differs significantly depending on field, sub-field, personal project, specific school, country, etc. Some European degrees are quite concentrated, streamlined, and short, some North American degrees require years of coursework and comprehensive exams before even becoming a PhD candidate. Even with potentially short programs, however, the question becomes the success of the research and planning. What happens when a project you've been working on for months fails and becomes a dead end? Your time-span pushed back a term, or two, or maybe an academic year. What happens when you realize your project is bigger than you thought and will take more time? the same thing. You can't know going in, that's part of the process.   \n\n\nThe fact of the matter is, in the vast majority of fields and places, a PhD does not merely refer to an idea you have and your research concerning it - that is the major product, to be sure, but in the humanities, the degree often involves coursework, exams, and teaching requirements even, and in the sciences (from what I know) you are part of a \"collaborative\" team of researchers working on a host of projects in labs aside from your own. Additionally, when someone does a PhD, they enter into the philosophy and structure of a whole cultural approach to higher education (whether geographically, or locally at a school) which involves a whole lot more than only you and your idea.   \n\n\nAnyway, some programs are streamlined. In the humanities, because you can (but shouldn't ideally) work isolated, some programs are dissertation-only and can be done in 3 years. An 7-10 year PhD should not be the norm at all, and while it happens (esp. in the humanities) it is usually the result of a host of challenges which force the student to proceed part-time. That's unfortunate, I wonder about many student's preparedness, but life happens. Most PhD's fall somewhere between 3-6 years, and the shorter end of that would be an ideal to strive towards in terms of coherence and momentum etc. but it is not always in the student's control.

In the United States (and this is different in Europe) STEM fields, the first two years are classes, picking labs, seminars, TAing, and preparing for the comprehensive exams. \n\nThe following 2-4 years are the research part of the process. For those years, you are researching something that has never been studied before. This is relevant because when things don't work, you have to troubleshoot it yourself, because no one else has ever done it before; I'll get back to this in a minute. Additionally, you're normally applying to fellowships, serving on committees, and (in some programs) TAing. \n\nThen comes the writing the dissertation portion. Writing it takes some time; plus, each chapter defines a project that you would probably consider your normal two year project. Dissertations historically have five chapters: one intro, three research, and one conclusion. So, if you have three research chapters and each takes about 2 years, we're hitting 6 years now. Of course, you normally stack projects so that you're not in scho for 10 years.\n\nAs if all of this isn't bad enough, you're also doing work that has never been done before. To use an extended metaphor, imagine that we're trying to raise the surface of human knowledge by building towers and filling in ditches between those towers. Filling in a ditch is easy: you can see what other people have done and have a pretty good idea of where your project is going to go. Towers are harder to build, but as long as you're building them in a tower cluster, you can compare stone work, copy design, have it done in two years. For PhD research, we're building a tower in a place that has never had a tower before. I don't know what stone to use, I have to learn all about the foundation, I have to figure out the weather patterns so my tower doesn't fall over. Did I mention that I don't know how to build towers from scratch? That last one I built I just copied all the ones around me and made a really good tower. This one is new! I have to figure everything out. When then wind blows it over, I have to learn about physics and resonance and weather. When I get to the windows, I have to learn how to put glass in that will fit the conditions of where I'm building my tower. And I'm not a glazier. It's hard and building the tower is a lot of work and I'm teaching myself techniques the whole time. When I ask for help, everyone's like, \"I don't know. I've never built a tower there. Good luck!\"\n\nMoving away from my metaphor, I'll just leave you with this. I'm getting experimental results back on Monday. Those results will fundamentally change how some stuff is seen in my entire field. It will potentially change treatment plans for patients, it will change science for people who work on my stuff, and it will change out basal understanding of the basics of my subfield. \n\nThat's the difference.

For some departments you have a clear goal (like reaching 40 publication points, and pubs at certain journals may give 20 points and lower journals might give you 15 or even 10) and then its only down to you getting the publications that sum up to the target. At the other extreme you have social sciences at ivy leagues, where you basically get the PhD once you get hired at another university as a prof. This could mean with 3 publications or with only working papers - but really interesting ones and is much more dependent on how you are being perceived in the field than objectively tied to a metric.\n\nOn the research not working out part - there certainly is a tension between having it count towards your PhD (in the end, you worked hard for it) but also not giving it too much credit (research with interesting/important results just matters more). Plus, spending more time on the onset of a project makes it more likely that a project will yield something, but of course you can do everything perfectly and still get null findings. But from what I see in our department, this is one of the reasons why PhDs take between 4-6 years - most PhDs are smart and work hard, but you cannot underestimate luck.

Now it's really up to you to absorb that they told you. \n\nSo, I'll just confirm and comment on a few things other users wrote. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The time one needs and the amount of work one get done depends so much on your research field.\" \n\nYeah, you need to see how things work in your field. Probably more than that, how things work for the type of research you want to do. My speed is quite different from some other students in the same department. For example, if you have a lot of control over the project, things can be much quicker. If you have an easy access to the data or other resources that you need, things can be much quicker. Among other examples.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"then you can discount the first 2 for classwork\" \n\nIn my case, the first year was really focused on classwork. There were classes in the second year, but I started doing some research.\n\n  \n\n\"There are typically lots of responsibilities that don't advance your own work at all.\"\n\nYeah. I think we need to think of doing PhD as a job, where you need to juggle many different responsibilities. Including ones that won't help your research. That can include teaching, organizing events, assisting in other people's teaching (e.g., grading exams), assisting in other people's research projects (e.g., collecting data).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat happens when a project you've been working on for months fails and becomes a dead end?\u201d and \"This is relevant because when things don't work, you have to troubleshoot it yourself, because no one else has ever done it before\"\n\nAs a professor said here once and I often tell people here: failure is the standard in research. We fail at many of the things that we try to do. Our experiments may fail, our data analysis may not get any relevant results, our papers may be rejected, etc. \n\nJust coming up with a research idea that is accepted can be a huge challenge. Anyone can have ideas, but probably your advisor will not accept the vast majority of your ideas. There are tons of reasons for that. For example, it's quite common to find that your idea has been explored before, that your idea lacks relevance (theoretical relevance, managerial relevance), that you lack resources (and I mean resources very broadly here, as resources can include money, time, human resources, equipment, among other things).\n\nYou may need to come up with 10 research ideas until you have 1 accepted. And, for each idea, you will need to read the relevant literature, learn about the methodology could be used, what resources would be required and how to get them, etc. \n\nAnd when we have a research project, we never know what results we will get. After all, if we knew things in advance, we would not need to research them at all. We just do research because we don't know. \n\nFrom what I see here, it's quite common to be forced to throw away a whole project, even after months of hard work (sometimes years). People hoped the project to work, but after trying to make it work in multiple ways, there is no relevant result, not enough to write a paper about. \n\nWe hope things will work, but we don't know what will be necessary to make it work. We may need to learn a lot of different things to see what might work, what might solve our problems. \n\nWe may read a lot of papers to see if you can find the theory that helps, but most things you read probably won't help. We don't even know where to search because the answer may be in a very different field (and understanding papers from different fields is usually much harder). \n\nWe may learn a different methodology or language. For example, I spend a lot of time trying to learn the coding language/software that my advisor uses. But that software wasn't the best one to use  for my current project. There is another software that has a package that is better suited for this, so I had to learn more about this software. The same thing happened in another project.\n\nWe may need to do a lot of additional analyses that we didn't expect when we started the project. \n\nOne of the issues is that there are always more things you could do to improve your paper. If you do too little, then your paper is not good enough. You can't use it as part of your dissertation, you can't get it published. But if you try to do too much, it may look like the project will never end. \n\nSo, you will need to stop at some point. But usually the program has very high expectations about that. You can't just do a master's level paper and hope to graduate with that. \n\nAnd, oftentimes, if you can make your papers better, you want to do that. Because the better results you show, the stronger you will be when looking for a job. It's common to see people choosing to take more time to finish the PhD (even if they could already graduate).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lsxnff/outsider_looking_in_im_interested_but_i_dont/gouwk4n/"}, "3698": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "chk171", "Date": 1614362752, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you!

I think people who do PhDs are relatively privileged and we shouldn't pretend like what we do is on par with what paramedics, stockbrokers or firefighters do. \n\nIn my view, people who select PhDs 1) like the content matter, 2) are looking for an ego boost via the prestige, 3) are inadvertently repeating a pre-existing pattern of trying to please someone who can never be pleased and/or 4) had nothing better to do, or all of the above. (If you think I missed a reason, feel free to comment.)\n\nI'm also willing to bet that PhD students score higher in neuroticism and lower in openness to experience.

Specially when those mental issues make them think that a more traditional career wouldn't work for them. \n\nPhD programs also attract many people who are very smart, who have done very well before getting into a PhD. People who are considered achievers, perfectionists. And those people can have a very hard time when they hit a wall. It may be the first time in life that they are not among the best in class, it may be the fist time they are not able to solve a \"basic\" problem by themselves, among other examples. Then, it's easy to see impostor syndrome developing. It's hard for many of them to keep believing they are smart when they get low grades, it's hard to keep believing that they are achievers when their projects don't get any meaningful result, etc. \n\nIt seems also pretty clear that there are departments and faculty that are very toxic, and that can lead to mental health issues. I met some professors that I certainly wouldn't like to have as advisor. Things would be a lot harder if I had an advisor that that. \n\nAll of that in a context that, as you said, is not a walk in the park even for those who are content with it. Even when things are going well, doing a PhD is often associated with long hours of work, a lot of uncertainty, being overwhelmed with information, facing failure, working alone, not being understood by people outside of academia, moving to another city/state/country, struggling with money, etc. \n\nSo, if things are difficult even when they are going well, you can expect things to be too difficult when something makes that even worse. Even if those things are not directly related to the PhD process, they can push people beyond their limits. Like, I'm doing a PhD in Texas. Since I got into the program, I had to deal with the hurricane Hurvey, the pandemic, and the winter storm that almost froze me (and some people in the department, and some of the students of the course I'm teaching). So, if doing a PhD by itself is not walk in the park, it was much harder when it was not a walk in the park but in the middle of a hurricane and a winter storm with no electricity, no heating, no water. Not fun. \n\nAnother issue is that many people apply to PhD programs without knowing what they are getting into, or why they are getting into this. For example, I see people thinking a PhD is just like a long masters, or just another degree. So, their decisions about getting into a PhD are based on wrong information or wrong expectations. Then it's natural to see many of them struggling with the unexpected reality. \n\nNow, if we randomly chose bachelor students to go into PhD programs, I think the issue would be even worse. Because doing a PhD would make no sense for a lot of them. A PhD is hard, but at least we chose to do this for some reason. But, for a lot of bachelor students, that's not what they want to do, that's not going to help with their life and career goals, they have no research interests in mind, they have no motivation or passion for this. \n\nAnyway, mental health is an issue. Whether that was caused by self-selection, the PhD process, or something else, mental health during a PhD is still something we should all care about. My experience has been quite positive, I am someone who is better prepared to deal with stress and pressure than most. But I know it's not like that for everyone, and I try to support people who are struggling. Thinking about the causes is relevant, but thinking about dealing with the outcomes is more of a priority for me.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/luosqa/causal_question_is_it_the_people_choosing_phds_or/gp8l2l4/"}, "3982": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Sea_of_colors", "Date": 1614552391, "Score": 3, "Body": "Haha that's amazing!!
