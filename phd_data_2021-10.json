I have 0 idea how he even passed his defense or did 3 years worth of research under a year,  but I suspect his supervisor wanted him to move on (it's not in the US, so offering a student to master out is harder as they already got a master).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I am aware of those reasons and my question is not really why you can't fail your defense.

In my country you have X requirements to fulfill and 3 years to do it - you figure out the order yourself and if you fail to meet the deadline that's your problem and you should've made a better plan (though at least my university always works hard to get people back on track if issues are noticed).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pzqxon/phd_in_the_us_vs_uk_vs_europe_vs_australia/hf2pgrl/"}, "358": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ZWF0cHVzc3k", "Date": 1633162734, "Score": 18, "Body": "Based on most comments, seems like having a dog is a necessity in doing a PhD .", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pzkurt/what_does_your_day_look_like/hf2psv6/"}, "359": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nujuat", "Date": 1633163110, "Score": 1, "Body": "I use Zotero, but i mostly \"chose\" that because my supervisor uses it and we can share stuff there.

Check if your specific field and programs of interest really work as you describe. \n\nWhen I decided to try doing a PhD abroad, I also compared different countries. I decided to do it in the US, and I certainly don't regret it. \n\nSome of my reasons for that (which are not necessarily valid for everyone):\n\n\\- I certainly wasn't ready to start doing PhD-level research right from the beginning. The jump from a masters to a PhD is insane. I started doing research with my advisor while I was still doing coursework, there are people in my department that started in their first year. It took me a long time and a couple of research projects to get strong enough to work on my dissertation papers. If I only had 3 years, I don't believe I would have strong results to show. Even 5 years are often not enough, specially if one wants to get papers published by top journals. It can take a long time to hear from then, and you probably will need to make several revisions. \n\n\\- In my field, US schools are usually much stronger, with few exceptions. It's not just about doing a PhD, but doing a PhD that will get the job that I want. At least in my field, what I often see is that those who did a PhD in Europe tend to stay in Europe, while those who did a PhD in the US go anywhere in the world (US, Europe, Australia, Asia). And the European programs that are really strong are often not short, being close to the US model. \n\n\\- Being able to teach during my PhD really boosted my profile, as I'm mostly targeting balanced schools. I'm in the job search process for a tenure-track position now, and in every interview they ask about my teaching. Flyouts include both research and teaching presentations. Having two commendations for outstanding teaching in my resume certainly looks better than having nothing. \n\nSo, maybe doing a PhD somewhere else is faster and easier. But if I was after something fast and easy, I probably wouldn't do a PhD at all. For me, helping me to achieving my goals is more important than being faster and easier. And US programs are better for me in that regard.

If you publish your chapters in a decent journal, present at conferences etc, you\u2019ll be ok either way.\n\nEdited to add: the way that Canada is half way between the two systems is that I still had one year of course work and comprehensive exams (which took 1.5 years in total instead of the 2-3 it takes in the US),  but I was not required to teach for my funding. I did end up teaching several courses because it was extra money and looks good on your cv, but it was far less than I would have been exprected to teach in the US. I was teaching THREE COURSES a semester during my masters in the US. That is basically a full time job right there. Then I had to squeeze my research in on top of that. It was a nightmare. In Canada I was teaching one course per semester, and only for the semesters I had the time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pzqxon/phd_in_the_us_vs_uk_vs_europe_vs_australia/hf3olbt/"}, "442": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dani_da_girl", "Date": 1633185725, "Score": 3, "Body": "You still have to do the coursework with a masters degree in the US.

Compartmentalizing the goals in your life (making time for your well-being, making time for your studies, making time for your hobbies, etc, etc) is key. I know it sounds clich\u00e9 to say that you gotta balance things out, but it is true. Try to balance it out. It\u2019s going to take time to adjust to this mentality and it\u2019s going to take time to practice it comfortably, however, do yourself a huge favor and try to heal yourself. Don\u2019t let a career make you think that that is all you. Your career goals is only a part of you. It\u2019s not all of you.\n\nThis is the mindset that I try to practice into my life.

A few were genuine questions, in that they weren\u2019t meant to have a distinct answer, but rather spark a discussion. \n\nIn terms of preparation, I subjected my group members and my boyfriend to more than a few hours of practice and questioning (they asked me anything under the sun). If you can get some non-experts, they can be an excellent source of fundamental questions that we often forget we have to be able to answer. I also wrote down the questions and their answers in a sort of master notebook, where I also distilled important textbook chapters and journal articles pertinent to my work. \n\nI had a situation where I had an inorganic chemist on my committee, where my project was very physics based. He asked some basic questions and was after analogies between my work and his. Knowing this is where he would go, I spent some time thinking about parallels between the topics and potential applications from one field to the other. \n\nRemember: you\u2019ve got this. This is, in essence a formality, your committee wouldn\u2019t have let you get this far if you weren\u2019t ready.

Go check out the **CVs** of the **relatively newly hired** (recent 5 to 10 years?) **faculty members** there. Did they all go to **Harvard, MIT, Cambridge**, etc?

Do you want to work in academia or just go to a private company or not-super-important government institution? I would personally go to the more prestigious program. PhDs are difficult. That being said, top programs are **not much more difficult** than programs ranked at 20-70. It might even be easier considering top programs have much more research support, maybe not by advisor but from the administration and more. Also keep in mind that most reviews are negatory. The research in the former program might be interesting now, but if, as you said the program's ranking is low and the research might not be very useful, then you might end up doing research that you don't enjoy for the rest of your career.

It isn't for everybody, and even then many of us who are okay working with some animals aren't okay working with all - for example, I'm fine with fish and small rodent work, but I couldn't do like cats or nonhuman primates (not that I think that work being done or the people doing it are bad, just that I don't think I would personally handle it well). Better to figure this out sooner than later.\n\nIf you really are ultimately okay with it, there are a lot of steps you can take to lessen the burden so to speak. First and foremost, stay detached - don't name them, don't spend time with them outside the bounds of the experiments, and don't get the same or similar species as a pet. Second, plan your experiments meticulously - this will be good for your science, but will also minimize the number of animals you need while maximizing the use/value of each animal. That said, science is science, so don't beat yourself up if something goes sideways, salvage whatever results you can and learn from the rest. Practice your techniques- this might feel at odds with the minimizing number of animals, but if you invest some extra time and animals at the start to be at your best later (dissections, collections, whatever), it will pay off and you'll come out ahead. You can also be strategic with your practice animals - for example, I have needed a variety of genetic crosses, and instead of the incorrect genotypes going to waste I try to use them for technique practice, training new lab members, etc - maximize the value of each animal. Finally, carefully consider and become proficient at ethical end point and euthanasia practices. While some experiments are not compatible with all methods of euthanasia, you can absolutely minimize the distress of your animals. Note there are also ways to remove yourself a bit - for example, when I was taught cervical dislocations on mice my trainer used her hands because it was how she was fastest and most precise. I didn't like the feeling though, so I learned to use a pen to hold the neck, keeping my hands not directly involved but still being swift and effective.\n\nFinally, contrary to some other advice here, unless there are staff whose job it is specifically to handle things for you, please don't try to pass on your work or just get others to do the unpleasant parts for you. No one wants to be taken advantage of, and being on good terms with your labmates is really important. Sure if there's a core facility or autopsy technician or something who your PI is fine paying to do what you need, by all means go ahead.

So they had a special protocol for decapitation which made it worse for her.\n\nI\u2019ve also killed mice for people if it wasn\u2019t too many and I had the time.\n\nPersonally, even though I never had a huge problem with it, it did make me feel better to do little things like I got this weird habit of saying thank you under my breath before using a cage; triple checking peoples protocols/design for them; and of course, after practice, being as quick as possible.

Experiments with algorithms are very fast to conduct compared with months or years in the medical case. Moreover, there are a billion ways to modify and create a new algorithm. If algorithms with negative results can be accepted, I can just think of any random one and write a paper?\n\nSecond, positive results do not really play any significant role, especially when you are submitting to a top journal. You can say your idea decrease the algorithm's running time by 68% blah blah blah, no one cares if your idea lacks justification/novelty/contribution. As an author and a reviewer, I have never been asked or asked about the positive results in any papers I reviewed or submitted. What I mean is that, if you have a mediocre idea with extraordinary results, it does not help at all (if you don't have good justification for the results). It may even raise more concerns about the integrity of your research. On the other hand, if your result is negative, or the improvement is insignificant, it will be rejected.\n\nA bit more on this matter, your advisor is correct for asking that question. He is not the one who conduct the literature review. He just speak from his experience. If something sounds too easy, there is a high chance that someone had thought about it before.

You could get that background with just a math minor as long as the minor included real analysis or advanced calculus. \n\nIn my previous lab (bioengineering), we had bioengineering PhD students with prior education in biology, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, physics, and a couple other disciplines. The only real requirement there was prior research experience in a lab environment and an interest in building stuff with cells.\n\nI'd say the most important thing from what I've seen talking with ~50 students and postdocs from engineering, math, and statistics is that you must show adequate preparation to do whatever coursework is required by the program you aspire to, and that you make a compelling argument for why you want to pursue research in the field you're applying to. Your advisors/letter writers can speak to some of that stuff if you communicate extensively with them. If you're seriously interested in applying to a specific program, you might also consider talking with a program coordinator or faulty member you wish to work with at that University. They'll have insights about what preparation you may need beyond what you've already done, and you'll become a name they look out for when reading applications later.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/q26fru/does_your_undergraduate_major_have_to_align_with/hfnz4ho/"}, "1256": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1633563181, "Score": 1, "Body": "It looks like your post is about grad school admissions.

Advices. There are a tons of cover letter samples online, as well as tips and tricks. You can read some of them to get a general idea about which contents to put in.\n\nHowever, your question leads me into thinking about the real purpose of cover letters in general. I believe that once you know what its true aim is, you will know what to write in there.\n\nIn my opinion, it serves 3 purposes. First, it should highlights the key/strong points of your CV, i.e., outstanding achievements, publications, etc. **that align with what the profs/recruiters/awards are looking for**.  Thus, you should find out which qualities they are looking for first, then write what you have that fits those qualities.\n\nSecond, it is the place for you mention the qualities that you have (again, must align with what they are looking for) **which are not presented in your CV,** e.g., some significant obstacles that you have overcome. For example, I once wrote that I published a paper with my sup while our time zones are like 8 hours apart, and we did it while having to work other jobs. I know this is kind of a weak point, but my CV then was not great, and thus I have not much to showcase. There are also other things like motivation to choose the field, etc. Nevertheless, I'm not really convinced about those kind of things. They are pretty generic, and most of the time you cannot provide any solid evidence about them. Remember, words are useless if you don't have any evidences to back them up.  For example, in your case, I can write that I would give my right kidney for this position, so that I can contribute to helping pets in the future. Noble? Yes. True? No one knows or can verify.\n\nThird, it shows your writing ability. Like how you organize your flow, how you write a sentence, vocabulary, etc.\n\nI hope you can write a good cover letter keeping these things in mind. Try to think from the prof's perspective. What will he/she be looking for in a student.\n\nI also hope that everyone else can share their ideas about this interesting topic.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/q4vkqq/advices_for_cover_letters_motivation_letter/hg2triw/"}, "1653": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1633851888, "Score": 1, "Body": "it depends.

Hard part is eating healthy on the cheep. Spend more time on inexpensive hobbies like hiking.   \nOther hard part no longer being in a position to support family.  Travel if someone needs help, etc. Even birthday gifts to nieces and nephews had to take a budget hit.\n\nSurprisingly dating my age group who are professionals are OK with my new financial situation. Something I worried about.\n\nDo you have time to work to make money?   \nMy university gives a decent stipend under the stipulation that you will put all your energy into your PhD training (classes, research, etc). The first year...NO way!  \nAfter that my PI is reasonable on me taking time off to work within my field or taking time for family emergencies. I took one summer off to work on COVID related engineering work in industry.\n\nI don't recommend trying to hustle on the side.  Be transparent with your mentors. For the most part, they are there to help you and will understand.  We have fellow PhD students with children, sick family etc.  The department will work with you if you are in trouble. In one case, I have seen a very talented student from China get his stipend bumped up when the PI found out that he was hustling on the side.  The PI invests in you doing research and would like to know if your mind is distracted with other work or finances.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/q5mlpc/phd_and_personal_finances/hg7alng/"}, "1779": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Mindless_Attention", "Date": 1633935474, "Score": 3, "Body": "Trying to procrastinate writing by reading a book on how to write?

A little bit about myself so you can understand where these opinions come from. I've recently begun my third year in CS. I'm doing pretty well atm (published 8 papers, submitted another 3, all first author in top journals/confs). Great and supportive supervisors. I've got enough stipends and awards/scholarship, so nothing to worry about financially. Nevertheless, I'm still stressed and depressed sometimes. Here are the pros and cons imo.\n\nCons:\n\n1- High chance a PhD won't increase your current income much. In fact, increasing income shouldn't be your goal when doing a PhD. There are many other and better ways.\n\n2- Can be very stressful sometimes.\n\n3- A good PhD experience depends greatly on your supervisors. In many cases, you got a terrible supervisor. Changing is possible in some cases, but troublesome and set back the progress significantly.\n\nThe following points only apply if you aim to be a good/excellent researcher. \n\n4- You will most likely conducting research for the rest of your life. Of course you might get a comfortable  teaching position at a uni without much research. However, particularly in a filed like CS, being like that won't get you far.  \n\n5- Workload can be very demanding.\n\n6- If you quit halfway, might be 3-4 years wasted.\n\n7- Requires decent intelligence. Can be partially compensated by hard work, but you can't push for the top without intelligence.\n\n8- Need a lot of self-motivation.\n\n9- Must learn most things by yourself.\n\n10- There are always someone better than you. And the worst thing is that, the more you improve, the more you realize how far better at research some people are.\n\n11- The beginning of the learning process might be very very slow. I know an excellent researcher who is now an editor of Nature with like 100 published papers. He told me it took him 7 years to know how to write his first good paper.  \n\n12- Researchers are not really appreciated, or at least fully understood, by the general public. Even my family and girlfriend do not  really understand what I do. This might lead to situations where they even add more stress to your life. \n\n13- CS is a trending field atm. It is very competitive. Most likely you will need to branch out to other fields too, e.g., applications of ML in medical instead of pure ML.\n\n14- The current publications system has many flaws, e.g., that obnoxious reviewer, and is unfair sometimes. But you will have to accept that.\n\nPros:\n\n1- Might be a very mentally rewarding experience sometimes.\n\n2- You are actually contributing to mankind's progress. Might even be something significant. Another Turing I hope.  \n\n3- You'll be more intelligent. At least the intellectual capability will improve. There are many technical things that I thought I would never be able to fully comprehend. Now, I'm fairly certain that I'm capable of understanding everything if I put in sufficient effort. And the more new things you learn, the faster you will be able to learn in the future.  \n\n4- I feel writing makes your thoughts more logical and organized.\n\n5- You can meet highly intelligent and brilliant people around the world. Plenty of chances of travelling (to conferences, seminars, etc.).\n\nI might add some more if I can think of anything.

I personally see the most amount of anti-PhD sentiment coming from the U.S. Maybe because of how doing a PhD is viewed in society. I come from India where again not much respect or money is to be made when doing a PhD and the only reason someone would do it is to join academia, so a similar sentiment exists in India as well.\n\nBut I am doing my PhD in Denmark and have some exposure to the systems in the Nordic countries (and the Netherlands and Switzerland) and my observation is that the systems here are extremely different than those in the U.S. Firstly, PhD is a full-time job, fully funded, you receive a salary (in most cases corresponding to the national average; anecdote - I am earning more or less the same compared to my friends who took a job after masters), a pension, social benefits like insurance and the perks of living in a highly equal society (Scandinavia). \n\nIn my field (material science/device engineering), getting a PhD is in general a great career move since many industries require specialists who are knowledgable in various synthesis, fabrication, and characterization methods. In fact, many industry jobs seek out and have special perks to attract PhDs since there's a dearth (foreigners with PhDs are offered special tax incentives to join as a postdoc/research scientist since there aren't enough locals to fulfill the demand). So in my case, doing a PhD made extreme sense (also personally I always had been passionate about research). SO I just made the right decisions in terms of choosing a field where my skills would be actually in demand and I shall have plenty good opportunities post PhD.\n\nFor you, I would suggest look into those roles you are interested in post-PhD and do some research if or not doing a PhD to get there is a worthy option or not. You could also choose to do a mix (like an industrial PhD). I know quite a few people employed at a company who sponsors their PhD and they get the best of both worlds. Not sure how that would work in your case but you should definitely look into it.\n\nIf geeking out/curiosity is the only reason, you can always pursue your interests without disrupting your stable career. That's what I do with photography (I pursue it without leaving my job and as a serious hobby spending a good chunk of my spare time). It would help if you have friends/support group that enables you to spend more time in your pursuit.\n\nDoing a PhD is not inherently good or bad as long as you are aware of what you are getting into and what you expect to get out of it. For me personally, dozens of people advising me against doing a PhD ever since high school never deterred me from my goal, but only made me cautious and plan well and I am glad I curated my professional path to reduce or eliminate all the risks that come with doing a PhD.\n\nAll the best :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/q67500/is_doing_phd_really_that_bad/hgco9ao/"}, "2092": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Gyroman_Anant", "Date": 1634045349, "Score": 10, "Body": "You can always send an email to the editor/publisher asking what to do in such a situation.

But from reading your replies, it doesn't necessarily sound like you want to quit-- it sounds like you need to set boundaries and take a fucking break. Treat it like a job, because it is. There is absolutely no reason you should be working 70hrs a week with zero breaks, that's absurd.

Great, you were considering leaving anyway and now your health is better for it.\n\nIt sounds to me like you dug yourself into a hole by not being able able say no and instead of drawing reasonable boundaries you're considering leaving because it's easier than telling someone \"sorry, I'm too busy to do that/I need some time off\". Do that before quitting. If you're still miserable with weekends off, then reconsider if it's worth staying. It wasn't for me, but you won't know until you try.\n\nAnd I know I sound unsympathetic, and I'm sorry for that-- I really do understand what you're going through and it's a shit position to be in.

I handed in my PhD within the 36 months but still had to stay to do the viva and by the end I was skint. In Sweden, there are better opportunities for paid extensions due much safer labor laws. Also, if something, knock on wood, should happen, like illness or as one of my friends who was hit by a car on a research stay, you would in Sweden be entitled to paid sick leave, again due to labor laws. In the UK you can take an unpaid leave of absence because you are not technically an employee. \n\nTeaching wise in the UK. The salary many unis offer for this teaching is almost laughable. You can earn more working elsewhere. Also you should consider what the next job, like a lecturer position, requires. If you go three years without teaching, like I did, many will not consider you for those positions.

After a year of searching for anything vaguely related to their PhD topic, gave up and took an admin job, working with and alongside bachelors grads at a similar pay level. That was all that was available.\n\nI think part of the reason for this is survivor bias amongst academics. Almost certainly, the reason you went into a PhD was because an academic encouraged you to do so. That academic, by definition, has survived the culling process to be where they are today. So they overestimate the chance of success and underestimate the downside of failure. This leads to the issue you're experiencing, but also systemic issues such as universities encouraging you to continue by saying things like \"don't worry, if it doesn't work out with the PhD you can always apply your statistics and measurement knowledge from your PhD / masters to another field\". In my experience, an employer is typically unable to differentiate between graduate, post graduate, as post doctoral level knowledge in these areas, nor do they really care. The best metric for success in employment is experience, not qualification.\n\nUnfortunately you, and most other PhD grads, are over qualified, and under experienced. The only way to make up for it is to take that bachelor level job, and hope that the skills you've learned will make you better at your job to rise up the ranks faster.

In the US, you are not a psychologist with just a master's (and cannot be called such). Attorneys likely would hire PhDs over you, given their higher level of qualification and thus, credibility, to evaluate an individual and testify. If evaluating individuals is not something you're interested in and you'd prefer to be a research coordinator or something like that for a forensic psych program/study, then I think a master's would be sufficient.\n\nWhile it's possible if you're in the DC area you may be able to do your PhD, internship, and a potential postdoc locally, I'd say that would be pretty uncommon and involve a bit of luck.

Attending a high-prestige program with a high-prestige advisor (in our field - psych - I can\u2019t speak to other fields) holds a lot of weight, and if you don\u2019t have these things it takes a hell of a lot more effort to stand out on the job market. At the Stanford recruitment weekend, they used this point to sell us on accepting our offers from the program: \u201cYou may have heard that getting an academic job in psychology is hard. I\u2019m willing to bet you didn\u2019t hear that from someone with a PhD from Stanford on their CV.\u201d \n\nGeneral advice is to sell yourself as an asset that can be useful to the department. They need a stats instructor? You\u2019re killer at stats and love teaching it to undergrads. They lack someone with expertise in something you know a lot about? That opens doors for them to collaborate with you, and they can list you as a team member / expert in the topic on NIH grants (NIH and NSF often make you list a specific person who you will call on for help with XYZ things in your proposals that you\u2019re not an expert in). Think of the department\u2019s weaknesses and identify ways that you can provide support in those areas. I\u2019ve seen this approach work very well. To call back to someone else\u2019s comments about supply and demand / market economies / whatever, that department is a little market and you need to make yourself as profitable to them as possible.\n\nFinally, I heard this very simple advice from professors when I was helping with a job search: If someone seems like a headache to work with, and like someone I wouldn\u2019t want to sit in committee meetings with for hours every week, that\u2019s an automatic \u201cno\u201d. In other words, don\u2019t be an asshole.\n\nAside from these things and the advice from everyone else, and surely some things none of us thought of, there is also just randomness.

There isn't. Not that a PhD is so much harder, it's just a completely different thing. Sure you might take classes at the beginning, but primarily your job is to do research. Core classes at the beginning are to get everyone on the same basic level. Beyond that classes are only for learning things that will help you specifically with some research project you are working on. You don't get problem sets or assignments from your advisor where if you complete them well enough you get your degree after you've done enough. You need to do something *new*. It's a lot of reading papers to see what's been done, thinking about gaps, and coming up with ideas to fill them. It's a lot of fun for some people (like me) who enjoy the research process but if you don't like uncertainty or not being given tasks or not being able to check your work when you're done to see if you're right it will get frustrating and stressful.\n\n*Is there a way to decrease course/workload and spread it out among a longer period of time?*\n\nAs I said above, coursework is not going to be a major component over the course of the 5-6 years you spend doing a PhD (assuming you are in the US that is a pretty standard time frame for a PhD in your field). Maybe the first year or two, but not beyond that. Yes you can spread things out, but ultimately you will be done when you have 2-3 papers+ worth of original research content. If you are worried about your mental health, it is absolutely possible to get this done working mostly 40-45 hour work weeks.\n\n*What would you recommend to focus on when planning to apply to schools?*\n\nI think I mostly answered this earlier, but research group and advisor are the main things. It's more important that you have a supportive and effective advisor than there be a perfect match in terms of research interests, and both of those are way more important than going to a \"big name\" school.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/q7elqs/thinking_about_getting_a_phd_in_the_future/hgmma1g/"}, "2575": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "arahmancs", "Date": 1634229062, "Score": 2, "Body": "It will not affect any future prospect as you will do well because you were at QMUL.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/q831ca/ive_been_accepted_for_phd/hgmmwmo/"}, "2576": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "DisastrousAnalysis5", "Date": 1634229472, "Score": 15, "Body": "Because people will steal your project and publish it themselves.

Based on the field you are, university ranking, PhD programs, lab environment, institutional support differs and these are all important aspects to consider. It\u2019s not always that ranking matters the most, cause PhD though can be about competition, it is also driven by passion about research topic and the people you work with. \n\nAs we talk about people, I\u2019ve found that relationship with your supervisor is crucial to your success and direction. My supervisor was also my lecturer when I was doing my masters and since graduation from master\u2019s I have worked with her as a TA, RA and lab researcher for about 3 years before beginning my PhD. This has allowed us to understand our working styles, what we need from each other and they also helped me build my Auxiliary supervisor team. This is so important, because I have a few friends in different labs and PhD programs, and I have heard horror stories that they don\u2019t interfere with the PhD student other than once or twice a year. So it\u2019s important to reflect on your work ethic, personality, and goals and try to find a supervisor that is accepting of those traits, shares the vision and supports you to become the best not only as a researcher, but also as a leader and a contributing academic or industry practitioner.\n\nOne important advice I was given by my supervisor is that the place where you do your PhD is also where you form a community. You attend conferences, people know your name, and it\u2019s also easier you to have meet-ups and form community based on research topics. So if you want to be an academic, it would be easier because they will know who you are as a person, a researcher and also what kind of work you\u2019ve produced. This could be difficult, not impossible if you are trying to apply for jobs in different countries, as they might have to learn about you from scratch. And when you join that institution, you will also have to build your community and relationships from ground up. My supervisor had to do that, and it\u2019s very difficult, and they advised me to try and not do that. \n\nHer advice for bypassing this was to do one semester abroad at a different university, build connections and also maybe do a 1 year post doc in a different place and 1-2 years of post doc at home, so your resume shows that you have done research in multiple locations, with different people and importantly, you have done research with people who are not your supervisor. \n\nMost of the information I\u2019ve shared is  based on intention to pursue an academic career and also comes from a field that works mostly on qualitative data and though it works with technology, it looks into the affective side of it rather than the technicalities.

Here's are the main reasons I overrule my TAs grades:\n\n1. A student argues for more points. If a student argues for more points and they actually have a decent argument, I'm willing to give them more points. This is usually when the rubric didn't cover a specific situation, and the catch all for rubrics is usually the lowest scoring item. I'm happy to stand by my TAs grades if they are right, but sometimes students do deserve more points for the work they've done. And I'd rather it be me giving out the exceptions than the TAs deciding on their exceptions. I don't generally tell TAs when I've done this because it doesn't affect their job at all. They should keep doing what their doing (and introducing looking for exceptions into the mix of their duties makes their job harder).\n\n2. I made a mistake. There are times (especially for new assignments) where my planned rubric doesn't work as I expected. Maybe most students fail to meet a certain criteria because I made a mistake in the way I wrote up the assignment. Or maybe a grading criteria doesn't adequately describe what I'm looking for. In these cases, I will go through and correct grades to what I think they should be - and I put them in my notes to update the rubric for next year. I don't tell my TAs about this because it doesn't really change what they're doing this year. Next year I'll have different TAs and they'll be given different instructions. And it doesn't seem fair of me to give my TAs extra work because I fucked up.\n\n3. My boss wants something changed. I have a supervisor (I am a PhD candidate after all), and my supervisor will regularly look over my teaching. If my supervisor sees something that needs to be changed, I will change it. And I don't tell my TAs for similar reasons to the previous category.\n\n4. I genuinely disagree about the grading.  I will do spot checks for their grading (just to make sure it's in keeping with the standard). My typical checks focus on the lowest and the highest grades (seeing if students are being graded too harshly or too leniently). Sometimes, I genuinely disagree about the grading. If this is the case, I'll usually check some of the others that a given TA graded, and if I find that I'm disagreeing on most grades, I'll schedule a meeting to go over grading standards. If I find that it was a one-off (maybe the TA graded a not great one right after a really good one, so by comparison the not great one looked worse), I'll just overrule, I won't schedule a meeting.\n\nIn most cases, I don't see the need to talk with my TAs about grading. If they ask me, and sometimes they do, I will tell them why. Which is what I think you should do, just ask if it's bothering you. You can phrase it as \"Is there something I should be doing differently?\", then you're looking for information while making it appear like you're just trying to be more helpful. But IMO, I wouldn't read too much into this.

Personally, I'm taking it easy. I got a scholarship for 5 years to get a PhD. Before I rushed through college,  spending every waking moment studying,  but now I moved town, so I want to kinda enjoy this time of my life. I have three directors,  but none of the three really cares about my research, they all have more promising candidates other than me, so I don't count on them to give me instructions anymore. My thesis is divided into 3 parts. I used to worry about doing all three at same time, but that didn't work out for me. I focused on one. Once I was almost finished with all the things I could do in that one I started to think about the next one. In order to plan my day, on the weekends I spend one hour or less planning: I think about all the things I could do during the week to advance my PhD, and then I try to sort them on days and hours (I'm bad at planning times, so I often do half of the things I plan, but here is the catch: what I don't finish this week I can do in the next one, that why it's 5 years long!). Celebrate the little victories, see how you complete small tasks that advance your PhD. To keep up with current literature,  once every two months I check what was written on the topics of my interest,  then I save all of that and read it  in a couple of weeks. The key is to save everything that seems related to your interests, and later read it fast, look for the things you're really interested in: do you wanna read about how they measured something? Pay attention to the materials and methods, do you wanna know the answer? Pay attention  to the conclusions, do you wanna know who else wrote about this topic? Pay attention to the introduction. Conferences? Courses? There aren't that many, and if there were, I wouldn't be able to afford them anyway.  Look for the ones that are close to you and try to take part, even with a humble poster, because you never know, sometimes the organizers like your topic so much they want you to talk about it. Or sometimes the audience likes your poster so much they want to hear you talking about your research, and I think that's the whole reason we research for, you know? To share it with others. 6 weeks in and your failing? 6 weeks in I hadn't even had a chat with my directors! You're gonna do great (or you're gonna leave the PhD and use your talents somewhere else, either is completely fine). Anyway,  if you'd like to vent, this community is great for that.

Neurotypical people are bad usually at considering autistic people or at even being aware of the cognitive load of camouflaging (which happens on top of an already stressful thing called a Ph.D.!) and if a Ph.D. has been dragged out like that that ain't all on you. Some of it might be, and some of it might be because of other problems you mentioned also.\n\nFor one person I know, something that they felt saved them and got them out successfully from a long Ph.D. with a difficult supervisor was this: \"Be strict with your supervisor.\" Be damned clear that you need the Ph.D. and you need it done by some particular date. Don't overload yourself with meetings with the supervisor if they are getting you down at all. Set when you meet them, maybe once every couple weeks. Do send them regular updates.\n\nAnd you force yourself to write and to write to a schedule. Set out a calendar now and put in for every fucking day what thing you are gonna write. Something every single day. Could even be a damned sentence. Trick yourself into writing if you are perfectionist. Tell yourself that you are just writing down some ideas. Then it's just a matter of tidying up what you've written down. And suddenly that's a section written.\n\nA little every single day really does add up quickly. Do that, run that fucking marathon, until the document looks like a thesis. Look at the theses from others who went ahead of you, and the theses of past students of your supervisor. Make your document look like that, make it have the same length or more. Make sure you have one or two chapters that are almost all your own work. Make sure your introduction chapter and your conclusions chapter match well. Tell a story, give it a clear ending.\n\nStims. Sorry about the walking, I hope the injury can be rectified as soon as possible. Music can be good. Sitting in nature focusing on trees can be good. Reading can be good. Depends on you.

Propanolol (your beta blockers perhaps?) can help with some symptoms like heart palpitations, and Xanax (used very sparingly!) can help too. A controversial recommendation, but tramadol also works damned well, but absolutely must be used sparingly.\n\nFor me personally, microdosing 1P-LSD (or some other legal variant, a current one being 1V-LSD, 1plsd.to) can help with increasing neuroplasticity, which can be associated with improving mood.\n\nSome thoughts.

Having studied at a different state or worked for a few years in a different city within India doesn\u2019t count. Because moving to the USA, as exciting as it may sound, the period of culture shock is inevitable. You would need time to rediscover yourself, adjust to the new environment, learn a new side of social values. This is the phase where you are going to develop beliefs, ideals and social views independently and not influenced or passed on to you by your family or the society. So take the time, for yourself. \n- finding a partner: your views and expectations about a partner and how a marriage life should be will change. You will learn to let go of the traditional gender roles in a family that were put in our heads from childhood. May be you\u2019d still prefer it that way or May be you won\u2019t. So don\u2019t rush into it. Since you mentioned that you feel you are not prepared for it yet, don\u2019t force yourself into something. After you are sure about the kind of partner you want, may be you\u2019d find the suitable person yourself or if you wish you can tell your parents about the qualities you expect. I swear they will change once you move to the US.\n- you say that you can juggle both. But the hardest part about a PhD is not juggling, it\u2019s enduring. Grad school is in no way like bachelors studies regardless of which field you are in. It requires a different kind of mental resilience. It might turn out to be highly rewarding but it is extremely mentally exhausting. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all part of the experience. Since it\u2019s the US you might also have a qualifiers exam two years down the road (I don\u2019t know about your field of study). That\u2019s an extremely stressful period. \n- no matter what people say, arranged marriage or you find a partner on your own, relationships take time to build, to get to know someone, be comfortable and get to a level closeness where you feel that they are your emotional support or to share the struggles and wins during the course of your PhD. \n\nMake a decision with all of this in your mind. An understanding  parent would value your happiness over anything.

Note that this is highly biased by my background and you will need other viewpoints.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Your primary focus is to find a program you feel confident you can complete.** This sounds insane, but keep in mind that [there is a high rate of attrition in PhD programs](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/almost-50-of-all-doctoral-students-dont-graduate/). Therefore, the name of your degree, and certainly the name of the school, should be secondary to this aim - I would advise you to seek well-run programs at reputable universities. While you should also look into what kinds of jobs are obtained by each program\u2019s graduates, keep in mind that during the course of your doctorate your opinion about what to do after you graduate is almost guaranteed to change. Importantly, this decision should override any and all of your parents\u2019 concerns. If they do not have PhDs, they have no idea what you are about to get yourself into. If you have a family friend who does have a PhD, especially in the hard sciences, I would talk to them for advice, in part to act as a counterweight to your parents on your behalf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now that we got that out of the way, how do you go about navigating the factors that determine which program to choose? Unfortunately it will involve lots of research, and you should start as early as possible. If your programs of interest are anything like the one I enrolled in, you will go through some short \u201crotations\u201d in three or four labs focusing on stuff that interests you. I would look for suitable faculty in each program **before applying** and A. contact them to see if they are taking students (they might not respond, that\u2019s fine) and B. list them in your application\u2019s cover letter with the goal of setting up an interview with them (assuming your application gets to that stage). Additionally, but no less importantly, during your interviews you will want to interact with the current crop of students at these universities. They will be with you on this journey, and you will share equipment, stories, and potentially tears with them. It goes without saying that exhausted miserable students with no lives outside of lab are a big red flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made this decision of which program to choose, there are several factors you should think about in terms of getting the most out of graduate school. Keep in mind that successful students have plenty of options in terms of whether they choose to go to industry or academia, whereas unsuccessful students essentially have the choice made for them (as I mentioned above, that you might think you know what you want to do now, but your mind may change during or after several years of graduate school). In any case, regardless of where you end up, my general advice is to focus on three tracks. First, network as much as you can by attending conferences and presenting your research, even your crappy early-stage research, just to make connections and get practice speaking. Second, publish at least one good, medium-to-high-quality paper with a convincing story you can be proud of. Based on the experience of other former PhD students I know, one good paper is all it takes for industry. While it might be nice to have more than that, my honest opinion is that a sparse publication record can be overlooked if you have other credentials, though your PI may think otherwise. Third, make an effort to learn whatever technical skills are in vogue today, which you can determine by looking through LinkedIn or Indeed. I say this as someone who did not do their due diligence and instead learned skills that, despite being academically interesting, are not used in industry at all.I know I did not answer specific questions of yours but I hope this is still helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: spacing", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qa1oe6/adviceguidance_needed_phd_in_plant_sciences/hh082z9/"}, "3186": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Sad-Ad-6147", "Date": 1634491572, "Score": 15, "Body": "&gt;The thing is, all I am feeling is disillusioned with how bad things are in the rest of the field\u2026 My committee and the anonymous reviewers talk about how incredible the thoroughness of my work is, one reviewer mentioned how the amount of work that went into it would be difficult for any one researcher to replicate. But the truth is that, while yes, I worked hard during the 4 years in which I wrote my dissertation, I also spent months at a time procrastinating, I never worked evenings or weekends, I once discovered a major mistake in one of my analyses that set me back a few months where I had to redo that entire section, and I am absolutely sure that I would have able to do it all in at least a year less if I had really pushed myself (and not made that one major mistake).

Yes, you can work while studying for a PhD, but not necessarily in every program - some programs don't allow part-time students; some assume you are not working/are only working in related positions like an assistantship and structure their program schedule accordingly, which makes working outside academia very difficult; some are fully funded, meaning all students work within the department/program while taking courses. Psychology programs don't often have part-time students, BUT they also tend to fund their doctoral students so you don't need loans.\n\n2. See the latter part of #1. Sometimes you are employed by the University (like when you have a teaching or research assistantship), some have scholarships or other funds but aren't university \"employees,\" and some are/have neither.\n\n3. Loans are an option for pretty much any accredited school/program. Interest rates are pretty low right now, but it can still feel like a ripoff. Still, it might not be that bad if you're working as well - sort of like getting the loans to you over the hump. \n\n4. Personal life greatly depends on the program, and your place in the program.

Also, only college grad in my family, I feel ya.\n\n&gt; Regarding supervisor feedback:\n\nWe have a weekly, all group meeting and he also pops into the lab to check on things often. There have been long periods where we only communicated through emails, but he's reviewing my analysis and asking questions always. I'm left to work pretty independently, but we definitely communicate often about what I'm doing and how it relates to the larger experiments (we make targets for multiple experiments).\n\n&gt; Regarding being open to new ideas:\n\nWe also have a sort of production line thing happening when an experiment is coming up. We'll make targets, test them, ship them to the national lab. It's pretty monotonous. However, when there isn't something pressing, we're trying new things, figuring out new ways to make targets. So, the production line atmosphere may just be what's required? It's hard to say without knowing more about your research. Point is, we're like that when there's deadlines coming up because the other experiments rely on our targets.\n\n&gt; Regarding corrections to writeups:\n\nThe entire reason I even care to send my work to my advisor is for technical advise. I can make with the good words and such (/s). *He's* the expert on the science. *He's* the person with decades of experience. I need him double checking my calculations and technical explanations to make sure I'm not missing something silly. He *also* messes with my figures and phrasing and such, but we all do that when we proof each other's papers (we often publish as a group anyway). So, in my experience, no, your advisor isn't checking what he needs to be checking.\n\n&gt; Regarding data manipulation and favoritism:\n\nI mean, choosing where to cut data or how to analyze it is one thing, but are they fabricating data? \"Manipulating\" data is fine as long as you're not purposely trying to misrepresent your data (like, I'll throw away data points that have too much noise, but I'm not tossing them just because I don't like the result they give me). My rule of thumb is usually get clean data and get lots of it. That way, I can afford to cut some data points out if they're too noisy or something.\n\nI'm not sure if any of this helps or what else to say, what advice to give. Environments vary so much between labs. Hit me up if you've got more questions or what clarification. For now, I've got to get some sleep.

Most people in advanced graduate study work 40-60 hours per week, often closer to 50-60 on average. This is partly out of necessity (esp. if you have other work commitments), and partly out of a desire to do the best you can - and I think it is A OK!  \n\n\nObviously, a break is needed, but I think much stress comes from people doing \"rolling\" work. I.e., working 8-10 hours a day (maybe less) but starting in the AM and finishing late at night. A few hours here, a few hours there, a few long breaks here and there and \\*bam\\* \"I've been working all day.\" Yes and no.   \n\n\nWhen people do this, it is often necessary to work weekend to catch up because it all just bleeds together. I've personally found 5-6 days a week of fairly decent length (anywhere from 8-12 hours) to work best when the time is as blocked off as possible (i.e., try to make it work along something of a normal \"shift\" - even if it has to change day to day to accommodate responsibilities). And secure one day completely off each week. \"But I can't take a day off, I'm too busy!\" Maybe so, but I'm willing to bet most people can afford to take that one day off by scheduling their time better the other days. I say this as a very busy full PhD student in course work, also working as a TA, and with a PT job and a family.   \n\n\nI think what stings about the message is the condescension and feeling the sense of the toxicity of a competitive environment like \"if I don't see you in 'x' place working, you're not doing enough\" (read: not a worthy student). That is terrible. However, I've had candid and gentle and supportive advice from supervisors and others that at many times it will simply take long days and weeks to do all I'm setting out to do. It's partly self inflicted (you don't *have* to present that extra paper), but it's also mostly the name of the game.   \n\n\nAdvanced graduate study is one of those \"occupations\" that certainly skews towards longer days and busier weeks - because of the varied demands on the student and often steep requirements from term to term. This *is* normal, we are not in labour jobs where the \"four day workweek\" booms productivity because of work-life balance, etc. We do work that needs to be done no matter what, and only by us.

Usually your funding comes either from fellowships (getting paid to do research) or teaching undergrad classes. In my program, you do fellowship for a semester, teach for most of the program, and then your final 3 semesters are fellowship again so you can focus on research. \n\nMost programs seem to discourage outside work, but many don't have strict requirements. I considered getting an additional job because my stipend was not covering all of my needs (my stipend is about 27k, but the lower pay in the summers caught me off guard) and my advisor supplemented my stipend with an extra thousand so that I wouldn't take another job and be distracted.  \n\nYou should never have to take out a student loan for a US psychology PhD program, because your tuition should always be covered. If it isn't, you might not be in a legitimate program. Some stipends may be low, so you could consider a personal loan to offset expenses (I took one out a small one in my first year so that I could take a vacation over the summer when my pay was low, but paid it back in a few months), but you should never have to pay the university anything. \n\nFinally, I'll also add that some programs have combined psychology and education programs if you're interested in that and haven't looked into them yet!

I can relate to some of what you said. The principal investigator for my PhD, the one was meant to guide and support me left the university right when I joined. Long story short, ever since I\u2019ve been desperately trying to supervise myself without clearly knowing what it is I should be doing. Imposter syndrome obviously didn\u2019t leave me alone. \n\nMeanwhile, I started falling sick from all kinds of things repeatedly. I started getting panic and anxiety attacks. The whole experience turned into a living nightmare. My health situation progressively worsened. I had diarrhoea for more than 2 years straight! All the range of physical and mental health challenges I faced made me feel like I must be dying soon. But I didn\u2019t.\n\nLike you, I\u2019ve developed a pattern of constant negative thoughts and it\u2019s almost like my brain is always hunting for what it can reassess and paint as a failure, potential risk, negative thing etc. My brain started to pull up memories from my entire life! Listing everything I\u2019ve ever done wrong or didn\u2019t do well enough and how they might come back to ruin my life. The panic and anxiety attacks out of these loops were intense. On top of dealing with all that, these attacks make it such that I start losing sensations in my limbs. So a random thought (such as your CV details example) would come to my mind and instantly I could feel an electronic change in my body. My limbs would start going numb and my heart rate changed and I started feeling like something terrible is waiting for me. \n\nDespite all that, I managed to come up with a plan for my research work and give it my best and produced a thesis. It took more than everything to do that. I also have my defence/viva in about two weeks time. The only thing that\u2019s keeping me going now is that I\u2019ve done all I could and I will just have to accept the outcomes. \n\nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever reliably ends those negative loops for me. Acceptance. Things aren\u2019t perfect and of course could have been different. Maybe I will fail or maybe not. All I can do now is to not give up and just fight until the end. I fear that if you allow your brain to work you up like that, it will go in the direction it went for me. Soon it will be listing all possible points of failure and all possible things that could reflect negatively on you or your future. Trust me you don\u2019t want to live like that. I needed my wife to hug me tight and keep her hand on my chest at nights just to reduce the nightmares or calm me down when I started panicking in the middle of my sleep. \n\nFocus on the things you can do right and do them and learn from the things that didn\u2019t go well to avoid such mistakes going forward. Keep pushing forward and accept whatever is the outcome in the long run. Whether someone is or isn\u2019t a PhD material cannot he determined by how many months they spent in a lab.

The best way is usually to position that experience as something that will benefit them. If you have research experience, even if it's from a different field, it should still be something that can benefit them. \n\nThe SOP usually doesn't include details about research ideas, there is no room enough for that. You are expected to include research interests, but not explain them in depth. If the program wants to know your research ideas, it will probably ask for that using some other method (e.g., ask for a research or during an interview). \n\nHow far you can deviate usually depends on your advisor and your program. If your advisor has quite broad interests, or the program is quite diversified in terms of faculty interests, then you should have more room to change. A lot of PhD students don't actually research what they intended to do when they applied.

(We all should admit that we\u2019re nicer to people that seem attractive, though we preach and try practicing equality-I know several who\u2019s received extra \u201chelps\u201d in their grants etc because they were being flirty..now I sound so jaded huh lol)\n\nAnyways, awards, grants, and publications are some of the tangibles measures, and because it is your peers that evaluate your work, not machines, bias is often introduced. With everything being so competitive, if you were in contention for winning something, the edge is minimal. It sometimes depends on the mood of the reviewer that day. Hence I believe likeability of the person is the most important trait, that\u2019ll push the researcher through that barrier.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qdabt8/most_important_trait_of_a_researcher/hhmw6fx/"}, "4033": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TulliusC", "Date": 1634919879, "Score": 3, "Body": "This answer also applies to the entirety of life. \n\nI agree with you totally.

On the one hand, you have the majority of researchers, who are mediocre at best. They publish in terrible venues like local conferences, non-indexed journals, etc. Some are a little bit better, but still publish in like Q3 Q4 journals. You can hardly find any novel, innovative publication from venues like those and from people like them. The sad fact is that they are the majority, even holding important positions in underdeveloped countries like mine. I know many professors in my country, who have never published even a Q2 journal. For reference, me, a 3rd year PhD student in the same field as the mentioned professor, have 6 Q1 papers in 2 years. And I'm not even the best in my team, nor did I fully dedicate my time for research.\n\nOn the other hand, you have brilliant researchers who constantly publish in absolute top venues. Most of their papers are novel and have significant impacts. See the paper \"Deep Learning\" by Yoshua Bengio for example. That paper, I believe, have impacts that extend much further beyond  the  research community. I think at least 50% of the current AI applications in the whole world are based on that paper.  Of course it's kinda impossible to reach that level, but you can always aim for a little bit lower. For example, my supervisor and one teammate (a 4th year PhD student) have several patents from the ideas of their papers. They are in no way on Bengio level, but they can still create significant contributions and novel ideas that can be applied in practice.\n\nMoreover, I believe that research is not a one-man job. Every (good) paper contributes to something bigger in general. For example, the paper from Bengio I mentioned is the foundation, based on which many papers build upon to enable the application of deep learning in many fields. You will need one paper to apply that for image processing, one for natural language processing, etc. And then, different type of image processing processes, in different scenarios, need further research.  Therefore, there are still much room for novel ideas and contributions.\n\nSo, imo, if you want to make significant contributions with innovative ideas, it's totally possible.  You just need to find and learn from good researchers, although they are much fewer in numbers compared to the mediocre ones.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qdl1dx/academia_and_publishing_for_publishings_sake/hhpw6l7/"}, "4136": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Spot-Odd", "Date": 1634973854, "Score": 1, "Body": "Unless the program or funding specifically has an age limit or equivalent for whatever reason (e.g. Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD fellowship), you're never too old.

Ask the supervisor who gives that topic. In that way, you can get a feeling of what actually is research, and also it helps boost your CV if you wanna do a PhD.\n\nRegarding motivation, I don't really know. Imo, you should only do a PhD if you like research. But it's kinda hard to know without actually doing the thing itself, hence the suggestion I gave earlier. I mean it's of course possible to do a PhD without any passion, but then does it worth all the stress and difficulties? Wanting to learn more is fine, like to teach is fine. But they are not the core of a PhD. You can always learn more with a second Master, or like in my country, you can teach in uni with just a Master degree if you teach Economics. The core of a PhD is research. Do you want to research for the rest of your life?\n\nBackground is never a serious problem for a good PhD student. Of course it slows things down a bit if you don't have enough background, but eventually you will stumble upon new things without any background. Then, you will need to learn. So don't worry much about this. Also, PhD topics are often very narrow. High chance that you won't have background for most of them. If you only apply for topics that you have background on, your chance to get a PhD position might be much lower.\n\nBeing good enough for PhD is another interesting question. Honestly, I believe you will need somewhat ok-ish intelligence. Then, you also need ok-ish English. You will have to work hard, you will have to learn by yourself. Skills and other things can be learned gradually, if you have sufficient intellectual capability and discipline.\n\nSo TL,DR: Since I don't have much info about you, I suggest to find a Master thesis topic that can be further developed to be a paper.

The issue is, with a STEM PhD, you learn as you go along. So by the time you have an expert level understanding of the topic, there are certain changes to your experimental setup that would have been better for your investigation. But by that point, it's kind of too late because you've already ran the experiments in a certain way. \nSo, if I were given a chance to redo the PhD with the same topic, I'll be able to produce a far better dissertation with better publications, in a shorter time.

So dont stress yourself out after 9 months into the PhD because youre getting stuck. Everyone gets stuck. Everyone loses focus from time to time. Even professors. Trust the education process. Just lower your demand and expectation for your preliminary work, and get started and work on it knowing that youll go through the same work again later, again and again - and take breaks when you need it. Ask your supervisor for guidance! Its a marathon, not a sprint. And youre not alone - neither in the situation (we are many PhDs going through the same pressure, stress, frustration and emotions as yourself), nor in your work (cus you have a supervisor). \n\nOnce you realize that a PhD isnt easy for anyone, and that doing a PhD is a marathon requiring patience, stamina and a lot of trial and error, you will learn to manage pressure and stress. Under pressure, diamonds are made. But it takes time. Trust the education process. And have faith in yourself. You are where you are for a reason. You are good enough. Or else, you wouldnt have landed the PhD position to begin with.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOh, and a small joke in the end here: Research is called research for a reason. You search and then you re-search! \n\nAnd in the name of science: \u00abThe word research is derived from the Middle French \"recherche\", which means \"to go about seeking\", the term itself being derived from the Old French term \"recerchier\" a compound word from \"re-\" + \"cerchier\", or \"sercher\", meaning 'search'.

And this is the whole point of my post.  You must be an exceptional student and most PhD students are not as good as you.  Or you must really have your shit together or be excellent at time management.\n\nI realized that unless I was an elite scholar (as you seem to be), that *at that point in my life I realized that I needed a change because I was headed for a mental breakdown.*\n\nI was pretty lost at that point and by the end was trying to find a new academic direction.  Academia pays poorly in my country and I wanted a family and didn't want to be dragging them all over the world unless it was worth it, i.e., unless I was making a valuable contribution to society and still had time for a family.  It just seemed like a lonely, frustrating, and egotistical lifestyle.\n\nI did a LOT of reading by academics *about* academica (e.g., R.W. Hamming has a fantastic essay on this), and also looked around at what others had written, told me, and what I had seen with my own eyes.  And *everywhere* it was the same story... that the higher up you get the more hours you work and the more time you spend in meetings instead of doing research (much like many other jobs).  I researched the lives and autobiographies of many highly regarded mathematicians (a field related to my own) and everywhere I was readingthe same confessions: long hours and marriage breakdowns.  Early on when I read some of these things I was young and felt invincible, like I could clear these hurdles without hurting myself.\n\nAfter my fianc\u00e9e and I broke up I was *completely* useless as a postdoc so I quit my job, moved to another country for a working holiday, and started networking.  I was exhausted from the continual grind of the paper mill...\n\nAnd so I was very lucky to get a great job in another country doing exactly what I was doing in my postdoc.  It was a very special job, a once in a lifetime kind of thing.  Suddenly I was surrounded by more sociable and much more supportive people, and meeting people at my workplace who I was learning more from than when I was in academia.  (This also happened at the first internship I did during my undergraduate years.)  There were many people who had from universities such as MIT, Harvard, Brown, BU, Columbia, NYU, and Yale, and many other \"household name\" universities (the job was in Boston so naturally there was a higher concentration of people from the North East United States).  I'm not a snob when it comes to universities and their rankings, however this was the first time I spent significant time with so many people from so many famous universities, and I really, really enjoyed the academic atmosphere around New England.  The streets were beautiful, and I was lucky to first arrive during fall.  I believe that a productive and supportive environment is the biggest predictor of academic success once you become a postdoc.\n\nHowever I was struck by the similarities in our experiences as postdocs (there were about five other PhD's in this company of 50 people people or thereabouts).  And when we went out socializing or networking I met many, many other PhD students and postdocs.  And *everybody* was working their asses off just to keep their heads above water.\n\nSo I'm not saying don't do a PhD.  In fact I'm VERY glad that I stuck it out and completed my PhD because it opened up a whole new life for me.  But it was very, very difficult because I didn't have the support I needed, and this could have reduced a 50 hours research project into a 20 minutes explanation from somebody who already knows the black arts of your shared field.\n\nI think it all boils down to the egotistical, selfish, and competitive nature of many academics.  I had SO MANY ideas pooh-poohed during meetings with my supervisor and then I'd hear him discussing them with other professors at conferences in his select \"in-group\"; a few months later they'd be publishing work based on the ideas I had told my supervisor about.  He was very calculating about how something could further **his** career.  And this is a VERY common trope in academia.  I was already fed up with people like that, and I was only just beginning.\n\nThe dreaded paper mill seemed ridiculous to me, and I feel immense guilt every time I submitted a new paper with minor tweaks on previous papers just to get another publication in.\n\nCongratulations on your brilliant academic career.  I wish I could have been as successful as you are.

Usually you'd be a co-author if you were judged as having contributed enough intellectual input to the paper. In all cases, you must be supervised by a competent academic on how to do good enough research for publications.\n\n\nP. S. I saw that you posted a question about the perfect PhD application. The answers there are too literal and really push for true perfection. Fortunately, no school considers publications as any form of prerequisite for an applicant. It's definitely a big plus, but it definitely won't be held against you if you don't have it. Graduate school admissions want to see good grades, good experience, good insight, and good references. If you have those then you could for sure apply for programs.

The range of what you can actually pursue/explore seems to narrow by the day...\n\nYou may know the answer to this already, but it's the building of a false narrative.\n\nNovel ideas are among the highest intellectual currency. If you have a cool new idea that works, that transforms fields, that alters how we view the universe, then your value skyrockets. Your value as a researcher explodes. You're a genius among geniuses.\n\nBut novel ideas are a *threat* to establishment. And control doesn't come fromthe funding agencies or journals, but the reviewers. The researchers at the top whose careers are in direct conflict with your own.\n\nSo academia pushes an *ideal*, an ivory tower utopia, in which they say is upheld by the greatest of ideas. And yet, the powers that be are encouraged more through power to hold things as they are, to promote *their* work and ideas. It's a false narrative, often used to retain control. It's the tainting of an ideal, and hard to not be skeptical once identifying a naivete.

I don't think so. Is it exclusive to academia? Of course not. But I think it's a mix of situations (e.g. shitty pay, intense politics, lack of promotional ability, stress, lack of real gains, a profession lead by passion in many cases) that make academia less and less attractive. I would argue that most students are not taught nowadays *to* really think, to be clever in coming up with ideas. And if they do, they're not staying in academia.\n\nWhere it takes people from there is difficult. Do you fix the system from within? Do you leave for something else?

Bias against 1st generation academics\n\n14. Most of research is completely bogus because famous people get grants, can't do the research then try to satisfy baseline requirements with meaningless academic prose\n\n15. Abusive employment contracts for PhD and Postdocs that end up doing the majority of the work\n\n16. Its basically a pyramid/ponzi scheme that predates on the dreams and ambitions of mainly young people\n\n17. Inability of academics to deal with critique\n\n18. Rampant and far reaching abuse of power/authority\n\n19. Obnoxious focus on gender and race to avoid difficult questions and pretend to support social causes\n\n20. Lack of actual scientific rigour, a lot of pretending to be scientific (even in medicine shockingly) when things do not work out\n\n21. Profs suffering from Dunning-Kruger when talking about subjects outside their field\n\n22. No respect or value for lower ranking employees\n\n23. Toxic competitive environment that encourages sabotage, authorship disputes or intellectual theft between peers\n\n24. Spend more time writing grants, networking and begging than research as junior academic\n\n25. Routine unpaid overtime and midnight phone calls\n\n26. Covert threats from PI to force you to do their work\n\n27. Constant ethics violations that are status quo even in ivy league\n\n28. Supervisors or PI making empty promises or even going as far to forge documents (witnessed this once myself) and annul contracts\n\n29. Misappropriation of research funding for personal expenses of PI\n\n30. Lab PIs taking credit for their PhDs work and adding on irrelevant authors \n\n31. Virtually no significant meritocracy in most grants, awards and appointments\n\n32. Entire career track boils down to a huge luck factor going from postdoc to assistant prof after you put in many years of work and effort, never any certainty\n\n33. University ethics board and support systems that only exist to protect the university against lawsuits and whistleblowers\n\n34. As postdoc you can never settle down and basically cannot have a social life to be entered into tenure lottery, have seen good people with 8+ years postdoc still hoping because otherwise they start from 0 in industry (sunk costs)\n\n35. Ridiculous costs of open access with reviews in short time frame, otherwise spend upwards 6 months waiting for reviews - gives huge competitive advantage to grant hoarders and wealthy faculties\n\n36. The expectation of doing unpaid labour on top of your full time job\n\n37. More and more focus on being famous, being a 'rockstar', putting in good PR for your faculty rather than just being a honest, focussed researcher\n\n38.

Like I said, often the name of the school is just a threshold thing - having other exciting things on your resume will make you stand out, and probably even moreso than having a top-tier school name on your resume would.\n\nFor example, I turned down a top-tier school for undergrad because at the second-tier school I went to, I received a research scholarship that I knew would more than make up for the name of the school on my resume, regardless of who was looking at it. Do these \"lesser\" schools offer internships? Will going there make it easier to work directly with profs on interesting research? These things can make the fact that you went to a lower-tier school less meaningful, because they represent tangible measures of your ability that don't rely on wealth, for example.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qg3uh5/phd_folks_do_you_think_that_the_name_of_the/hi3y3ov/"}, "4774": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Cool__Cookie", "Date": 1635253470, "Score": 2, "Body": "I think that you can ask the editor for a referee change, I'm kinda surprised that after 9 months they didn't replace him automatically.

In my case, the Canadian government offer some funding for Canadian PhD students abroad, although it's very competitive.\n\nHowever,  regardless of your student status, you should be applying to funded PhD projects considering you are in STEM. Even if the funding is different for international students (like lower stipend due to higher tuition fees, which is common in the UK) there should still be funding for home students that do not require them to bet on getting a competitive scholarship. If a PhD research project can't get funding at all, it's not a good sign as it often means the subject is not relevant enough or is not expected to contribute much to science. Otherwise, it would generate interest and get funded. So I understand that you are interested in the research project they offered you, but I recommend you take a step back and ask yourself why nobody can offer to fund it and expect you to fund yourself through scholarships.  The only exception is PhD research projects funded through UKRI as this is equivalent to a grant given by a funding body. If you look into other research projects, I recommend that you consider those eligible for UKRI funding (international students can now receive these grants due to Brexit).\n\nThat being said, as you must be aware, it is not common outside the US to go directly from undergrad to PhD unless you are an exceptional student. Considering that you deem yourself an average student and that your supervisor does not think you could get a competitive international scholarship, then I do not think you are likely to be accepted in another PhD program outside the US if it does not involve your current supervisor or school. So, with that in mind, if you want to pursue a PhD, here are your realistic options in my opinion:\n\n1. Do a master and try to apply to funded PhD programs afterwards as you would be much more competitive. Research master can get funding. If you want to do a taught master, look into doing some part-time TA or RA work to help fund yourself.\n2. Do a fully-funded PhD in the US where you don't need to have a master. Many US universities also offer studentships where you have to do TA or RA work in exchange for a tuition waiver and stipend. I recommend that you apply to these kinds of PhD programs as everyone is usually more likely to be accepted in those compared to programs offering ''free'' tuition waiver and stipend.\n3. You will lose nothing by applying for the scholarship your school suggested. Worse that can happen is that you don't get it and need to consider other options.  However,  I think any external or government scholarship should be seen as a great way to compensate for the lower funding international students usually get for PhDs in the UK due to the higher tuition fees rather than a way of justifying doing a PhD research project that was not able to secure any grants or funding. So if you find a funded PhD research project, I recommend that you apply to these scholarships in addition to whatever you receive from the university/funding body grant. \n\nSimilar to my suggestion for the master, you could technically work part-time and do a part-time PhD to fund yourself. However, considering what I mentioned above, the issue with a self-funded PhD is not only that it creates money problems for you, it's also about what it indicates for the relevance of the research. So I don't recommend you to go down that route and encourage you to consider the other options instead. Also in the UK, as international students, we are often seen as cash cows, so be careful about anyone related to an institution trying to talk you into doing a self-funded project.

This was great because it means he can stay home as a full-time parent while I work and go to school. If you're not able to do that, how do you bring your cost of living down? If you're going to wait a year or two, how can you maximize your salary in order to achieve your goals? \n\n\\- Talk to your partner about the hard stuff - what are their expectations, how much work do they think a PhD is going to be? I go to work at 8 am, come home around 5:30, spend time with my kid for 2-3 hours before I put him to bed, hang out with my partner for about an hour and then try to get two-ish hours of reading in before I go to bed. I do this 6 days a week. I spend one full day with my kid. I sometimes work from home, but try to stick to this schedule. \n\n\\- Check out what resources are available at your potential school for breastfeeding/pumping spaces. Figure out if this is important to you. I continued to breastfeed my son, so that meant I needed to bring all of my pumping gear with me to campus. I didn't have access to a cool place to store milk, so I needed to also bring a cooler. Breastfeeding spaces suck at my school, this meant I pumped in bathroom stalls or faculty offices. I had to talk to my faculty about how I might need a longer break to pump depending on the timing in three and a half-hour classes. I bought one of those rolling suitcase mobile offices and lugged it on busses and across two campuses. This was important to me but it was also really hard. \n\n\\- My first and second year I spent a lot of time working at night so I could spend more time with my baby. this was worth it to me, but not everyone can work at night. I also co-slept with my baby so I would feel closer to him and keep up my milk. \n\n\\- When do you want to start? I would recommend having a newborn before starting classes. Those first three months are a blur, and it was nice to have maternity leave. Conversely, you could start, have a baby and take a semester off to heal and be with your baby in the first six months. I know this is complicated with funding etc...but in the long run does it really matter if you need an extra semester? \n\nI would encourage you to remember that a PhD is basically just a job, you can do it, you're awesome. Being a mom has helped me cut through the BS and just hyperfocus on what I'm trying to do. I think the advice to wait until after you graduate is sexist. Many male graduate students are encouraged to have babies in their program because there aren't the same expectations about caring for an infant. I also think we should all (graduate students) take a hard look at academic culture. If we're the future how do we want to actively disrupt it to make it a better and more equitable workplace? TAKE YOUR MATERNITY LEAVE, spend time with your family, be a person who has space for leisure and self-care. **This is just a job.** \n\nI know you might roll your eyes at this and think, this chick does not have a clue. I have worked in higher ed for 11 years. I'm pretty familiar with what it takes to be successful in US higher ed. I cannot tell you how often I have heard older female faculty and administrators talk about their regrets because they weren't able to have children. I understand that there is entrenched sexism within our system and our current mentors had a different experience, but that doesn't mean you have to repeat it. Live your life, do the things that make you happy, work towards your goals. Being a mom is so fucking hard, but man, do I love my kid, and does he bring me so much freaking joy in this truly awful time in our history. \n\nSorry for the long post. :) good luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qg8rqo/did_you_have_kids_while_doing_your_phd/hi5kcmu/"}, "4849": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "shyskeletor", "Date": 1635277710, "Score": 1, "Body": "thank you!

I was pretty much in your exact same situation. I\u2019m an Italian-Canadian student and I have done both BSc and MSc here in the UK, and I\u2019m now doing a PhD in civil and geotechnical engineering and working om my own project. I also was an average student (2:1 - 3.3 GPA) and I didn\u2019t manage to get the only scholarship I applied for cause my decision of starting a PhD was quite last minute. Sad times. The difference is that I did not want to wait a year cause I felt like I was wasting time. The fact that I\u2019m half Italian enabled me to access doctoral loans, and then I thought \u201cokay, I\u2019ll apply for a loan first year and in the meantime I\u2019ll also look for sponsors to support my research. Well that was a massive flop- I received close to 0 responses, and the few ones I received basically were \u201cnot interested\u201d. They don\u2019t want to fund stuff that has already started, they\u2019ll just wait for your work to go public at the end of your PhD so that they can use it for free basically.\nNow between doctoral loan and student loan I have got about \u00a357k ($78k or CA$97k) in debt (luckily student loans should not hurt your credit). \n\nI don\u2019t know your sector, but my advise for you is: 1) try getting in touch with companies, send out a TON of funding requests (like tens and tens); 2) try getting in touch with people on LinkedIn - I got some responses from there too; 3) DTPs (but I guess you know that already; 4) Societies - I won a fieldwork grant from Geological Society of London that is worth nearly \u00a33k; 5) government sometimes has funding opportunities for overseas students.\n\nI hope this helps\n\n Whereabouts are you based if I may ask?\n\nP.s. if you\u2019re really passionate about what you\u2019re doing, consider getting a student loan.

It's very possible but it requires unique sacrifices and brings challenges. \n\nVery surface level Pros: \n\n1. You are forced to have work/life balance. So many PhD students live, eat, breathe their research- which can be great- but being forced to step away, do simple and repetitive things, gain perspective day after day is really nice too! \n2. I like that my daughter sees me studying and working hard. She \"helps\" me and as a result, loves going to school herself. It's not a chore- its something she sees I love- so she is liking it too. I hope it sets her up for a lifetime of loving learning. \n3. Parenting is a challenge and is often isolating from other adults. Not when you're a PhD student! You get a great balance with other students. \n\nCons:\n\n1. Lots of late nights and early mornings. It's challenging to plan anything so about 80% of my research, reading and writing is done between 8pm-6am. It's hard but you get used to it.\n2. Professors/other students don't always understand your priorities. For example, I was asked to help out with something this Sunday evening. Well... it's Halloween and I'm going trick-or-treating with my daughter. Its just me and her, so if I can't go- neither can she and I'm not doing that to her, so I said no. I got a snarky reply back about my commitment level. Likewise, I miss a lot of the student gatherings and off-campus optional activities because I simply can't spend more time away. \n3. Your time is so limited, you have to pick and choose what you do- you can't do it all and that does bite you sometimes and make you feel burned out. Every spare second is working so forget a good social life, sleeping adequately, or taking a few days off. Every second has to count. \n\nThe best advice I was given when I started was to know which balls are glass and which are plastic. We're all juggling many balls, but some are plastic and be let go and bounce. Others are glass and absolutely cannot be dropped. They're constantly changing but as long as you know which are which, you're fine. The Sunday request- that's a plastic ball whereas spending a holiday with my daughter is very much a glass ball. The literature review due Nov. 15 is a glass ball but watching Frozen II for the 10,000th time is a plastic ball. \n\nIt's very possible. Parenting is difficult. PhDs are difficult.

I personally don't have kids yet, but know several people that did. Some things you might want to consider:\n\n1. A PhD is essentially a full time job. You can treat it as 9-5 work M-F if that works for you. It's harder to do so the first 2 years when you're taking classes + research + TA'ing, but later on it gets easier to set those boundaries. All the parents I knew in the program really take advantage of that set work day structure and spend the other hours in the day with their family.\n\n2. Consider what your finances will be. You should get a stipend during your PhD (don't do an unfunded program), but it's not much money to support a kid with. Some programs also won't let you hold other work positions.\n\n3. If you don't want to sacrifice your career for kids but definitely want them, it's probably more ideal to have them during the PhD than after. If we say it takes 1 postdoc before getting a TT faculty job, that's 9-10 years post-PhD before having tenure (assuming 2-3 postdoc and 7 to get tenure at an R1). That's a long time to wait. \n\nThat said I think if it's what you really want, you can find a way to make it work at any stage.

That said, it might give you some ideas.\n\nFirst, a language can be loosely split into four parts: reading, listening, writing and speaking. Improving one won\u2019t translate 1:1 to the others, so it\u2019s useful to consider what you want/need out of each. For example, I\u2019m an avid reader and listener, as well as an aspiring writer who prefers writing in English (larger audience). As such, I\u2019m near-fluent in those three areas. Speaking, however, has only ever been moderately important to me. As such, I still have an accent and regularly mispronounce words.\n\nSecond, if there\u2019s a native or otherwise fluent speaker you know, talk to them! Conversation is the best way to really learn a language. Speaking English with people with different native languages also helps, since you\u2019ll learn to understand different accents. There\u2019s also a variety of apps available to help you learn, which tend to require only 15 minutes or so per day. Duolingo and Memrise are two I\u2019ve personally used. I liked Memrise better as, in my experience, it spends more time on the grammar. I\u2019d recommend at least trying one out if there\u2019s a native language option available for you, since these apps cover all four parts and are designed to teach you.\n\nBack to the four parts:\n- Reading is probably easiest to improve: just read! Early on you\u2019ll probably want to read moderately difficult texts, where you need to look up a few words but not too many. You want to learn, but it shouldn\u2019t become a translation exercise, since you\u2019ll probably forget half the words you learnt afterwards. It\u2019ll also help in giving you a feeling for the grammar and will form the basis for the other skills. When you\u2019re nearing fluency, even badly written texts can help (they made me really sensitive to mistakes).\n- For listening, I\u2019ve mostly used films, tv programs and music. Always use English audio for the former two (I suppose that\u2019s logical). Preferably watch with no subtitles (bonus for listening) or English subtitles (bonus for the link between text and pronunciation). If that doesn\u2019t work for you, watching with subtitles in your native language still will help you get used to how the language is supposed to sound. When it comes to music, looking up the lyrics of songs you like can really help. You can read along (just like with English subtitles) and learn how the text is pronounced, while also learning the lyrics and meaning of a song you like.\n- As for writing, reading will help but isn\u2019t everything. You\u2019ll probably need to learn some extra grammar, and then write. If you can, get your writing checked by someone. Spellcheckers can help as well but beware: they\u2019re not quite smart enough yet to always correct to the right word. If unsure, it\u2019s best to manually check if the correction also yields the correct translation (I say this after years of having to read \u2018defiantly\u2019 where the writer means \u2018definitely\u2019).\n- Finally, speaking is, again, best improved through practice. Unless it\u2019s your aim, your English speech does not have to be perfect (if it is, you\u2019ll need a fluent speaker at the least, and preferably an actual teacher). Instead, focus on getting the gist of it right. You\u2019ll want to be able to confidently form sentences (this is really the most important part). You\u2019ll also need approximately correct pronunciation, approximately correct grammar, and a nicely sized vocabulary. The apps mentioned above as well as any other place where the word is pronounced (like online dictionaries) are good sources for learning pronunciation: listen and repeat.\n\nSome final notes:\n\nIf I judge your English skills from this post, you seem to be good enough to make yourself understood in English, and you usually pick the right words to use. You do make mistakes in the grammar. I think you\u2019re applying some grammar rules from your native language to your English: your native language feels natural, so English written with the grammar of your native language looks good. I see this a lot, and most of my mistakes when writing also stem from this.

Should I be judged by my lack of research paper at this stage? What happens if 2 non-1st auth manuscripts that are being re-submitted/ 1 1st auth paper being prepped all get accepted in the next quarter? Am I ahead then?

Having experience at a national lab helps a lot IMO. All my interviewers were very interested in this part of my resume. As you said, anything below 100k is because you are being lowballed\n\nAt national labs, the salaries depend on your title. Usually you do 1-2 years of postdoc (~$80k) and then become a scientist ($100-130k). 130k is for NNSA labs (Sandia, LLNL, LANL) and 100k for the others. You should get a 30-40k raise every 4-5 years. This is not great, because tech companies pay way more and the benefits are similar or better. Entry level reserarch positions with a PhD in tech companies (Google Research, FB research, maybe Microsoft Research, etc) may be anywhere in the 200-400k range, but in general you need to be a pretty strong candidate to get a position there. Another option you may want to consider with your background is working for a hedge fund/proprietary trading firm as a Quant Researcher (entry level is 300-400k), specially if you want to live in Boston (e.g. Akuna Capital). If you want a data scientist position or a research engineer position, there are many options available and you may be looking into a 150k offer, maybe a bit more with stock options. Salary progression is also important. It's hard to make more than 200-250k at national labs even for very senior staff, whereas in tech companies sky is the limit. It is not unlikely to see 1M-2M packages for people with 10-20 years of experience\n\nStarting 1.5 years in advance is good advice.

You sought higher education, but it seems you did that without really understanding what that meant, and what that would lead you to. \n\nI always repeat here something that a professor told me. That research is a very unusual type of job where failure is the standard. We fail to understand, we fail to reach valid conclusions, we fail to explain our conclusions, we fail to publish papers, etc. Success is rare. Uncertainty is high. You can image how many failures researchers have faced over time while trying to find a cure for cancer, for example. Researchers who are probably extremely competent, and still fail. And still persist despite all that. \n\nSo, part of the struggle is expected. Existing knowledge is structured, but researching new knowledge is often an adventure, in uncharted, risky, uncertain, dangerous territory. Oftentimes, no one really knows the way to go (if they knew, they probably would have researched and published already). \n\nHowever, there are some differences. For example, I also don't like the very abstract stuff. I understand that I need to deal with that a little, but I don't want to focus on that.

That's something I usually recommend people to check. \n\nAlmost everyone question whether it's worth it.

While I think this is a super rare case, I will still share, and try to give some ideas for general applicability.\n\nWas miserable despite a really good setup. Just ultimately felt like a bad fit for a lot of reasons, and no one individual was at fault. I was lucky enough to pick up a job offer after I wrapped up coursework, and I was open and honest about wanting to give that a try because I didn't feel as engaged and happy in the PhD as I expected. Had good grades, and great relationships in the program -- everyone said it was a total shock to them, but I felt like it should have been wildly obvious to everyone that I was unhappy.\n\nAnyhow. I left, and spent 4 years in the nonprofit / higher ed admin world, and was successful. Finally could have a normal life -- work is done at 5pm, I have the mental / emotional energy to date and make friends outside of school, etc. It was nice. I got married, and things were wonderful. I also hit a glass ceiling at work and got bored intellectually. I talked to my wife about going back and she was super encouraging. We decided the best case scenario was to pick up where I left off (to shave a few years off the process) but if all else failed I could straight up start over somewhere else. Not ideal but it was an option. \n\nSo I wrote the dept. I originally left and wouldn't you know it, everyone there remembered me and was excited about welcoming me back (technically, I wrote my advisors, who were happy to welcome me back, but the whole decision went to the graduate committee who had to agree to let me back in, in place of a new student, in terms of funding distribution. So THEY were who let me back in).\n\nAnd here we are -- that was 3 years back. I'm on track to finish in May 22, and the department has asked me to stick around for a 'gap year' where I'll teach as the instructor of record (not common at my school). I'm considering it, but also just straight up looking at other jobs.\n\nSo, what are the takeaways:\n\n* Leave on good terms, no matter what, if you can. Obviously not possible for everyone but if it is, then being open, honest, and genuine throughout the process is super valuable.\n* Don't feel like you're stuck one way or another. If I can return to a program I quit, and be welcomed back and be on track to finish in &lt;1 year, then anyone can. I am far from special.\n* The 'real world' is hella nice. But depending on what you want to do with your career, a PhD may be vital to avoid hitting the glass ceiling. So have your eyes wide open about that.

BUT, this is perhaps too general, and there are some things to consider first. Now, the funding situation is *not* the only thing that you want to consider about this opportunity. You also want to consider who it is that you'll be working with, and how much flexibility you may have to change supervisors in the department. Here are some questions/things to consider:\n\n1. What is your discipline? If you are pursuing a PhD in STEM, then you absolutely should be getting paid to do your PhD in the US. As for PhDs in the humanities, I'm not so certain. All of my friends pursuing PhDs in humanities are getting paid to do so, but often-times much less than I and my STEM PhD friends. It is still enough to pay for tuition and rent though (I'm at a Canadian institution, so tuition is *much* less, and it is more normal for it to not be covered by the advisor up front)\n2.  Did you indicate on your application that you would be able to self-fund, or that you were bringing your own funding? Sometimes, PhD students will be taken on more readily if they are bringing their own funding with them. Oftentimes, this \"self-funded\" situation means though that you have a scholarship or some other research grant that is not tied to a specific supervisor or university.\n3. Did your potential supervisor indicate to you that they would not have the funding to support you were you to accept the offer from the university? Or did you find out about their lack of funding for you *only* after you asked them about a GRA/GTA?\n   1. I find it a little suss that a supervisor took you on as a PhD student despite not having positions available in their lab at the time. If this person did not indicate to you (without you needing to ask them first) that they lacked the funding to support you, then I would say run (from them at least). This is to me a major red flag. You want to find a supervisor that will advocate for you - someone who is on your side and has your best interests at heart. A PhD is a long and arduous thing to undertake. It's worse with a shitty supervisor.\n4. Have you spoken with anyone from the department that *isn't* your potential supervisor? It sounds like you really need to contact the graduate student advisor in your department (there absolutely should be one). \n   1. I would email this graduate student advisor and ask *them* about GTA positions. They would know better than your potential supervisor. They should also have more information on other funding opportunities through the university. \n   2. You should also ask them if there are other people in the department looking for PhD students.  Your acceptance should not be tied with this potential supervisor that lacks funding. You are well within your rights to swap supervisors before even starting! Sometimes, there are other people in the department that *do* have funding, but none of the incoming students expressed interest in working with them... I've had a few friends swap supervisors for funding reasons alone. It happens. \n   3. If the graduate student advisor doesn't seem willing to chat with you or attempt to help, then this is also a major red flag. Also, if they try to tell you that you *need* to work with the potential supervisor without funding, run. I turned down a PhD opportunity in the US for an MSc opportunity in Canada because the grad advisor was insistent that I work with a supervisor that I had just found out was emotionally abusive to his students... simply because I had indicated initial interest, and no other incoming student had. That type of shit should not be tolerated, no matter what. \n5. If the graduate student advisor in your department sucks, the last thing that you could do is contact administration in the school of graduate studies (should represent *all* grad students in all departments at the university). They are also good resources for funding opportunities, and may advocate for you if others won't. Especially if you're coming from a third-world country, the university may even have specific funding initiatives for students like you (with less competition)! You never know until you ask!\n6. Does your country of origin have any funding opportunities that incentivise post-graduate work abroad? I'm guessing that as a third-world country, likely not... but, again, it is always worth a quick investigation! \n7. Ask your potential supervisor (and department graduate student advisor) if you have the ability to defer your start date to the fall. Oftentimes, GTAs are assigned at the start of the semester... so the lack of GTA positions could simply be because of the time that you anticipate starting the program. Ask the potential supervisor if they anticipate having GRA funding for you later in 2022 (or later in the program). It may be that they simply don't have funding for you to start in the Spring, but may have the funding for you to start in the Fall. \n\nNow, if you run from this opportunity, know that you can get acceptance to another program in the US! This is not the only opportunity that you will ever be given. Application deadlines are looming for Fall-22 start dates... It is well worth looking around at other programs at this time too, just in case! Some things that you want to ask potential future supervisors before applying to the program:\n\n1. Do you have funding to take on a PhD student in the fall? If not, do you anticipate having funding for PhD students in the near future?\n2. Does the department/university have funding opportunities for me?\n3. Who will be covering my tuition?\n4. On average, how long does it take your PhD students to finish their programs?\n\nI would also \"creep\" on some of their past students (if they have any). What are those people up to? What jobs did they manage to get post-graduation? Also, consider that at the moment, the US is just re-opening. The pandemic affected funding for *many* programs, and there's a bit of a bottleneck in the academic system. You may find more funded opportunities in a year or two... so don't get discouraged if you have a tough time finding another opportunity at this point in time! \n\nGood luck!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qin58l/have_i_made_a_mistake_should_i_leave/hikot0a/"}, "5503": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Pr0gr3s", "Date": 1635548401, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thanks for the update and I'm glad you are getting help.

On the flip side, my advice comes also comes from someone who was able to write out 3 chapters (chapter 1, 2, and 3) of my dissertation after I got my head out of my ass and successfully defend my 3-chapters all in a 5-6 month span. \n\nMy advice and opinions are as follows:\n\n1. Be honest with yourself in terms of the speed/time frame in which you can write each individual thesis/dissertation chapter. If that means in takes you twice as long to write a chapter, so be it. You know your study habits, personality, and personal schedule (balancing work, family, social life, classes, etc.) better than anybody else and your honest assessment of your ability to meet a deadline should hold precedent over your thesis/dissertation advisor's or cohort member's opinion of when you hypothetically should be able to meet a chapter deadline. \n2. The reason I say that creating a manageable and honest chapter deadline with your advisor is important is because in my opinion, missing a deadline is pretty disrespectful to your advisor. As graduate academics, we all know how busy their schedule is and they've not only done you a solid by agreeing to take you on as their advisee, but have allocated time out of their schedule to read over your thesis/dissertation chapter and give you feedback given you meet the deadline. Your word is one of (if not) the most important resource you have in life and if you keep missing deadlines, your word or promise holds no weight and you start to lose the respect of a person who you respect and care about. \n3. I can't stress this enough, but do not compare your thesis/dissertation speed/progress to that of your cohort members. This is not a race and there are so many factors that play into how fast or slow someone progresses in writing their thesis/dissertation such as: family obligations (taking care of husband/wife, children), job (having to work to fund graduate school vs. parents paying for graduate school), personal timeline (trying to finish as fast as possible vs. not in a hurry), and study habits (self-motivated vs. procrastinator). I also want to share my personal struggle here with this particular point. It was only after the second year of being done with coursework and writing my dissertation chapter 2 (4th year into my program) that I started to see many of my cohort members pass their 3-chapter defense and in some cases, finish their entire dissertation that I started to become real self-conscious, depressed (and struggle with mental health), angry, and even bitter toward my cohort member's success. Keep in mind, these were my friends and people I cared about. That was the wake up call I needed to stop comparing my thesis/dissertation progress to others and to just focus on me and what I could control. Nothing good comes from comparing yourself to others. \n4. If it helps, schedule a consistent check-in with your advisor if possible. I meet with my dissertation advisor either in person or on Zoom every month, even if a chapter is not due. In my case, I turned in a chapter every 2 months for chapter 2 and 3, and wrote chapter 1 in 2 weeks. At the middle point of each of those chapter deadlines, I  would meet with my advisor for a check-in and go over: (1) any questions I had for my advisor, (2) go over any problematic or unclear areas of my chapter, and (3) in most cases, my advisor allowed me to turn in what I had a week before our meetings for some early feedback on the chapter. The check-ins were beneficial because: (1) you keep in regular contact with your advisor, (2) your advisor sees that you are making progress on your individual chapters, (3) it's an opportunity for early feedback and answering any questions you may have, and (4) you're reassured that your headed in the right direction. The 4th reason was definitely important for me personally, especially in year 4-5, where my confidence was at an all-time low and I really started to question whether I could complete this dissertation or not. You'd be surprised how much a professor/advisor telling you that your on the right track or a section of a chapter was well-written means to someone. I know for me, on some days, it meant the world.\n5. To actually go back and answer your question, I would first have a \"look at yourself in the mirror\" moment, be honest with yourself, and ask yourself what are the barriers, distractions, or roadblocks that are preventing you from meeting a chapter deadline. When you've identified them, ask yourself if there is anyway to mitigate them, get around them, and lessen their impact on your writing progress. I would then make a very **realistic**, updated timeline of your entire thesis, with a time frame and deadline for each chapter. Again, if you need double the time or 2 months for each chapter, so be it. Lastly, I would E-mail your thesis advisor to ask if you can see she/he in person or over Zoom. The reason I say this is because I think you need to apologize for missing multiple deadlines, verbalize that you take full ownership for these missed deadlines, perhaps discuss with your advisor of ways to stay on task and motivated, and go over your updated thesis timeline (and deadlines). To me, one's sincerity can be better seen in person than via an E-mail. Just my thought. \n\nI know you can do it u/dead_people_are_cnts and while writing a thesis can seem like a herculean task at times, chipping away piece by piece is the way to go and when you start to see some visible progress on your thesis/dissertation, it not only makes you feel good about yourself, but makes you feel like you can actually accomplish the task at hand. Good luck and if you ever need to vent or talk about thesis progress or ask a question, feel free to message me.\n\n\\-Larry", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/qint42/im_late_again_with_a_thesis_chapter_for_my/him3jbn/"}, "5560": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "an6041", "Date": 1635574847, "Score": 6, "Body": "As a self funded PhD student in engineering also from a south-asian country in the US with no support from the advisor, I would be wary.

Regarding whether you should continue self funding or not, I would say, if your family will not be in a bad situation due to the cost, then go there for 1 year and try to get something while studying. When I arrived here, I have been sent many emails about open GA positions which aren't ideal but it is something. It's not guaranteed to get something but there is a chance. But if the cost would significantly affect your family's living conditions, you might try deferring this semester and talk to your advisor to try to get some partial funding at least for next semester. I deferred twice before coming because of the funding. My advisor was understanding and didn't want me to pay so he tried and managed to secure me full funding after I deferred twice.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qin58l/have_i_made_a_mistake_should_i_leave/himsbl4/"}, "5595": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bitparity", "Date": 1635594523, "Score": 9, "Body": "This is where journalism (of the old fashioned type) and academia have a lot in common.

Unfortunately, that usually means you get the short end of the stick, because what is best for *your* interests is not usually what\u2019s best for the university\u2019s interests. \n\nCombine these facts with a perpetuated cycle of toxicity (usually enforced by PI\u2018s)\u2026 and you get a recipe for continued exploitation. \n\nHowever, people are slowly figuring out you can be just as productive at 40 hours a week as 80 hours a week, and that aside from crunch time for important deadlines, it\u2019s not necessary to go overboard to succeed in graduate school.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qj2j9w/deleted_by_user/hip2ie3/"}, "5693": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "missdopamine", "Date": 1635632186, "Score": 2, "Body": "Definitely do it!

The PhD has been a job for me. That\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve looked at. Some days I\u2019m better at focusing on my job than others. I got to a point where I just wasn\u2019t sleeping and apparently the university had told international students to simply go home and work from home because of the mental strain. I\u2019m a dual citizen so I kind of slipped through the cracks on that one. By the end of April one of my supervisors noticed I was kind of losing it. I\u2019m lucky she did. She is in nursing though (I\u2019m a business student) so I think she is just more accustomed to noticing things about people that are left unsaid. Ended up having a zoom call with me and I just broke down crying. They told me then that I should go home and to work from my home country, that we would figure it out with the time difference. I got a plane two days later and ended up being home for a couple of months. \n\nI\u2019m back now and even though the country is technically opened back up and we can go on campus, a PhD is naturally isolation regardless of the global situation. In particular, those of us who don\u2019t have labs to work in or go, we are even more isolated because the reality is, unless we have a scheduled meeting for something or sign up for a workshop, odds are we aren\u2019t speaking to anyone or seeing anyone for days at a time. To be honest, my saving grace has been that I did an entrepreneurship program back in January and met my business partner. I\u2019m pretty sure that with out him and without our business, I could easily go weeks without speaking to another human. \n\nI miss my friends (and sometimes my family) and I\u2019m so far away I barely hear from them and if I do it\u2019s only because I keep messaging them, desperate for some sort of connection.
