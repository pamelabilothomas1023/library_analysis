You will have to jump through hoops, expected to network with people you don't like, pay for conferences (yes you'll get supplemented or stipends but not always), apply to scholarships and write in ways that might not be to your style, do university service for free, etc. Even with the application, you're going to have to demonstrate your fit with the institution in very traditional ways, e.g. GPA, lab experience, conferences, publications, references.\n\nNext, you say you're excited to be in your field. That's a great start. No, you don't have to narrow your questions when you first apply. No one expects you to know what you're going to do when you first enter the program. The first year or two is about you taking courses, opening your mind to different theoretical frameworks and methodologies, etc. Almost all the PhDs I know have changed their initial ideas of their research projects. In terms of merging a few fields, do your research about your university. Make sure there are faculty there who can support that kind of work, and if there are collaborative programs about the fields you're interested in. Programs vary widely. Reach out to certain professors before applying. (READ THEIR WORK!) Say you're interested in working with them. Find out if they're taking on new students, if they're going on sabbatical, if they're willing to meet for an informal meeting (some are, some aren't - not an indication of the program or actually who they are as researchers/supervisors), etc.\n\nIf you've still interested, onto the more practical aspects. You want the PhD, but does the PhD want you?\n\nNow the next part is, what's your GPA? Do you have research experience? Do you have at least 3 references you can readily call on - two academic, one professional? Can you write academically? Can you take those ideas in your post and write a coherent academic plan of study? Do you have publications? Have you ever presented at conferences? What are your academic skills? Do you have an idea of who you want to work with? How will you fit in with the department? Do you have an idea of the university you want to attend? Do you know the program? Do you have financial support? If not, are you aware of the scholarships that you will have to also apply for on top of your applications? They require references too. Do you have interpersonal supports? Are you willing to move? \n\nA PhD can be a huge lifestyle adjustment.

In this regard, I'll give you advice that I wish I would have received myself at the start of my PhD and be forced to follow (some might think this is obvious but I disagree).\n\n*Make the effort of organizing your research and build up a searchable knowledge base such that it requires minimal effort to do research*. This helps a lot with encouraging writing. I don't recommend printing stacks of papers that you highlight by hand. Searching through such a stack can be a nightmare if it extends to the ceiling of your office. In the beginning, it obviously won't be so hard but you're creating a future debt by adopting that solution. However, your milage may vary.\n\nInstead, keep track of what you read from the start using software like Zotero (you must not underestimate how quickly one forgets the details of what one read). It is an indispensable resource because the effort to save papers is basically 0 with their browser plugins.\n\nThen use the Zotfile add-on to rename the pdfs into a file on your dropbox (or some alternative backup solution). If you have a tablet you can find good pdf software that syncs with your dropbox where you can highlight the text (alternatively just read and highlight on your laptop). Zotero automatically extracts all your highlighting and creates notes. I use such notes to quickly recall what important bits I found in the paper. I further write on these notes some paragraphs I can copy/paste and adapt into my thesis. Finally, Zotero automatically builds your bibliography so there is less time wasted on such things (although you might want to be careful regarding consistency of journal name spelling or abbreviations, weird author names etc.).\n\nAlso, write, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_64lqpa.json"}, "162": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "atypic", "Date": 1491900375, "Score": 6, "Body": "Got this question during my defence!

I guess this is what you're supposed to have learned through your undergraduate research experience or especially through your masters research.  Obviously it would have helped to have more interested colleagues or friends but ultimately it's still just your work that gets you through.\n\nGiven the information at hand, my conclusion would be that you signed up for a PhD without knowing what would actually earn you the PhD.  Now that you have that knowledge, you can make an informed decision about whether it's worth wasting another year and a half of your life being miserable in order to get a degree that you probably don't really want anyways.  \n\nGetting better information, engaging in critical self-evaluation, and re-evaluating your previous choices is a sign of maturity and not something to be ashamed about.

What you should be focusing on is making the most of the time you have left. It's also not about increasing your hours in the lab per say (though that would be helpful); you want to be gaining meaningful experience that can prepare you for a graduate program and also build your reputation as a great student in the lab; quality, supported by quantity, should be the focus. When you ask your professor for a letter of recommendation for your applications, that reputation will be important and may be the deciding factor makes a recruiter pull the trigger on your application. \n\nI do not know your extra curricular involvement, personal situation, financial circumstances, etc, so obviously if you have other things going on that require your attention like family, personal health, or financial duties, this is not a reason to disregard those. However, if you are serious about applying to a graduate program for fall 2018, that needs to become the priority over the next 18 months. Your focus should be GPA, lab experience / work, researching/applying to graduate programs (this includes taking the GRE or whatever test the programs you apply to require). Everything else is nice, but nothing will help your application more than focusing on those three core ideas. Do exceptional in your courses, get great experience in the lab, and do your diligence when selecting what programs to apply to.\n\nAs an aside, what do you want to do when you graduate from a doctorate program? Where do you see yourself? What's you're long term goal with going to get a PhD (or a Masters)? \n\nIf you know that you want to work in academia, then a PhD is a good option. However, if you plan to go into industry or the public sector, is a PhD necessary for the type of work you want to do? If you don't know or it's not necessary, you're adding a minimum of 4-5 years of schooling to obtain a degree that you don't necessarily need. If you have a good rapport with the physics professor you've been working with or other faculty members, have a converstation with them about your career path and what you need to be doing with the time you have left, especially if you're moving from environmental to mechanical. \n\nTo properly address the change to mechanical, what programs are you looking at? When you research the programs, speak with the graduate advisors and ask to speak with some of the faculty. You should be able to articulate academic and professional visions that detail why you want to add a mechanical engineering doctorate. You'll also want to see if the faculty have research interests that align with that vision. While you're having these conversations and researching graduate programs, look at sample advising plans to see what courses are being offered; most public universities will post syllabi which you can view to estimate whether or not you can complete the program.
