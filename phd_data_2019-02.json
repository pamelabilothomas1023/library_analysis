It is probably best to talk to a neutral authority figure within your department where you can have a confidential meeting. They can help mediate things. Otherwise you have no power.\n\nYou are early in your program so you can recover if you want to stay at your school. True, switching labs within your own university is easier because you don't have to reapply to a new program. But at this point, you know what you want and believe in. But if you want isn't there, then maybe you can find it somewhere else.\n\nWith regards to this third party, this could be a dangerous situation. Because now, you are playing a conditional. My PI said to me today, \"maybe you can work with X collaborator the way we discussed, but during your fourth and fifth year, and not to the extent you want.\" FUCK that. These types of *possibilities* are the same tactics of abusive relationships, where you get hooked on a hope that is far from reality. You've obviously earned your salt in this situation because you care enough to secure funding for the research. But do you think your PI will change for you? And if your PI never cared to get you on something you've been motivated to start, do you think they will acknowledge that third party once you're gone?\n\nMy research is on a very cool topic, and I joined my lab because of what I *could* do with that topic. But now I know I won't be able to do what I wanted/agreed to do for my thesis. It's not worth \"being tough\" or \"putting my head down\" to become a scientist that I didn't want to be in the first place. I won't be competitive for the types of postdocs I'd like to secure, and I would be too far established in a field away from my interests as a faculty.\n\nYou clearly care about your research. Think about your options and your passions. This is your chess game. You chose to start playing this game and you can choose your next move. As my dad always said, there are no bad choices. Plans, in my opinion, aren't meant to happen; instead, they help direct you away from outcomes you don't want to experience. It's hard to think straight during a time as vulnerable as this where you're depressed/planning for your life/working 60-80 hours per week/figuring out how to do laundry and dishes on the weekends, but you have to come up with a plan. My advice is don't leave your lab or program empty handed, and don't let anyone decide who you are but you.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/adix1h/i_feel_like_i_was_catfished_into_my_phd/efhnd5n/"}, "1": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "left2myown", "Date": 1548989568, "Score": 2, "Body": "Just an update.

And then everyone seems to take a few years to actually complete their dissertation. \n\nI think my slower and steady pace kept me less overwhelmed, and mentally and emotionally available to work out my dissertation path while I was taking classes and exams. So now I\u2019m sliding right into my dissertation proposal (a month from now), and essentially on a similar timeline to being done as those who were more aggressive upfront.  Assuming my proposal is successful next month, I\u2019ll still have almost 20 months to complete my dissertation before surpassing that 6.5 year average.  Pretty reasonable in my book! \n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ambwfc/how_do_you_afford_life_while_getting_a_phd_in/efm0l7u/"}, "86": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "algooner", "Date": 1549138430, "Score": 3, "Body": "Great job!

My advice, is that if you cannot afford/stomach leveraging yourself, don't do a PhD. It is necessary to do so, because the goal is not simply to graduate, but to do so with publications which takes serious time and effort. Having a full or serious part time job sets you too far back from competition. If you have the skills/connections a bit of consulting on the side is doable.

I'd rather write \"Complete Section II of the report (x, y, z)\" (where x, y, z are references of papers you want to cite/summarize in your report). And if you're not at a point where you can clearly define tasks, well... Your next task should be \"Clearly define tasks\"! Or more like \"Think of a first plan for the paper\", \"Identify topics covered\", \"Collect papers on said topic\", \"Organize papers\", \"Quickly read (Abstract/Intro/Conclusion) them\", \"Discard useless papers\", \"Thoroughly read most important paper and write summaries\", \"Update plan\", \"Write bullet points with citations\", \"Go back to \"collect papers\" step\"... (Just an example for a literature review).\n\nThis might be beside the point, but if you tend to procrastinate a lot, having rituals and sticking to a routine is a good way to stay on track.

I've struggled with extreme procrastination and feeling stuck SO much throughout my PhD. Something I remember learning when I first started my PhD (I'm in my last six months now) is the TNT approach. TNT = The Next Thing. Often when I was frozen or unmotivated, it was because I was thinking about ALL the things I needed to do. It felt like I was staring into an abyss with no way forward. The TNT approach is about asking yourself \"what is the next thing I need to do, right now?\". It doesn't matter how small of a step it is. Say for example TNT is making a list of the things you need to read. Okay, do that. Once you've done that, ask yourself, what is TNT? That might be starting to read a paper. Do that. But don't get into the habit of setting yourself unrealistic BIG goals each day because you'll set yourself up for disappointment. Just focus on one small thing at a time. As you start accomplishing these small tasks, the motivation will follow and you'll gain momentum.\n\nAnother approach is to promise yourself you will \"show up\" for your PhD for a certain number of hours, regardless of what happens in those hours. And be true to actually being IN your PhD work within that time frame. For example, you might decide that if you spend 1.5 hours on your today, that will be enough (for now at least). So, set a timer, and do your best to show up for 1.5 hours. Whether that's skimming a few papers, creating a super rough outline... just show up. Once the 1.5 hours is done, you can confidently say that you showed up for that time. Sure, you didn't get everything you wanted done, but it was a start. Often though, once you start getting that little bit of momentum, the rest gets a little easier. Be sure to reward yourself, this is one of the strongest centres in our brain and one of the most effective at motivating us. If you finish that 1.5 hours, you get a cookie :)\n\nEither of these approaches usually help me get started again. I even have a to do list of \"easy stuff\" that is silly admin things to do or things like organising some of my folders. If I am feeling really unmotivated, I'll look at what I can do in the easy stuff column. Then I know I am at least doing *something*, and that makes me feel more motivated and positive about doing more.\n\nI've tried the beat myself up and scare myself into working approach, and sometimes, that works. But often, my output is very poor quality. So I opt for these methods instead :)\n\nOkay I'll stop procrastinating on my PhD now... ;) Hope this helps, you got this!

In this sense I think it's valuable to play around a bit and run your tests to see whether it integrates fine with your workflow/Word/LaTeX.\n\nApart from the fact that by doing so you can import PDFs (which you can always print if you want), underline them (to later find straight away the \"interesting parts\"), search through the text, etc... the real benefit is tagging, categorising and notes-taking.\n\nAs for tagging and categorising, again, just use a system that works for you. For me, I have divided my entries into \"meaningful periods of time\" (e.g. pre-fieldwork, 1st fieldwork, post-1st fieldwork) - this helps me quickly find the readings I need because I know when I have searched for them and used them; or you could divide them for the chapters (e.g. literature review, methodology). Same goes for tagging.\n\nAs fo notes-taking, that's the real advice I was given and that I feel worth passing on (and that software allows to do very easily). Every time you have read a journal/resource that you find could be useful and import in your library, write a small paragraph that summaries the core idea/the reason why you are keeping that resource. Very likely you will forget most of the stuff you read and you won't have time to re-read all the stuff again, so that's a quick way to be able to recall how you though that piece of work might be of use. \n\nAlso remember to make sure you fill up all the relevant information as you import/add entries...

Therefore, I forced myself to read all of those things, even though they didn't make immediate sense to me. And I didn't find them particularly exiting.

He did that for a three months until his supervisor caught him and asked for explanations. The supervisor was kind and understood the situation, gave him one month with clear deadlines each week: great! Great except the first deadline was an experiment, and the results were bad. My friend did the experiment, not procrastination this time, be it was just a bad result.

About two years ago, he'd been asked to be an impartial member of a hiring committee for a STEM field, and commented to one of the other committee members that he was concerned that none of the applicants had any single-author papers. The other committee member, head of a STEM department, responded, \"Neither do I. Do you?\" Neither of them, both academics who had been working in academia for 20+ years had any idea that other fields had different authorship norms. And why would they? Their academic friends tended to be within their field or related fields, and their non-academic friends had no idea. \n\nAs mentioned, I find this sub to be fairly foreign most of the time: I don't have labmates, I don't even have a \"cohort\" in the sense that it usually means here.

I moved from a large-ish city where I had lived for \\~10 years to a small town where I knew no one. I went from having a great group of close friends and a wide social circle to living on my own and having no one to talk to outside work, and even the work department was a lot smaller than my last one so not as many social activities or people I could become friendly with. I have been here about 6 months now. I have found it strange and difficult and sometimes I have questioned if this was the right move for me, as I am quite a sociable person, I don't like spending a lot of time alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would say that though it has been difficult, and at first I felt very lonely, you will probably find new friends. Making friends is more difficult after undergrad, but not impossible. It will take time and you will have to put in a significant amount of effort to spend time with your colleagues or go to activities in your new city and meet new people. I found it took a good 2 or 3 months of going to awkward social events before I managed to feel comfortable with some of the people I had met and feel like I could count them as a friend rather than acquaintance. Small cities can still have fun things going on in them, and if you meet some nice people you can start new activities or make new hobbies. Secondly, given that most people in academia are in this situation (having to move around every few years) you will probably find your colleagues are quite sympathetic and happy to reach out to you. If there are a few new people at once you could make a sort of 'newbies club' and invite them to come explore your new city together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, this is one of those life decisions we all have to make. Is your chosen career more or less important to you than your chosen home/social group? Some people chose to take a less prestigious position or adjust their role to stay close to friends or family, others are happy to go wherever it takes to secure their dream job, and it is a very personal decision as to what makes you happy and fulfilled in life. For example, I would happily accept a 2-3 year job outside of my home country while I am young but when I start looking for a permanent position I'm not sure I would be happy being that far away from my parents, because family is more important to me than my career. You will have to think about how you feel, and try not to let anyone tell you what you \\_should\\_ feel. Your personal priorities are entirely up to you and everyone is different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: final point - don't worry about committing to something and being stuck. If the choice is between changing career to stay where you are or moving and not being sure how you will feel, why not move to the small city, try it for a year and then see if you have made friends or if you feel you want to quit and go back to where you were, the alternative jobs you would have gone for will probably still be there. That is probably not the best thing to say to a prospective boss in an interview, but you are always free to change your mind later.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ath78r/career_after_phd_how_do_you_emotionally_handle/eh10lr3/"}, "1015": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AdanGarciaE", "Date": 1550848112, "Score": 10, "Body": "Is the PI the car or the streetlight?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/atigyl/studying_in_phd_feels_like/eh17n9i/"}, "1016": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "smadler92", "Date": 1550849343, "Score": 12, "Body": "PI is the car and your committee is the streetlight ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/atigyl/studying_in_phd_feels_like/eh19avg/"}, "1017": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jsredemption", "Date": 1550852191, "Score": 6, "Body": "Yes", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/atigyl/studying_in_phd_feels_like/eh1d8ry/"}, "1018": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "rysau", "Date": 1550861301, "Score": 1, "Body": "We're working on applying for funding for an undergraduate student this summer and/or fall. Our department has some restrictions on what independent lab study credits you can get if you also intend to do an honours thesis (and most of the students who are interested in research plan to do a thesis), otherwise that would be a fantastic idea.\n\nI am the person who does most of the ordering for my lab! We are a super small operation. For context: my supervisor has less than 30k funding a year, and it's me, a part time masters student, an undergraduate thesis student, and another PhD student who is being co-supervised and works largely in the other lab. My supervisor likes to give every new student their own project (including the high school student we had in last summer), but we've talked about someone to be at least part-time hands for me. Because of the lab's financial situation, I don't want my supervisor to have to choose between the reagents and supplies we need for experiments and whatever I think may help me work at a reasonable capacity in the lab. I've requested a free trial of a couple of pipettors, but they haven't responded to me yet.\n\nI'll take a look around for grants for students with disabilities, but most of my first hits are for students with permanent disabilities (mine is classed as temporary with the school right now). Part of my hopelessness is at the extent of the research I'll have to do for devices. I've done some of that about voice control programs, keyboards and mice, and I'm working currently on chairs and microphones. It seems endless, and with the internet the way it is now, I don't trust many reviews to be unbiased. It also takes away from valuable computer time that I should be using to process my images and streamline how I want to present my data (when I get it).

I took 18 months to write my thesis and I was not in the lab during that time. I now have my PhD and you will too! Here's how I prepped for it. I am in Canada and my PhD was in neuroscience, but I think the approach to studying is the same. \n\nKnow the big picture.\n\nBig picture questions will likely be asked first before they get to the nitty gritty. At this point in your PhD, you have already done the work, analyzed it, reanalyzed, graphed it, and wrote a fucking thesis on it. You know your data. But how does your data fit the big picture?  How does your data contribute to the field?  What are the next set of experiments you would want to do? Why? What would you do differently if you could redo it? \n\nKnow the literature that can contextualize your data. \n\nIf you say your data has scientific significance because it can help people or advance the field, then you'll likely get questions around how it can do that. Your answer should be referenced. Reference what clinical studies have shown and how your data is the next step. Reference what the field has done and how your data is the next step. You also want to be familiar with the references in your own thesis. In your thesis, you said \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (ref).\" Could you elaborate on this reference? What else did they show?   - this question used to freak the fuck out of me. There are hundreds of references in my thesis and they want me to be familiar with every reference??? No. They do not. But they do expect you to know (1) the references that formed your rationale, and (2) the references that formed your discussion. \n\nLastly, know your examination committee. For example, Examiner 1 has publications on fetal stem cells. Know how fetal stem cells could be applied to your work and how it affects your data. Examiner 2 has publications on stress and endocrine. Know how stress could affect your data. Examiner 3 you know nothing about. Ask your supervisor. \n\nEverything else, you already know. It's in your thesis. If you had to explain your thesis to someone, you could do it without thinking. \n\nAnyway, that's my 2 cents. Hope it helps but just remember, YOU ALREADY DID ALL THE WORK REQUIRED FOR YOUR PHD. The defense is the last step and you will rock it.

Four years (?) is too long a time to just stick it out.
