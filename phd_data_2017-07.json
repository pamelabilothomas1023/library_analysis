Take it VERY seriously. Every time you read a paper, put it in there. Read it and highlight it. Put notes in the notes section. Writing papers / your dissertation will be WAY more possible if you have this structure for prior literature. I WISH I started this earlier. Useful for all PhDs, necessary for adphds\n\n(2) You might have more structure your first year or two, but for me, years 3-6 were basically completely self-managed. I had no schedule or accountability, other than advisor / lab meetings twice a week. I would REGULARLY not go into work and go on an impulsive day trip instead. You NEED to pretend that this is a  9-5 / 10-6 job. Your peers with better executive functioning will let themselves have funkier schedules. I tried that and wasted 2 full years because I couldn't self manage. In my last year now, and am keeping to a strict schedule, no matter what.\n\n(3) Your advisor might ask you to write her weekly updates. If she doesn't, **ask her if you can.** I kept it short and easy, but the idea was I'd send the 1-3 big things I worked on this week, and my 1-2 goals for next week. **This serves two benefits.** One is extra accountability for you. The other is that **it shows that you're trying and trying to be up-front** by asking her to send these updates (and continuing to send them.) I legitimately think it gives you more sympathy / flexibility when you mess up and miss deadlines or have nothing to show for a week, which you will. If she is a good mentor (some are, some less so), she will follow these and give you advice, and help make sure you don't get off track.\n\n(4) Like I said above, you'll have days where you don't get anything done.

I actually met the publication requirements to graduate at year 3, but it was considered too \"early\" to let me go and they figured they needed to keep me since I had some additional promising data on a new project.  So here I am, end of year 5, being told that I need to push out this last paper before they'll let me go. :D  This insistence on pushing out the last paper has only grown stronger as   Alternately, a friend in my year got out after year 3 because her PI ran out of money--her continuation in the program was less advantageous to the department since she'd have to start completely over in a new lab.  Third scenario: a labmate of mine has 2 first authors and a couple second authors at the end of her 5th year and her committee is *still* trying to keep her for another year+ because its advantageous to them in various ways--she's been the go-to person for a lot of the new personnel training, and she's partnered up with a postdoc who is working under a collaboration between multiple PIs.  Being such a valuable asset to multiple ongoing projects translates into \"not being ready yet\" or \"just learn this one more technique before you go.\"\n\nThe NIH is trying to clamp down on this kind of thing to shorten programs, but the problem is that these programs don't provide students much preparation for actual working life beyond the postdoc track.  What good is a short program if you aren't employable afterwards?  This is why I so strongly advise fellow US PhDs/postdocs to take a hard look at what you're spending your time on and figure out if you're actually getting anything tangible and marketable out of it.  If your committee is pushing another year on you, spend 6 months of that in a non-university contract position or something.  If you listen to your PIs advice to never leave the lab, or you exclusively perform university-related part time positions, your CV will look like a \"perpetual student\" instead of a working professional.

I mostly stick to the \"standard\" method except that I migrate tasks weekly instead of monthly, because I need to frequently look over tasks to remember them. \n\nI also have a lab notebook where I keep all my research stuff, (I'm an experimentalist,) and I've started using a bullet journal system there, as well. Indexing pages has been a big help. \n\nFor both of these notebooks, I use colourful highlighters, because my brain finds monochrome text to be extremely boring, which makes reading difficult, and causes me to skip details. Highlighting helps with that; I can use different colours to add urgency to things, categorize things, etc. \n\nI use the iCloud calendar for stuff like appointments, my class schedule, remembering birthdays, etc. I also keep a calendar in my bullet journal, but anything that I absolutely cannot forget goes into the digital calendar. \n\nI have it set up as a widget on my phone so that I'm always up to date, and I also keep it in a pinned tab in my browser on my work computer. I would use Google Calendar if it had a widget on iOS, but unfortunately it doesn't. \n\nHabitica I use for habits that I have difficulty getting done, because it gives me an extra reward for getting tasks done. Stuff like doing the dishes, taking out the trash, etc. \n\nI also have a couple of habits in Habitica that are just titled \"finish journal task\" with varying degrees of difficulty so that I can also reward myself for anything I cross off my bullet journal without having to have that exact to-do task set up in Habitica. \n\nNow that I write this out, it all seems fairly convoluted, but it's working for me so far, at least in the sense that I'm not forgetting to do things.

How will you take/do the measurements/simulations (this'll turn into your methods and apparatus chapter/section)?\n3. What are your data showing you? Does it look like what you expected?

If a student is ready to hit the ground running and is highly self-motivated, then they should be able to make it out in 3 years. If a student is not as driven and has to have their research dictated to them, then they will likely take longer. \n\nIn my opinion, someone who is graduating with a PhD should be equipped to drive their own research.

Schools have a responsibility to (*i*) bluntly state they will be expected to drive their own research if they want to get out in 3 years, (*ii*) help students develop the skills to pursue their own funding sources for years 4+, and  (*iii*) not coddle students, as that ultimately would prevent them from developing the skills they need to be a leader in their field.  \n\nThis may sound insensitive, but if you expect to get a PhD in 3 years by simply going to class and doing exactly what your adviser tells you, then you are delusional.

It's small and medium (SME) business stuff, set in the wine industry (my real world specialisation).  My thesis consists of 4 free standing papers (plus intro, methodology and conclusion chapters).  My papers are: 1 explores lack of definitional clarity around the concepts like \"formal\" and \"informal\" in accounting systems. I review a fairly recent contribution in this space against the SME context, pointing out where their definitions don't fit but showing how their ideas are useful and important anyway; takeaway is that we need a broader, more contextually aware understanding of accounting systems when conducting research in the SME space.  2 considers the concept of \"sophistication\" in SME costing systems. Existing (survey-based) research has typically focussed on technical considerations. I bring the user back in and compare the technical potential sophistication of the system against the \"in use\" sophistication of the system. 3 considers stakeholders experiences of isomorphic forces in a patchy institutional field.  I was careful to this point to avoid jargon because I have no idea what your field is but I've just remembered this is a thesis.  Losing battle.  And you were likely just being polite!  But...  just in case...  there's a seminal paper in the field that shows how organisations tend to become more like each other over time (and then plenty more that argue they don't).  I examine four firms experiences with regards to an industry intervention that was intended to help them / would have made them more similar... but it didn't work.  So I look at whether they experienced pressures to comply / if not why not etc.  4 fits into the institutional logics space.  Other researchers have looked at how actants cope with competing institutional logics in given situations (eg it's appropriate to act a certain way in one setting, a different way in another; it's mental work to constantly balance / shift between the two).  Conflicting logics tend to get painted as exactly that: conflicting / in opposition / battling it out for dominance.  In contrast, I show that in the wine industry, key stakeholders (tacitly) understand that they need an appropriate balance between aesthetic (artistic) and market (commercial) logics.  Not only do they tolerate the co-existence of these opposing logics, they actively seek it out.  Partnering with someone who typically displays the opposite logic to you means you can reduce the mental load required to internally balance the representation - you can externalise it by bestowing power in a carrier of a conflicting-yet-complimentary logic.\n\nSo now that I've potentially embarrassed myself by delivering that murky mess of jargon that still completely glosses over stuff....    tell me, what's your area?

I would **love** it if journals would release their articles as .mobi or .epub files. However, it seems that PDF is here to stay and this causes problems for e-readers. Most e-readers will display PDF files, but typically this means that you're displaying it at 100%, so the text becomes rather tiny to read. \n\nThere is software, such as [k2pdfoft](http://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/), that can convert journal PDF files into e-reader files. The idea is that it strips out all the header and footer data and can combine columns back into one piece of text. In my experience it's overly complicated and needs to be finely tuned for each paper. This makes it very time consuming and frustrating.\n\nSorry I'm not answering your question positively, I just figured that I'd let you know my experience so you could decide if you think it's worth the effort (hint: sadly, it's not).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6qowut.json"}, "558": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Rhymes_W_Purple", "Date": 1501522209, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thanks for the reply and all the information!\n\nSince you haven't been liking your Kindle that much, how have you mostly been reading articles?

It works pretty well tbh, though it depends on the format of the journal (Science Direct articles seem to work the best) and probably requires some tweaking.\n\n If you're at the beginning of your studies I would recommend this approach because with the new Kindles you'll be easily able to look up terms you're not familiar with, you can place different papers into different folders and easily find highlighted passages.
