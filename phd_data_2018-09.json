I think for the purposes of your PhD, you do only need to understand how to run whatever tests you'll be using and how to design an experiment. I would suggest R instead of SPSS - it will force you to think about what the different tests do as you will need to specify arguments in the code to get the kind of tests you want (e.g. 2 vs 1 tailed or between vs within subject). Obviously this contrasts with SPSS where you can get by with just clicking without much thought. R is also free and widely used; your uni might well have someone who runs a course (I'm at a small English uni and found one).\n\nOnce you're comfortable with what a p value is and how to interpret your data, build on that.

Right now you should be reading with the primary aim of increasing your knowledge of the subject area with a potential publication as a possible byproduct, not the other way round. \n\nFind the most cited papers for each of your search terms. They are always a good place to start, as are other literature reviews of the area. Then look at citing papers of those. Look at what research questions have been answered in your field and what the suggestions for further work are. What gaps are there? Then when you get a bigger picture of the broader literature you can try get more specific information. Supervisors are academic staff and can often get very caught up in the need to publish as much as possible while forgetting that for you to publish you need to truly get a grip on the overall subject area first or you will never get through peer review.\n\nFor example - my PhD is on barriers to sustainable consumption and how to reduce those barriers and encourage people to consume more ethically. To start with, I needed to read about sustainable consumption as a whole. Then work out what the barriers were and where my efforts would be best focused. It was only from reading broadly did I find a way to narrow it down to what I was interested in, and only then could I focus on one specific barrier and look more in depth at that. That's when I focused more on methodologies and identifying what had been done and also what remained to be done. That then formulated the basis for my PhD. This process took probably 6-9 months. \n\nFinal thing - get ahead of yourself by starting with reference software now. I use zotero but any of them are good enough.

Unfortunately, you haven't specified in which field you conduct your PhD. Something related to social sciences? However, this is no reason to worry about. In fact, her advice sounds absolutely reasonable to me. In fact, I would have been absolutely surprised if your advisor would have specified the RQ for you. \n\nHere some points to keep in mind: Doing a PhD means that you contribute knowledge to the world that is entirely new (even if it is just a tiny little bit). This also means that your advisor simply cannot know the answer to \"how shall I specify the RQ?\" Because if she would know the answer to your question, the topic you are working on would be unpublishable (because not new anymore). You see what I mean? \n\nThis holds important implications to your work: You are mostly on your own. It is okay to feel afraid from this. Because in studies, you usually learn knowledge that someone else developed before. Means, you know that - if you just study hard enough - you will accomplish the task. But given the uncertainty that comes with the creation of new knowledge in a PhD, it is much less clear if (though, this mostly works!) and much more, when you accomplish your goal. It is crucial that you learn to focus and to work in this very difficult environment. It actually took me two years to understand (in the beginning it was not so crucial for me, because it was a well guided data collection) that I am on my own and that my advisor cannot help me with certain things. \n\nHaving said that, your relation to your advisor is still key for succeeding. Even if he cannot give you precise advice on how to specify the RQ, he can guide you in the *process* of refining the RQ. He can help you to make decisions on how to proceed and how to evaluate findings.

My main supervisor passed away almost a year ago. The only 2 times anyone talked to me about this is 1) the email directed to my group (in which I'm one of the only people who worked with him) informing me of his passing and 2) the conversation with the dean about who will be my new supervisor (ofcourse my only option being a professor I have worked with who had already ruined a large part of my PhD by making errors that caused analysis of 3 of my manuscripts to have to be re-run, and the manuscripts to be re-written).

It also expands your professional network.\n\nHowever there are some issues that are tied specifically to doing a phd abroad. \n\nMy german friends finish their phd after 3 years, whereas in the US there are additional course requirements that strech it all quite a bit.

This might seem like a weird thing to point out, but sooo many of my friends (and me) who went abroad 'only' for an internship ended up staying there because of a guy/girl. Which I personally think is awesome. But still something to keep in mind. \n\nAs final note: don't limit yourself to english speaking countries.

Hopefully, you can keep it up and build momentum to help you work hard.\n\n\nWish you the best of luck!\n\n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9dgmp6/about_to_start_a_phd_with_3_years_funding/e5pr5q8/"}, "299": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "planet710", "Date": 1536575558, "Score": 2, "Body": "That does make sense, thanks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9efys8/advice_on_starting_a_phd/e5psayg/"}, "300": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "silverporsche00", "Date": 1536584299, "Score": 1, "Body": "How difficult was it to get accepted?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9dzsvm/wrapping_up_my_mbaoptions_for_phd/e5py1i4/"}, "301": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TheKeenMind", "Date": 1536584519, "Score": 2, "Body": "You're in, no need to do things because of how they will look anymore.

I applied to about 15 schools.  Got rejected by 3 programs in the Top 10, got into one.  Got rejected by a program ranked about 25.  Gradcafe has a really good forum showing admission results including scores going back YEARS.  What you'll see is that lots of people with scores above the average for that school got rejected, and students with scores below the average got accepted.  Gradcafe will give you an idea of whether or not your current scores are \"in the zone;\" if they're not you can study and take the test again (I'm a fan of Manhattan Prep or Magoosh...Kaplan test prep is weak by comparison).  Programs receive hundreds of applications, so it's a safe bet that, barring something else like a professor saying \"we have to look at so-and-so,\" scores at the bottom of the pile get rejected right off the bat.\n\nNobody has a perfect application.  Few people have everything the \"perfect application\" will have (top test scores, published research, great letters of recommendation from leaders in the field, applicable work experience, etc).  My application certainly didn't have everything a committee might want.  Admissions committees are looking for students who will become researchers in the field, so I made sure to focus in my Statement of Purpose and interviews to explain why I wanted to be a researcher and why what I did have would make up for the things I didn't.\n\nI really benefited by talking to one of my professors as I was thinking about the process.  Definitely seek out someone to talk to about it.  Another one of my old professors destroyed my application essay twice and made it a lot stronger in the process.\n\nPlanning started in February 2017 to start a program in August 2018.  It was a ton of work.  100+ hours of studying to take the GRE again, plus the time to go retake the test.  Probably 10-20 hours researching different programs to narrow down the list.  Easily 100+ hours on the Statement of Purpose, writing, rewriting, proofreading, and then customizing my generic Statement to match the exact research fit and specific questions for each university.  A few hours each for any schools that had a second essay requirement.  2-3 hours on the application form for each university times 15.  20-30+ hours of Skype and phone interviews and a few days of travel for in-person interviews.  Over $1000 of application fees.  For a few months, it was like a second job.  Could it be easier or could you do it faster?  Probably, but I felt like I had to do everything within my control to give me the best shot.\n\n\"Difficult\" isn't the right word, because there's no guarantee that whatever you do you'll get in.  You do your best, do everything you can to stack the deck in your favor, but know that you might not get in to a program that you want to go to.\n\nFinal comment:  The lower down the ranking you go, the easier it will be to get accepted.  Makes sense.  The challenge is that when you look at where people land after graduation, everyone tends to \"slip\" a few notches in rankings.  So someone who goes to a Top 10 takes a job at a Top 25.  Top 25 gets a job in the Top 40.  Top 40 gets a job at a Top 60.  If you go to the #100 ranked school, you're going to have a tough time getting a tenure-track job at an R1 university. If you're okay with that, if you want to do a PhD and are okay getting a visiting position or teaching at an R3 university (and not really doing research) that might be great for you.  You might love your life teaching four classes a semester and focusing on rock climbing or canoeing and not publishing research.  If you're happy, that's great, and you got to spend five years reading and doing a PhD and getting paid for it! Before you commit to a school, look at where they placed graduates.

I completely relate to being overwhelmed and without prior research knowledge. I myself went from undergrad to PhD without much research experience (now in 3rd year, writing up, in social science). Even though I did an Honours thesis, I was unprepared for PhD level research. My supervisor is not always engaged/is always busy or missing, but we do connect well once I drive our interactions. A few points on what you brought up:\n\n* PhD experience is what you make out of it. Try not to become too stressed or develop negative feelings, rather try to see it as a great opportunity and get a handle on feeling overwhelmed by identifying why, and taking steps to rectify it? If research and methodology is an unfamiliar area (it really was for me!), there are so many great books around. (firstly, I liked Gray 2014, Doing Research in the Real World; if you are in other sciences I can't help sorry). I guess there's a lot of info out there on 'how to do a PhD ', but for me at the beginning I needed to find my own feet, so that meant reading everything (no matter how basic, even revising old undergrad material) and wading through until I came to a point where I began to have faith in myself, and was able to problem-solve effectively. Don't pressure yourself to know everything right away. It's a process.\n* Supervisors, especially at the beginning, know everything and don't know you well. Once you learn how to communicate with them, and how/when to take charge, things settle down (at least for most PhDs that I know). The first year is an awesome time to try out everything until you find what fits. (And in saying that, now in my third year, not much of that fits anyway, as it has all evolved and it's wonderful to have driven that process). You will always find out new information that replaces old, so don't pressure yourself to have it all figured out. Leave some room for open inquiry if you're unsure? And there is no shame in picking a 'safe' methodology which you can borrow from what exists. Even through this, you never know how you can develop it into something unique.\n* I am 3rd year and have no idea how to write a good intro. Awesome! At least I identify that, and can improve. Textbooks on writing can sometimes help... but a quick Google can serve this just as well. Then it's about practice. (And for your thesis, instead of writing intros last as many advise, I am constantly revising and writing over my intros for the practice).\n* the literature research can be really tricky. Are you at the stage now where you are expected to produce an in-depth literature review for approval? Lit review is massively useful even informally, just for yourself. I study in Australia and by the end of 1st year, we were expected to have a solid literature review to go alongside our proposal for approval to continue/do fieldwork. I had never done a literature review before. It sucked. Basically, it is an exploration and critical analysis of key ideas in your field. So, start with one idea, then the next which somewhat connects to that, etc. Avoid rabbit holes but also enjoy rabbit holes sometimes? If it helps, maybe 30% of material from my lit review is now relevant (but my entire research was very open, exploratory, and evolved way differently than I had planned). But it is such a helpful way to practice writing, and (I do this haphazardly) you can do continuous lit reviews throughout your PhD for your own reference and benefit. Lit reviews help your critical thinking, but also fill your head with knowledge and ideas (which are easy to forget about, should they become irrelevant).\n\nSometimes reassurance is as helpful as any real advice :) Everyone else here has also made some brilliant points!

A type of spacetime symmetry, supersymmetry is a possible candidate for undiscovered particle physics, and seen as an elegant solution to many current problems in particle physics if confirmed correct, which could resolve various areas where current theories are believed to be incomplete. A supersymmetrical extension to the Standard Model would resolve major hierarchy problems within gauge theory, by guaranteeing that quadratic divergences of all orders will cancel out in perturbation theory. \n\nIn supersymmetry, each particle from one group would have an associated particle in the other, which is known as its superpartner, the spin of which differs by a half-integer.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/PhD/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9i4d3r/writing_styles_and_changing_them_edit_as_you_go/e6j9pjg/"}, "749": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "andretheronsa", "Date": 1537767794, "Score": 16, "Body": "I am starting to think some of it comes from their insecurities...

My advice here is based off these factors as a self-funded graduate student who has worked full-time throughout my entire MA and PhD time, so YMMV. \n\n1. **Does your university have a legal office?** I ask because they might be able to weigh in on the exact language of the fellowship conditions. You might be able to keep some of the benefits depending on *HOW* the fellowship money is distributed. For example, some grad students in the labs were on fellowships similar to the ones you mentioned, but the money went to the school/PI, and the fellowship money basically just lowered the department/PI costs, but didn't eliminate all of them, and the fellowship recipients kept doing the same work and getting the same money as before. The only difference was on the finance office end as to which account the money came from. \n2. **Does your university/country have income requirements for social insurance?** If you were to accept a fellowship that lowered your income, would you qualify for some or all of these current benefits from another avenue because of a reduction in salary? \n3. **Are there minimum requirements that the school must provide for you?** A grad student in the physics lab had funding from a scholarship that didn't meet the minimum required amount for a grad student once the currency exchange was applied. The PI had to pay the difference. It was still less than fully funding this student without the scholarship. \n4. **Are there other scholarships or grants you could apply for?** I have sometimes had to use my own money, but have often found rather oddball interesting scholarship opportunities, and I'm not in the sciences. Some have been for $6,000 US and covered tuition only, some have been in the form of reimbursements if I got a 3.5 or better, some have been for $300 and had to be used for textbooks, etc. Often, these sources of money can be used simultaneously.

Everything is in one spot, both online and on your local machine, and gets the citation styles correct every time. You can annotate your papers and save them right in Zotero, too. \n3. **Ditigal Backups in Triplicate**: Hard drive, USB stick, Google Drive, DropBox, etc. At some point, something will get lost, and by having many backups, you won't have to have a panic attack. \n4. **Make friends in your program**: Even if you only have 1 buddy, it's worth it. They know what you're going through, and can be a great source of info as you go through grad school. \n5. **Make friends outside your program**: They might not be in PhD-land with you, but it's good to not fall down the rabbit hole of grad school too far. They can offer outside perspective and if you need to b\\*tch about school ever, it's okay as it can be a safe place to vent. \n6. **Take care of your health**: Keep eating well, and exercise, and sleep normal-sauce hours as much as possible. A PhD is a marathon, and you don't want to wear out after a year of breakneck work and research.\n7. **Pay attention to, but stay out of, department politics**: Some people are amazing to have as dissertation committee members, but not necessarily on the *SAME* committee. YMMV though, and this might be predetermined for you. \n8. **Get business cards**: They are great for going to conferences and symposia and stuff. \n9. **Keep your CV and Biosketch updated**: I've often needed to send something to an advisor or employer right away because of something they were doing, and needed my info for. Having one at the ready (updated per project or semester as needed) has meant not having to overhaul the thing or make others wait. \n10. **Read one dissertation a month**: I would find recent (last 10 years) dissertations in my field, my department, and that my advisors were a part of, plus those written by my advisors and professors, and take notes on them. Some of them have great data sources that I was able to look up, either because I agreed with it or wanted to refute it. By knowing what others have done in my department and university, it also let me know what format and length and style the graduate school wanted. It was also very helpful for formatting things like the literature review. As time went on, and these dissertations were turned into textbooks by their respective authors, I had the chance to see how a dissertation could be converted into a readable book, too.

So you can have quite a subject change, depending on your background.\n\n*The reason why I decided to do a PhD is my intended career goal - I would like to be a university lecturer. I say this to everyone who asks, only do a PhD if you need one for your career. If you can be the top of your field and make good money with a Masters, there is no need for a PhD. This a four year commitment that is incredibly expensive and emotionally, physically and mentally draining. This should only be undertaken by those who need it. Some may disagree, but I just can't imagine doing this \"for the fun of it\".\n\n*What does it take? This honestly varies dramatically. The only common theme I can see is commitment and determination. I would like to say intelligence but I've seen so many people produce work that is arguably less than intelligent and still get their doctorate. They say you need an original contribution to your field of research but this too is debatable. Also, have a look at the term 'imposter syndrome' - we're all faking it til we make it.\n\n*You will also want to take into consideration other life factors such as finances and family (parents, partner and/or kids). This will have a huge impact on their lives as well.\n\n*The application process varies from university to university. However, most will require some form of a proposal before they accept/enrol you.\n\n*I think your Masters is as close to doing a PhD as you can get in terms of experience. Not much else can give you a simulation of four years of literature reviews, data collection and analysis, and write up. As cliche as it sounds, not much can really prepare you.\n\nThese are just my opinions and experiences though. I know I'm not exactly screaming positivity but I'd rather not lie or make this out to be something it is not. \n\nA key thing to remember is that you may change - you may start this process and leave it later. That is completely normal and does not reflect on your intelligence or character. It doesn't mean that 'you're not cut out for this', it means you've changed your priorities - which is understandable. We humans are adaptable and changing creatures.

I'll tell you now that 3 years is a virtually impossible time span for a PhD unless 1) your MS was so directly relevant to your dissertation that your MS thesis can count towards your PhD or 2) you start out with a research project that doesn't change, stall, or get derailed at any point (pretty unlikely) or 3) you're a superstar with an awesome advisor who pays attention to you and is highly invested in getting you graduated quickly. I think you should expect the PhD to take 4-6 years and if you end up graduating sooner you can pleasantly surprise yourself. It's not uncommon for people to take much much longer...I know many people who have taken 6 years and some of those people had done their MS prior to the 6 years as well. It is highly dependent on your research topic, advisor, department politics, school requirements for TAships or non-research commitments, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat it takes to do a PhD...I think this can be interpreted in many ways. In the paraphrased words of a TED talk, the people who are most successful aren't necessarily the ones with the most talent or brains. It's the people with the most grit (a characteristic in which a person continues to put in max effort in difficult situations and does not crack or quit under pressure). I've seen people much smarter than me either quit or get kicked out of grad school because they couldn't adapt to make up for their shortcomings (e.g. a super smart student who never ever studied for his classes who failed an essential PhD exam twice because he didn't bother to study either time). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApplication process varies across institutions. Being in contact with a potential advisor to ask about their research, availability for future students, funding, can get you a leg up if the advisor decides they recognize your name in the admissions process and wants to vouch for you. This may vary with different admissions offices though, so more information about the type of program you want to apply to would be helpful. If you can apply for grants to fund yourself (because PhD students are paid, rather than payers of tuition), you'll have an advantage because professors will not need to fund you with their own grant money. In the PhD world, funding trumps all. I knew a friend who was accepted to a PhD program then got dropped because it turns out his supposed advisor didn't have the grant money after all and so my friend had to find a different school and program that would fund him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReach out to grad students at different schools where you are going to apply. Better if the grad students are working for a professor you might want to work with or if the grad students are doing the kind of research you want to do. Ask them some questions about their research so they have some tangible things to tell you (starting with vague questions like \"what's it like to do a PhD?\" and \"what do you do everyday?\" makes it tough to answer concisely). If the grad student is friendly and local, you might ask for an in person meeting or visit to their office or lab. If they have opportunities for volunteering, jump on that. If they're not local, you could ask for a Skype call and get a virtual tour of their lab which is pretty easy to do. Always end such meetings or emails with requests for them to connect you with other people in their network who they think would be good contacts for you. Either other grad students who work on research closer to your interests, or a faculty member, postdoc, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince we're in similar fields, you can PM me for more specific questions about my research and program, if you want.

I'm now in year 3 of probably a 5 year PhD program.\n\n2) What it takes to do a PhD? - I think this depends on the field, your project, and your advisor. I read a lot of horror stories on here, but I don't have any of those experiences. I have a balanced workload, I have time outside of work for my personal hobbies, and I don't find myself doing tedious tasks for other faculty. The biggest hurdle (in my opinion) is the serious of qualifying exams, which vary between schools. They are stressful, but if you start preparing well in advance, you should do fine.\n\n3) What was the application process like? - Very simple. I perused universities, faculty, and their research interests beforehand, emailed faculty who appeared to have similar interests to mine. Applications consisted of transcripts, standardized test scores, a personal statement, and letters of recommendations. Potential advisors then invited me out to visit the school. This is important - you want to meet who you may work with for 5 years, and you want to be sure you are going to like where you live. It also gives you a chance to meet other graduate students and get their opinions about the program.\n\n4) What can I do to get an impression of doing a PhD and how can I figure out whether I want to do it and can do it? - If you aren't already, it's good to learn how to be a self-starter and how to figure things out for yourself. My advisor helped guide me in the beginning, but a lot of the work I'm doing now is new to both of us, and it's on me to figure out the methods, how to collect the data, etc. I enjoy this a lot, so for me it's no biggie, but many people like to have more guidance. You can expect to be pretty independent as a PhD student. You'll likely teach for some duration of your PhD, and you'll write a lot of grants for money.\n\nAll my hydrologist friends in my program do a lot of programming and modeling. I'm not sure what your MSc is like, but I think you can expect to do that as part of a PhD in hydrology. Hopefully you'll have some field component. All but one of my hydrology friends has field work.\n\nMy final personal opinion - I enjoy my PhD work a lot. I don't have any major horror stories, just some annoying faculty. I think a PhD is an exciting experience, and it's useful even if you aren't interested in teaching.

After school, I got into Bachelors in Electronics and midway through it, I realized I want to study stars. So, I switched to physics for my Masters and finally made my way to PhD in Astrophysics. I defended last week, working on minor thesis corrections. It was a three year PhD program.\n\n&gt; What it takes to do a PhD?\n\nMost importantly, perseverance, I would say. Knowledge is kinda secondary, since you learn a lot and can't know everything which already exists, depending on your field. Since it's research, things could go in an opposite direction than you hoped or expected and *poof*, a year's worth of work would feel like a waste (it's not, though; a failed experiment also gives you a result - how it does not work). In these moments, you will need to just keep going on. Just like life, I guess.\n\n&gt; What was the application process like?\n\nIt varies based on countries etc. I applied mostly to European countries from a job register of my field. Just mailed my supervisor the things he asked for. Got shortlisted for an interview over Skype and then, another 'formality' interview with a team from the university. My supervisor had applied for the funding for this project and after getting it, he posted the ad; so he had enough money to pay salary for a three year PhD.\n\n&gt; What can I do to get an impression of doing a PhD\n\nGet into it, maybe? Honestly, there is no simulator or anything where you can replicate this experience. And also because it varies from person to person, depending on so many factors like supervisor, lab, project, funding, personal issues, support from people...\n\n&gt;  and how can I figure out whether I want to do it and can do it?\n\nFor the part \"can I do it\" - unanswerable until you start and see for yourself, how it is for you. And for, \"if I want to do it\" - I guess you need to contemplate about it on your own. If you do it for money (there is not much money, anyway), forget about it. If you do it just because you do not have anything else to do, forget about it. The only thing which you need to continue in a difficult program like PhD is proper motivation. Also, know that your motivation can betray you, so you need to provide yourself with a proper reason of why you are doing it.\n\nI know I left many of the answers open in a way that you need to figure it out on your own, but that's how it is. Like life, there is no manual. My advice? If you really want to, get into it and if it doesn't work, remember it is not the end of the world for you, you can always get out of it whenever it becomes too much for you.

I loved the fact that I could simply work whenever I wanted and I got really passionate about it. I worked up to 12 hours on it per day and I loved it. I graduated with gaining a reward for the best Master thesis of my cohort. So I thought \"well, why not doing this for another couple of years?\" Also, I always thought that a PhD might be something that would suit me, though I initially thought I would do it later on the job or in a sabbatical. \n* I basically think there are a number of super important points: \n   * Ability to deal with frustration. The amount of times something doesn't work is much much larger than the number of \"breakthroughs\" you have. You actually need to frame your failures as successes, otherwise there are few positive experiences you make. \n   * Ability to deal with very limited feedback and with taking major decisions on your own. As a matter of fact, no one tells you what to do. You shape it yourself. So, if you are fine with working and just diving in without any direction from a boss, it is a great place. However, I see from my Master's students that this happens rarely. Mostly, Master's students start to freak out and feel lost if me as a Master's advisor is not giving them precise instructions. So, I think your experience with working on your own in your Master's thesis will tell you quite a lot about your PhD later. \n   * Being disciplined. People always think that it is about having the one big idea, like Newton and the apple falling on his head. In fact, you make many many tiny little steps. And to take them, you need to have the discipline to crunch the data even another time and to read up even more and deeper. And that requires hours of disciplined and focussed work.\n* My application process was really straight forward. There was a job opening, I applied. I was invited and I had 3 interviews. One with the prof, one with the senior researchers, and one with the other PhDs. They asked me different questions, but it was not nasty and I didn't have to take a test or entrance exam. \n* I think your MSc thesis is a good indication, in case you plan to stay in the same field or even with the same research group. Another good way is to talk to people that are active on the field you are interested in. Check conference attendees from fields that interest you. Contact them (in particular the PhDs) and ask them for their experience. I am sure you will get feedback. People in Academia are usually very friendly. \n\nI hope my answers helped you.

Better grades and references or even some papers will increase your probability of being hired, but those are not fundamental.\n\nMore vaguely; it takes a degree of intelligence, work ethic, and the ability and willingness to learn and adapt. If you enjoy following lab protocols and getting nice results and panic when this does not happen, you might not want to consider a PhD, because you will be the one inventing the protocols, which by necessity means that most of what you try will not work. Failure becomes the default, success the exception. If you are the type of person who takes every failure personally (many in my Master's cohort were) then you are not going to have a good time.\n\nYou don't really need to know much about the specific subject. All PhDs are hyper-specific anyway and you will have to learn virtually everything on the job anyway.\n\n&gt;What was the application process like?\n\nHere it is almost identical to applying to any other job. You send resume, cover letter and a bunch of required documents (typically diploma, grade list and occasionally thesis). Based on this they make a selection for interviews. Usually some part of the interview process is giving a presentation on your Master's work for the department.\n\nMy grades were not fantastic, but I had two published papers from BSc and MSc work so that helped a lot.\n\n&gt;What can I do to get an impression of doing a PhD and how can I figure out whether I want to do it and can do it?\n\nThe closest approximation I found was doing the MSc thesis. Except doing a bunch of them back-to-back and you have a higher degree of responsibility over the outcome and overall just need to bring it to that next level of competence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to hijack /u/MINE-End-This-Way's comment;\n\n&gt; Some may disagree, but I just can't imagine doing this \"for the fun of it\". \n\nI'm one who disagrees, but that may be an artifact of my surroundings. Here, a PhD position is a full-time job (literally, you are no longer a student) with benefits (6 weeks paid vacation, 16% yearly bonus, pension plan etc) and a decent guaranteed salary (80-100% of median wage incrementally over the years) for 4 years. So for that reason people can afford to do it here \"instead of a real job\".

I decided I wanted it when I was around 10 years old.\n* A PhD in the US is typically a 4-7 year process. It involves 1-2 years of classes, with the remainder focusing as much as possible on research. Depending on your program and funding, you may also spend some time teaching classes.\n* The application process is heavily varied. For me, it involved a basic application form, GRE scores, and 3-4 recommendation letters. If you make it through the first round you're often invited to visit. Sometimes this is paid for, sometimes not. During this time you can meet with various group members or even potential advisors.\n* And now for the hardest question:\n\nWhether you want to do it is a hard question. My typical answer for people looking for a (science) PhD is: \"if you aren't sure you want it, don't get it.\"   \n\nA professional degree like an MD is very well-defined. If you want to be a (medical) doctor, you need this degree. It has a pretty well-defined ROI as well, where you know you'll spend about $200k and 4 years in school, plus 3-5 years making $50k in residency, and then you're making a lot of money for the rest of your career.  \n\nBut you can be a scientist without a PhD. You can even be a researcher without a PhD. And the pay difference between someone with a PhD and someone without it but with 4-7 years of experience is not that large. So from my perspective the main reason to get a PhD is that you know precisely what you want to do, and it requires a PhD to do it.\n\nSo ask yourself: what do you want to do? Will a PhD help you do that? If the answer is no, don't do it.

It also gives you opportunities to Skype with potential advisors, have phone conversations, etc. One misconception when people reach out to advisors who don't respond immediately are that that advisor doesn't care. This isn't true, most are simply very busy, and a prospective student email is easily skipped over by accident. You may need to wait for a couple weeks before reaching out again to express your interest. Good questions to ask are what the advisor's research interests are in, their current funding status, the availability of teaching assistantships, and where their students typically go after their PhD (post-doc, academia, industry).\n\n&gt; For my BSc thesis I also did field work, but it was poorly set up, so the measurements I did were okay, but I had little confidence in it, because it could be so much better with the correct equipment and more time.\n\nThis is another good thing to ask about - what type of work their lab is doing. You can ask about their lab work/coding/field work balance, the equipment they use, and even ask for pictures of them in the field.

Well, when I'm already working, I keep focused by using the pomodoro technique, where I work for 25 minutes, or 50, with a timer going that then gives me a 5 or 10 minute break, respectively. Everything else off--email, facebook, reddit, etc. I have music on but never with lyrics (lofi chillhop radio ftw!). I like this technique because I can have structured, frequent breaks and I'm not tempted by distractions if I know I can have my fill soon.\n\nIf I'm trying to work, but I'm not motivated at all, I will be honest and say that it depends. Some days I need to get more done and I have to force myself. But I also know when there's just no energy. I will try to get *something* done -- if I had planned to read 3 articles or write 10 pages, then I may try to just start reading and see what gets done. I force myself to start is the point. Often I can get rolling once I do. But other times that article takes me way longer than I expected, or writers block is heavy that day. \n\nIn moments like this I'll just be honest with myself--if a deadline is looming like for real, then I'll push through. If not, I'll embrace it. The beauty of forcing myself to start means that I've likely gotten *something* done I can feel a little good about. And so I'll take a mental health day. When I do that, though, I **truly take a mental health day.**\n\nThat means: I don't play video games. I don't drink beer and watch sports. I don't binge Marvel shows on Netflix. I'll read for pleasure, go to the park, visit a thrift store to find something fun for the house, etc. I'll really try to not feel down on myself about taking the day.\n\nDefinitely suggest you not stay up all night guiltily working. Far better to try and force yourself to just do good work. I can share more ideas but it'd be easier if I knew whether your problems were more the \"starting at all\" vs. \"Getting distracted midway\" variety.

I finished my qualifiers and started working on my thesis. \n\nI had pretty much the same scene. It was weird because I am among the youngest in the department. That creates a problem - your priorities in life and those of your colleagues are way different. Initially I thought this was a race thing and then I realized that some of it was but mostly my colleagues are Americans. Unlike me their entire life was in the US and they had kids and family. So hanging out with colleagues didn't really happen much. \n\nI watched a lot of movies, YouTube,Netflix etc etc but after a point of time it was going all down South. I remember during one Christmas, it was snowing and for a period of 10 days - I did not see a human being and the only conversation I had were with my mum and girlfriend and both of them were back in India. I ate crap and put on weight (something I am still struggling to lose!). All of this happened in first year. It was all the more pathetic because I don't even remember spending a single Christmas alone back in India and am not even Christian.\n\nIt took some time to settle in. I used to think that it's just me, then I found out that a substantial number of Indian students going to the US and Europe have had mental health issues. For that -you need to go get professional help. Thank your lucky stars that you are not in India and go and unabashedly use that help!! the\n\nI didn't need the help - though now that I think about it, maybe I should have. However, I survived that period. When I started next year - I told myself that PhD or no PhD - I am going to live! I started working out (am still obese but I couldn't do 10 push-ups and now I can do 30!!), re-started playing pick up football(soccer). I also started skating during winter. From hating the winter, I now can't wait for winter to come in because I can skate then. A knee injury derailed my plans of playing ice hockey but I'll be there soon (just like Charlie Conway!). Also I pushed myself to attend events - am moving further and further away from religion but I help out with tutoring at a Black church. \n\nBasically, I did what came naturally to me - sports and mixed it with some experiences that I did not have had before. I did not think I would meet so many Black people and get to know a lot about their lives. For me,it was a new experience! \n\nWhile I would suggest that you take help, I would also say - live beyond the PhD too. A professor I worked as GA for told me once -\" it's important to work, publish and finish your thesis but you need not have to stop living to do so\". I did take his advice -some of my friends said that it was white middle aged man giving you that advice, he could afford to do so. Maybe they were right,maybe they were not, in my context -the profs's advice was spot on! \n\nBest of luck Habibi! : ) \n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9k18h6/phd_curse_stress/e6wmvet/"}, "993": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jzhang22", "Date": 1538318334, "Score": 3, "Body": "Can't emphasize this enough.
