A good friend of mine (master student in psychosocial sciences) told me recently that Foucault described this in his discourses theory (sorry if reference is not properly described, but I heard this only once): society is at a point where the individual starts wanting to increase their productivity at the expense of their natural life rhythms, sacrificing down time, human relations and emotional health. This is ideal for governments and control infrastructures as the individual is not listening anymore to their \"gut feelings\", which often is the one telling you to take a weekend off and work on your personal growth in other fields. \nMy opinion is that working weekends are a silent buy-in condition when you do a PhD. Nevertheless, this forces you to work on a balance between the time you spend on your education and the one you spend for your health and energy. As a PhD in a scientific field, I am now used to think of this work/life balance in a very rational way, trying to savor every second I spend with my friends and loved ones and giving weight to the feelings I get from my body.

I'm honestly really skeptical that working these kinds of hours actually leads to quality results and academic/career success down the road, but that's the culture many of these PIs grew up in and took away as a template for training their own students. The whole attitude of \"well, I had to go through it, so my students will too\" and all that. \n\n*However*, a big silver lining here is that it sounds like you like the research in this lab much more compared to your old lab. That will be a big plus. On top of that, what kind of vibes do you get from the new PI? Are they someone you could see yourself enjoying working for? It's one thing to be pulling long hours working alongside people you like and respect, but another entirely if you're working with a sociopathic micromanager with the charisma of a doorknob. That said, I'm a bit skeptical (based on \"isn't uncommon\") that 14-16 hours will be the norm outside of crunch time/deadlines. Seriously, it's not possible, and in fact, downright dangerous, especially in a synthetic lab, to sustain that kind of workload over any period of time without burning out, ruining your experiments, or injuring yourself.\n\nIf I were you, I'd go in with an open mind and give this lab a shot for a couple months, at least. Who knows, you could end up enjoying it, but if it ends up not working out because of mismatched (and IMO unhealthy) work expectations, in a toxic lab culture, that's not on you. But if you do have to end up putting in long (if not quite 14-16) hours, doing work you enjoy with awesome people, well, hey, that's not so bad in the grand scheme of things. You can stick that out for a couple years and get the PhD. It's kinda cliche to say, but you really get only one shot at a PhD in life.

After one employer basically told me I'm a moron, I thought \"You know what, I'm not a moron. I bet I could do a PhD in physics if I wanted to.\" It wasn't specifically, or solely, why I decided to go back to school (I dropped out of high school when I was about 16, and went back in my early twenties), but I'm sure it contributed.\n\nAnyway, I figured that I have strengths and weaknesses. I'm terrible at a lot of the things required for 'unskilled' work, such as communication skills and thinking on my feet in a dynamic environment, but I'm also pretty intelligent and hard working. I get obsessed with certain very narrow endeavours, and can achieve a lot with technical things.

I wanted to get a PhD, some other stuff would happen, and then I would be successful. I figured that when I go for a job, I would be at the top of the pile for graduate type jobs, because of the PhD, and that they would overlook some of my shortcomings (many of which are very apparent during the interview process). What I didn't realise is that the further you go in education, the higher the expectations are on *all* fronts. They expect you to be way more on top of shit than when you're working in hospitality or anything else like that. Having a PhD doesn't seem to offset any of my shortcomings at all. If anything, it may be making things harder. I apply for so many jobs, and it's hard to know why I get rejected all the time. I suspect many people see PhD, and assume I will expect a high salary, or that I won't stick around. The only jobs where I'm even considered are ones where I'm up against other PhDs, and then the same problems with my shortcomings come into play.\n\nI did actually score one job during this time. I liked the work, as it was mostly coding and data analysis, and the pay was good, but things didn't work out for the reasons I've described, so I'm back at square one.\n\nI recently got diagnosed with ASD, which explains a huge amount about why I'm very good at some things, but terrible at many of the things that seem to be a baseline requirement for almost *any* job. So yeah, don't take my experiences as being what you should expect after finishing. My situation is not the norm (although admittedly ASD is probably more common in PhD students, especially in tech, than the general population). Most of the people I went through the program with just went and got jobs, started their own companies, or continued in academia. Whether they are mostly \"super fucking successful\", I do not know, but everything mostly works out for most people who do a PhD (in science, at least) from what I've seen.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/c96kr5/same/esu8llx/"}, "230": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jerryskids_", "Date": 1562279817, "Score": 0, "Body": "But my parents said follow my dreams and because I am special right now I will just be something super special later...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/c96kr5/same/esu8xlq/"}, "231": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "HeAbides", "Date": 1562281316, "Score": 1, "Body": "Ahh fair fair.

I wasted a lot of time to the point of almost quitting the PhD because of lack of structure. From the point of view of things I can control, why I failed initially was because for a PhD student, there is a long gestation period for our results to show. So we work for years at a time without seeing results, and sometimes without people guiding you, it might feel as if we are going in the wrong direction. It results in us not completing the program and then going through one existential crisis after another. What the lack of structure does is that it exacerbates the problem. It is not THE problem. But deliberately creating a structure that works for you enables you to move forward.\n\nI made a series of changes in my 3rd year that helped me do this.\n\n(1) Eat, sleep and exercise at regular times: I was obese, so that's probably why exercise helped. I started walking, built up to enough fitness to join a gym and do light cardio, from then I slowly upped the intensity over a period of 18 months, now I can do decent strength training 3 days a week as well with high intensity cardio. At the same time, I was able to cut down all unhealthy foods over a period of time, eat only home-cooked meals and also lower the portions of all meals so that I don't binge eat. This automatically transfers to great sleep as well. Eventually I am now at a place where I don't need to use an alarm clock. I sleep on time, and I wake up on time, well rested and I don't feel bloated. What this helps with is increased concentration, and higher bursts of productivity when you have limited time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(2) Mental side: There are many things you need to fix on your mental side to ensure that when you work, you work with complete concentration. Write down all other tasks you need to do, personal or work-related or chores so that you can let those things go when you are reading or writing. When you write, be absolutely committed to the task at hand. Nothing else matters in the world. Not feeling in the mood to write is an excuse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(3) Writing schedule: Find a writing schedule of upto 6-7 hours a day of total productivity so that you can get your other work done as well. This can be at your convenience. I usually do 2 hours in the morning and 4-5 hours in the afternoon/evening mostly to incorporate my other commitments (I have some consultancies and also some personal responsibilities).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(4) WordCount: When you have papers and a long dissertation to do, you absolutely MUST write. Don't wait till the last year to start writing. Make writing a habit. If you don't write at all, start with 200 words a day. Consistency is key, just like physical exercise. Don't put too much on your plate. See what you can manage now, and then slowly build your pace and productivity. Be totally committed to your WordCount or reading for the day and decide on the day's task the previous night so that you don't waste time browsing online and surfing journals and books. This is basically a problem of doing academic work in the information age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(5) Give yourself a break: A PhD or a great career is not your life. You do these things to enhance the quality of your life and also as a commitment to larger society. So when you do these things, put yourself mentally and physically, the best position to do so. There will be days when you sleep late, wake up late, fall sick, etc that does not allow you to follow your routine. Give yourself a break on those days and get back on song ASAP so that you don't waste anymore time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlways make sure you are making progress everyday.

A recent paper by a UK institute which looks into phd graduation and movement into industry found that PhD students were seen as over qualified but also incompetent compared to an undergraduate with any level of experience. Transferable skills while also touted by institutions are found in undergraduate degrees so post graduate degrees did not add employability and in fact 4 years out of industry had harmed likelihood for employment.\n\nOn the bright side PhD have a 99% employment rate according to the UK department for work and pensions but on closer inspections this usually means getting entry level jobs not related to their field which they could have got after finishing their degree.

Say we have a lecturer with a career of 35 years from 30 to 65 assuming they did two post docs after their phd as is normal. This is totally reasonable. Also assume they have a regular stream of PhD students over that period. We will say 10 so 30 years of their 35 they have a phd student which matches. We will not assume they have two or more students, although this is very normal, as my point is easily proven with just one student. This means we have 10 students over that period and the lecturer hasn\u2019t gone anywhere so no job has opened up and even if the job does open up at retirement it is for a senior post so a phd/post doc won\u2019t fill it. That means  over the course of a career we are producing 10 more candidates and only one spot.\n\nNow lets add in departmental size and growth. We will have 30 lecturers, arbitrary number, and that means over 35 years from say 1990 to 2025 we have 300 phd students. The department grows 20% in that time, that means we now need 36 lecturers, and that is considerable growth we have 6 employed phd students and 294 non employed ones. My department is much bigger with 60 lecturers and most have 2-3 students at a time so 1800 phd students over that period.

I make just enough to where I can do it.\n\nThe key for you is going to be working smart.  Use projects you have done for work in class- that kind of thing.  You will get a lot out of it, but it is a slog.  I hope to be done with coursework by the end of next fall (2020), and Im looking at it in steps like that.\n\nI would start looking at the usual online places for jobs in higher ed and see what is there currently to give you some idea.  I don't know what your situation is, but if you are willing to relocate then that definitely helps your options.  Also, most places are going to give you the opportunity to teach online as well as on campus, so that could be a way to supplement income as well.\n\nI have pretty well resigned myself to the idea that I will be consulting as well as teaching/research wherever I end up in order to make everything work.  I think it is worth it, but it is not easy.  I would look at your situation as an advantage, because in my case it has been one.

So all in all, you can just fall back to these few questions for everybody, it will get the ball rolling and you\u2019ll get a feel for the person you\u2019re talking to and his/her work.\n\n- Be genuine. Don\u2019t just look interested, be interested. When I open with \u201chow are you\u201d, I really want to know more about the person. Don\u2019t feel obliged to talk to everybody all the time, it\u2019s okay to just sit somewhere and \u201crecover\u201d from a socially draining day. But when you talk to somebody, do it with pleasure.\n\n- Exchange contact info. Business card, twitter, email. Getting to know somebody just to realize I\u2019m six months you can\u2019t join this person is... too bad. So ask people how to get in touch, and give multiple options.\n\n- Be open about how you\u2019re feeling. You\u2019re not good in chatty environment and loud places? No problem, just say it so it won\u2019t be awkward later. I started a few gala dinner with \u201cwow, the place is beautiful but pretty loud, I\u2019m not a native speaker so sorry if don\u2019t catch everything\u201d. Else I\u2019m just gonna stress thinking that people are gonna think I\u2019m deaf (but in reality, you\u2019re the only one being so critical with yourself). I usually do the same if my mind start wandering mid conversation: \u201cI spent 7 hours in the train, I\u2019m super tired and spacing out a bit, sorry\u201d is a simple way to avoid any misunderstanding and awkwardness.\n\nAll in all, don\u2019t worry. Everybody\u2019s here for a common topic so it\u2019s easy to strike conversation.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cdvm32/first_networking_event_next_week/etws42f/"}, "917": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Elesday", "Date": 1563282706, "Score": 3, "Body": "I don't get the problem: is it a lack of access to those DBs, or the fact that another team is working on the same subject?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Scihub can't get you access to what you're looking for?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cduouu/help_me/etwsbsa/"}, "918": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Cookies_Policy", "Date": 1563283124, "Score": 1, "Body": "The main problem is the lack of acces to those DB.

They gave me some names, and then I went about researching on my own, checking the top ranked schools in my field, and looking for people who specialized in what I was interested in. You should also check to see, while you\u2019re scrolling through names of faculty, where those faculty come from and check to see if those departments have phds in your field. (I am in media studies on the humanities side, so lots of the profs came from comp lit departments and the like, so it was a bit of a needle in the haystack looking for programs.)\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that for every program you highlight as being potentially useful, you should contact them. You can learn an awful lot about a program based on whether they return your call/email, and how they treat prospective students.\n\nI also want to respond to one of the above comments. While I agree that you need to have passion about your project, I don\u2019t know if at the onset you need to be hyper committed. Partly this is due to the fact that you might not know what your interests are. (My own interests pivoted from film studies to science and technology studies based on what I was drawn to and who was most supportive in the department.) the other part is that I worry the \u201cif you don\u2019t have the passion for this you won\u2019t cut it\u201d is a means of deflecting the responsibility of the department (or school or whatever entity which governs your education) back onto the student, instead of promoting a healthy productive environment. With a good support system you will find your interests, and you will be able to execute them in the time expected. ((There\u2019s further concern about the potential job market, that if you don\u2019t work hard enough you won\u2019t find a job, but I am wary of that logic since it is pretty easy to debunk any notion of meritocracy on the job market.

You'll be expected to stand on your own two legs, have your own ideas, and be much more independent than you were during your PhD.\n- Related to the above point, same thing about the university. Your publication record in your field will matter a lot more than where you do your postdoc, especially if you're going into academia. Hiring committees won't be impressed if you have a postdoc at a prestigious institution and no publications on your CV.\n- Doing a postdoc in a different field than your PhD has its plusses and minuses, so there's no definitive answer on that. If you have the skillset to get started quickly, then it could really open up your mind to a new way of thinking, broaden your profile in a good way, provide you with new connections, publish in new journals, and also use what you've learned from your new field to improve your knowledge of your old field.\n\nMy conclusion: You've heard this all the time in academia, but the right answer here is \"it depends\".

I'm in the final 4 months of my PhD (psychology, Australia) and this stage is pretty much 'pushing it' to the finish line. For me that means about 10-12 hours a day. I basically have to write a discussion chapter, intro, two manuscripts and put the damn thing together (linking, style, structure, references) and that's all on top of some clinical work I'm doing. So yeah it's hard work. \n\nThere is a lot I wish I knew before I started but then again, this process is very personal and I could only really 'figure it out' by jumping in head first. \n\nWhen I began 4ish years ago, I was under the illusion that a PhD is just a natural progression from a masters. That is not so. While the nature of the outcomes may be similar, the process is not. Basically, a PhD is like doing an internship to be a researcher/academic. It is about figuring out how you (with hopefully great support from advisors/supervisors) can be a researcher in your own right. \n\nHere are some key things that pop into mind that you should remember for your process:\n\n-remember the relationship with supervisor/advisor/s is vital. Learn to know what sort of support you can expect and how to reach out and ask for help when you're struggling. Also, keep in mind when picking an advisor, just because they are a great/well respected researcher doesn't mean they know anything about being a mentor!\n\n-the things that you do in your life 'around' the dissertation are just as important as setting aside time to write. What I found, when I was teaching and doing RA work and having imposed structure to my week, I felt soooo much better about myself. \n\n-you will reach a point where you just have to shut the fuck up and vomit on the page for extended periods of time. This phase is incredibly isolating and draining. \n\n-find a fun and healthy way to switch off! Make it a habit, force yourself even if you don't want to. I started boxing thrice weekly. Holy shit it has made a huuuuge difference to my state of mind. \n\n-remember to CELEBRATE the achievements you will achieve. Finish a chapter? Go for dinner! Get a paper published? Porn hub premium. Get good supervisor feedback? Buy a new game. You get the idea. \n\nAnyway, there's lots more I can say, but those are pretty important. Overall this has been an incredibly worthwhile experience but not without struggles. I truly have felt the lowest of lowest, wallowed in self pity and used substances to escape. On the flip side, I have learned to manage myself now and realised that I CAN DO IT. \n\nDon't sign up if you aren't ready to have your ego stripped, your cynicism (about academia) increased and your personal hygiene impacted during writing phases haha. \n\nGood luck!

Here's what I've learned: it's basically like any big project, so don't think MA/BA, think major science project in a lab. If you're gonna go empirical, like I did, plan small. It's relatively easy to collect more data, but I burned up a lot of resources setting up a giant data pool, only to realize I didn't have the time and manpower to use it all. Think realistic, think feasible. If you don't have a connection to a professor/program yet, that might be a good place to start. I did that wrong, picked a university and pestered them into accepting me LOL, which also meant they weren't always best geared to tackle my questions. Which can be fine if you can manage your own network, I guess. And that's key. You need relationships, networks, etc. Not only because of the usual reasons but also because as a PhD you're kinda out on your own. So that's what most people in my field (psycholinguistics) do, choose a professor or program and contact them directly either with a research plan (what you want to do) or expressed interest in the specific projects/topics the prof's working on. The person you choose can be important because you'll have to work with them both on a personal and a professional level. Then you need a job, probably. I was an assistant throughout most of my PhD, which involved teaching etc. duties and, in part, writing my thesis. I loved it, I love academia. But I spent way too much time and energy on being a (good) university \"lecturer\" and I started writing the actual thesis late, like 4 years into my program. Yeah. Start writing right away. Free write some drafts of your literature review as you read, start your day by jotting down your thoughts, whatever, but write a good chunk of your time every day, from the beginning. Also, publications matter, but you're better off having 2 in peer-reviewed journals (the toughest) than 5 or more elsewhere. As for how much work is involved, that depends on you. If you're really disciplined and focus on your research, it's not that long, actually. As I look at mine, I practically wrote my 500-page thesis from some loose notes in about a year, writing intensively 8 hours every day, weekends included. That's not counting the actual research, but I enjoyed that a lot - and probably overdid it, I have material to publish for years. With hindsight, I'd rather write 250 pages, or push hard for an article-based thesis. Do that, if you can, negotiate it from the beginning. Professionally speaking, that gets you much further. No one's gonna read my 500 pages except for my committee. I'll admit I'm not the most successful/orthodox PhD student, but if you have any questions, don't hesitate.

At least become comfortable so you don't have to waste time during the semester. They are valuable not only to analyze data but to also to get it.\n\n3) Sign up for a gym. Ideally go at least 3 times a week. You'll be sitting all day and your body and mind will be grateful.\n\n4) Meditate daily\n\n5) Learn how to cook and have a healthy and varied diet. No junk food. Lots of veggies. No refined sugars, syrups and the like. \n\n6) If you drink caffeinated beverages daily, do a cleanse regularly (few days or a week every 3 months). Ideally stay away from them.\n\n7) Prioritize good healthy sleep. &gt;= 7hrs\n\n8) First year, you most probably won't have a life.\n\n9) If you don't like your cohort mates still do an extra effort to socialize with them. You'll probably be spending a lot of time with them and the worst that could happen to you is to be at odds with someone that you see daily.\n\n10) Be very open with professors if you have any problem following a course. Make use of office hours!\n\n11) Before renting a room or apartment in the city, take a look at the office space they'll provide you (if they do) and the library or any other working spaces. If they are shared, ask if they'll be crowded. If so, it may be a good idea to spend an extra buck on an apartment/room that is study-friendly.\n\n12) Buy a reliable and light laptop. A Mac or a Thinkpad /XPS with linux.\n\n13) Try to drink only once a week. Besides the obvious health issues, it drains a lot of energy. from you and decreases your productivity even on the following day. Forget about weed.\n\n14) Try to preview and review the material for each class.\n\n15) Try to define a research topic ASAP so you can relate all the course papers to it. And also to start talking about it to potential advisors and colleges.\n\n16) Subscribe to relevant journals. I use Researcher App.\n\n17) Improve your writing skills.\n\n18) Work on your speech skills too. Take each presentation for class as a great opportunity to improve them. Record yourself. Watch and improve.\n\nThat's all I can think of.

If you read daily, I guarantee you will be light-years ahead of the students in your program who don't. For reading, go to the primary literature before textbooks.\n\nReading primary literature is difficult at first, but the more you read, the better and faster you will get at it. It will also make you a better writer, because you will recognize good and bad writing practices (i.e. stuff you like and stuff you hate, respectively).\n\nI also recommend you come up with a system for keeping papers (PDFs) and notes on them - something easily searchable. This will help you when you remember something vague from a paper you read years ago but it's not enough to find the paper on the internet. Example: I was trying to find a statistics paper that had the word \"boolean\" in the title, but I was mis-remembering it as \"binary\", because they mean the same thing in the paper's context. However, since the authors never use the term \"binary\" in the title or the paper, it took me hours to re-find the paper.\n\nCitation managers work really well for the above because then you can use them to directly cite the paper later when you're writing. When you import into a citation manager, make sure to correct formatting issues, because it's easier to correct those one at a time than 100+ at a time when you're submitting a paper. Zotero is a nice, cross-platform citation manager that has a built-in way to add \"Notes\" to papers.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/chll08/starting_my_phd_soon_any_advice/euw1ns6/"}, "1595": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CaptainOuzo", "Date": 1564071846, "Score": 4, "Body": "Since you're in Arts, I'm not entirely sure where my experience applies and where it doesn't. I'm studying in Canada, which may have a different academic system than your the EU system.\n\nIn any case, I like to compare doing a Ph.D. to a regular full time job. I worked as a web developer for five years before starting my career as a scientist, and I've found a lot of parallels. A notable difference is that as a Ph.D. student I've been expected to do a lot of stuff outside my immediate research. Teaching, outreach, favors. I also work in a shared office with people who, like myself, like to talk and procrastinate. Consequently, there are more distractions, and it can be difficult to find uninterrupted time to get big tasks done. Which is why it's been important for me to split big tasks into small ones that I can slot into 30 minute periods.\n\nTreat it like a 9-5 job. Or 8-4. Or 10-6. The key thing is set hours for yourself when you're in \"work\" mode, and hours when you aren't. It's not always easy, but try not to bring your Ph.D. worries home with you. On days where I've had nagging problems that I knew would keep me awake all night, I just stayed at the office until I either solved them, or had made a solid strategy for tackling the issue the next day.\n\nI try not to ever work from home. For a start, there are too many distractions (Netflix, video games...), but I also want my home to be a place to relax and unwind and nothing else.\n\nYes, I procrastinate (I'm doing so right now!), and I don't always stick to my schedule, but I'm 3 years in to my Ph.D., on-track with where I'd planned to be by now, and don't feel like I'm frustrated or burning out.\n\nI almost never work on weekends. I am involved in a lot of side projects, though, and sometimes I need to put an hour or two in on a weekend to catch up with those. But so far I've taken most weekends (and stat holidays) completely off, to just watch shows, play games, or go outside and wander the park trails.\n\nI did some work in Europe in which I broke all these rules. Worked very long days. Worked a lot of weekends. And it was amazing because I was in a new place, and every day had interesting experiences. I rode a bike for the first time in 15 years and used it to get to and from my field sites. And all my field experiments worked. It was amazing. When you find yourself in these situations, just go with the flow. It's OK to break your rules sometimes.\n\nAnd yeah, find a hobby or two. Or three. And it's OK if they are tangentially related to your work (my microphotography hobby is very useful in my field) as long as you can still use them to temporarily set aside your professional obligations.\n\nOne mistake I made - I didn't get all my M.Sc. stuff out of the way (writing of journal articles) before i started my Ph.D. Now I am writing a journal article based on my M.Sc. at the same time as trying to deal with field experiments and writing of Ph.D. chapters.

I think this comes down to department culture. In my university, Latex is more popular in math-heavy departments. Perhaps because it's less annoying than having to fiddle around with Microsoft's equation editor. Almost nobody in my department (Biology) uses it, and I know faculty who actively advise their students against it.\n\n2) R and Python are amazing and you'll appreciate knowing both. Even if your program/supervisor(s)/coworkers don't use Python, learn it anyway. It is a very powerful and easy programming language to learn.\n\n6) Coffee is the lifeblood of grad school, and depending on what you mean by \"cleanse\" you may be venturing firmly into the land of pseudoscience. I will agree that it sucks to have a chemical dependence. I certainly do, and it means that whenever I visit my family (who only drink decaf) I end up with pretty annoying caffeine withdrawal symptoms. I stopped cold turkey for two months as a self-experiment, but it didn't make any noticeable improvement to my energy levels or quality of sleep. Ideally it is best used on occasion for when you really need the stimulant effects... but we all know that's not how it usually goes down. It becomes a vice. And as far as vices go, it's relatively cheap and harmless.\n\n12) Don't sacrifice quality for slim/lightweight when it comes to laptops. I am most productive on a reasonably large gaming laptop. The screen is large and makes multi-tasking easier. The keyboard is full size with a number pad which makes writing easier. It's high performance and can run permutation analyses in a fraction of the time of any other laptop I've used. Gaming laptops also give you a hobby to take your mind off things. And with the right games, it can be far from a mindless thing.\n\n13) I'm in Canada so weed is commonplace. My take on this, as well as drinking, is that moderation is better advice than abstinence because people WILL use this stuff. Alcohol is far worse than weed - it can ruin and end lives. Yet still, in moderation, it is fine.\n\n17) Agreed!

Most programs view their coursework as integral to the program, as a way of ensuring all students are at the same level and have the same skills going into the dissertation. I've heard rumours of some programs that will allow students to skip coursework if they already have a masters - but only here on reddit, never in real life. Very likely, this will be entirely up to the programs you look at as it will be at their discretion. \n\nWhether or not you can work full time will, again, depend on the program. Part-time PhDs aren't terribly common, but they certainly aren't uncommon - especially for professionals working in the industry. But, I know of programs that will not allow part-time status or allow students (whether part-time or full-time) to work outside the program. You might not have been able to find anything that suits because the programs in your area of interest have such a high time-commitment they don't offer it as a part-time option.\n\nI will say though, that a PhD is a substantial amount of work. Most advice is to treat it like a 9-5 job - but that's said as a method for keeping mentally well, as many students feel pressured to work around the clock, far more than 40 hours a week. Just be aware that even part-time PhDs are quite a substantial commitment, and you should be prepared to add 20 hours of work a week to your current schedule - and assuming a part-time PhD will take you double the time of the average PhD, you are looking at maintaining that for likely more than a decade. (Most PhDs, as far as I'm aware, take between 5-7 years full-time.) \n\nSo, I suppose, in short: whether or not you can do a PhD part-time will be both dependent on the programs you apply to - and whether or not they allow it, but also on yourself. You might find the commitment to be greater than the reward, considering the required amount of work. Finding programs you like and contacting them about part-time options is likely your best bet at the moment, and really talk to them about expectations and time commitments of PhD candidates and how much work they anticipate you'll be doing on a weekly basis.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cin522/can_i_complete_a_phd_part_time_while_keeping_a/ev7r5yr/"}, "1692": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bannanabel", "Date": 1564268911, "Score": 1, "Body": "I loved my first year and a half till I hit the second year blues.

My position is also funded, I get $500 AUD per week. My partner is doing the same.

We're fine with bills like electricity, phones, etc., and we can afford to eat well. So if you moved into a share house or a cheap apartment, then you'd probably find the same thing. \n\nThat being said, it doesn't cover much more than living expenses, and if I could've lived at home for longer than I would have. I work \\~12 hours a week in a teaching position during the semester, which allows me to put a little into savings and have something resembling a social life, but if I had stayed at home then it would have nearly all been straight into savings, which is better for long term financial stability.\n\nWhether you need to regularly be on campus also depends on your particular PhD program. Mine focuses on deep learning for healthcare, and most of that work can be done from home using my personal computer. So I don't need to go into campus often - I usually only go in for teaching. If you have lab work that you need to be doing, obviously that's not an option.

It varies hugely based on the consortium and the EU officer how communication and organization are carried out, so be a bit patient at the beginning, everybody is in the same boat. Once the administrative issues settle, the network is pretty awesome. We had a couple of courses and a midterm meeting so far and I really like the small cohort of PhD students and that most of the courses are organized to fit our interconnected but still interdisciplinary projects. Also since there are multiple industrial partners, it is great to gain experience in both industry and academia (of course this also depends on the participating partners in the ITN) through the secondments. Unfortunately, one issue was that most of the students had little knowledge about the exact details of the program (salary, requirements, etc..) when they started and it caused some misunderstandings, but if you are aware of your contract and what is expected of you it's not that complex. If you already got it (you should have), go through the 'Annex' which is the general agreement between all parties in the ITN and you will find tons of useful information in there.\n\nTime and project management is especially important, since the funding is limited (3years) and you also have to comply with your local university's PhD requirements, while travelling significantly more than a 'local' PhD student (courses, meetings, secondments).  Based on your university's requirements and the courses offered in the ITN, you might need to take extra courses, which can be a bit hard to squeeze in in the 2nd and 3rd year.

They have been there before, they know how it is, they can provide more specific recommendations. \n\nYou start thinking about research topics asap, and never stops. Keep notes about your ideas all the time. This will allow your ideas to develop over time. \n\nDifferent advisors have different ways and styles to do things. Some work very closely, some are very distant. Some are very helpful, some are not. But, even if they are close and helpful, remember that you are being trained to be an independent researcher, and you are expected to eventually know more about your topic than anyone else (including your advisor).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cjv5un/starting_graduate_school_in_the_next_few_weeks/evgh1ig/"}, "1834": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Wednesday_words", "Date": 1564514042, "Score": 4, "Body": "You guys really have to pay just to fucking *apply*?
