The lowest quartile has probably only been in the job for a couple years at most, suggesting that they did something else (low-paid postdoc, or industry work?) for 4-6 years.

The goal is to cluster papers on the same subtopic.\n* If this subtopic will not help your research, make 3-4 notes of the contents of this paper, then set it in the \"not very relevant\" pile and move on.\n* If this topic will help your research, then read the Introduction and confirm the claimed findings in the paper's methodology section.  Write a 2-4 sentence summary in your own words, of the paper's research problem, approach, and scientific contributions.  This summary will serve two purposes: 1. To remind you what the paper is about, and 2. You can copy it almost verbatim into a \"Related Work\" section of your own paper.  Skim the rest of the paper for trustworthiness red flags, like bad formatting, lack of methodology description, lack of references, too little explanation of formulae, nonsensical real-world application, etc.\n* If you have any questions while reading the paper, make note of them.  Even if you can't find the answer now, having the question written down will remind you later that this part of the paper was never clear and you didn't just forget it.\n* After you've read the pile, draw yourself a diagram (shapes and arrows) of all the subtopics you found and how they relate and feed in to each other.

I tend to be a pretty positive and happy person in general. I have not always been that way and I still have my bad days. In general I'd say that the biggest contributing factor is that I make an effort to see the positive side of things. I make it a huge priority in my life to **get enough sleep** (when I get over tired I get super depressed and jaded and negative and unproductive, it is awful and directly tied to sleep. When I'm well rested, I feel like I can take on the world). Additionally, music is a big mood changer for me so I have several playlists to put me in a particular mood. I choose **happy and upbeat songs** that just make me want to get up and move. I would also suggest finding out **when and how you work best**. Who gives a shit if you work 100 hours a week or 20, as long as you get your work done. A lot of times the people who tell me they work 70/80 hours a week are the same people who get super distracted at work or they don't plan their experiments well so that incubation periods overlap with something else. They spend the majority of time socializing, on reddit, eating, really anything but work so it takes them twice as long to get anything done. I also recommend if you don't have one already, **get a hobby you enjoy**. Something that relaxes you, I like to knit. Here is the \"easier said than done\" part that I am still working on myself. **Go out and meet new friends that aren't in your program**. Join a volunteer club or take a painting class, boxing class, really just do anything you enjoy where you can meet and engage other people. Lastly, I think it is important to **celebrate the little things** and see the beauty in the every day things in life. Oh, your PCR worked? Score! It is snowing outside? Look how pretty it is! Also, be excited to see other people and eventually they will be excited to see you too. \n\nHope some of this helps, these are the things I do to keep my sanity.

Talk with advisors. I left a PhD program, but before I did, I totally hit the wall just like you describe. I was blunt, and told a professor honestly how exhausted I was. This professor was a PhD research slave driver, and I expected him to declare me a failure. Instead he was surprisingly empathetic and accommodating. He shared with me a deeply personal story about a time in his grad school career when he burned out and almost lost his then girlfriend, now wife. When I told a different professor who I was TA-ing for, I felt like she took me under her wing and shielded me from any unnecessary work. I feared that telling her would make her look down on me or doubt me. In reality, sharing that with her somehow forged a relationship that led us to be oddly loyal to each other. You're clearly juggling a lot and working hard. If you're sincere, I imagine people will recognize your effort and cut you some slack--perhaps work with you on the scheduling of those prelims.

Even if you think you don't have time, I think (1) and (2) might help you recharge, enable better productivity when you do work, and feel less of a wall. 1) maintain a non-PhD related hobby that isn't reading or looking at a screen in which you can zone out and experience \"flow\" 2) leave the electronics at home and go for a long walk--preferably in secluded nature or with a non-grad-student-friend. 3) it seemed to me PhD students are struck with debilitating self-doubt and an impostor syndrome.

Yes, it is not a nice thing to do to the school to turn them down after you've already accepted. But you can't select the course of the next five years based on that reason. \n\nI am a 2nd year phd student. I initially accepted a position at one school, but the next day I got an offer from a school with a professor who I REALLY wanted to work with. I turned down the first school. I had even paid the deposit at that time. I felt bad and it wasn't easy, but it had to be done. I'm happy with my decision. ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_3wyfmq.json"}}
