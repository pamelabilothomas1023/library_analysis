Also, my previous PI gave a talk at my current university and apparently bragged about how good I was and they remembered that which certainly helped.\n\nMy only advice for emailing professors is to ask them interesting questions and hope they reply. Unfortunately, many of them are too busy. If possible, go to conferences and introduce yourself in person.\n\nI can't say for other programs, but my current program is a mid tier R1 university and my undergraduate research experience is greater than the majority of the other PhD students here. Will you take your grant with you into graduate school? Will you use it to cover your tuition? If so, universities find this very appealing. If not, it still looks good as a prior accomplishment but they may be concerned that you will be distracted working on a prior project that's unrelated to your new advisor's work. It's definitely a plus no matter what but it's significance really depends on your potential advisor.\n\nWhat I mean about a PhD program being stressful and humbling is that it's an intense amount of work where your expected to function at the highest level 100% of the time. So far you have likely been praised and compared to other undergraduates where you clearly stand out as being exceptional. This completely changes in a PhD program. Here you will almost certainly struggle with imposter syndrome as experts regularly criticize your work and tell you it's not good enough. Expect situations where you pull all nighters and work throughout the weekend on a manuscript only to be told you made a foundational mistake and have to start from scratch. It will truly check your ego if you have one and will humble you. As far as writing your SoP, you might want to give the impression that you are resilient to burnout, dedicated to success despite unexpected hurdles, and that you take criticism well. Don't say these things directly but show them through past experiences. Don't show any hint of weakness or uncertainty in your statement.\n\nYou really need a thick skin and must be willing to make personal sacrifices to succeed. I personally know a lot of extremely intelligent PhD students who couldn't handle it and quit. However, despite all this, I truly love it here. I never felt I fit in anywhere in my life until I got here. I'm surrounded by other nerds like me who will happily debate philosophy, love talking about science, and show a deep interest in the same obscure shit that I do.

During the time you are meant to write you may do three things: 1. write; 2. do NOTHING; 3. write out all the thoughts you get around writing the paper.\n3. Nothing means NOTHING.

Your thoughts are frightening and huge, but as real as they are, they are just thoughts. You've already identified a key reason why you're not writing: if you don't, you don't have to experience a painful feeling from rejection. We think rejection is huge, we take it very personally.

This makes me think they don't exist. And of course, they do. You earned your place there. The only thing you'll regret is giving up. Maybe spend some time thinking about how you are different from others in a way that doesn't require judgement, \"I am slower than them.\" You are different, and there must be a valuable reason why that is going to be lost if you focus on them, and not you. Set goals for yourself that are about you, and not living up to them. And on those basic mistakes, I have thought about that a lot but honestly, in the past 6 months I have copy edited two volumes my advisor is working on with various authors, and so many of them are seasoned PhDs, and they can't write to save their lives. They are really awful, and often do shotty research. Ultimately, these kinds of things do not dictate what kind of scholars and scientists we are going to be.

This year, as my husband has changed his job and moved to Brussels (which is a 2h train ride away but still kind of long with all the city traveling), I go on camus maybe once or twice a month and I wouldn't say it's the best of the experiences being away from school: you don't see many people that can relate to what's going on or to start research projects with, it gets lonely, your work schedule gets disrupted, etc.\n\nFurthermore, as a student in Europe you need to have a long-term visa/a residence permit, so you'd have to have at least a nominal place to stay/be registered to, which costs money anyway.\n\nAnother consideration is where you want to go once you're done with the PhD. If it's back home, that might work, but otherwise it's not really helpful for growing your network - e.g., my school won't fund visits originating other than from France.\n\nOverall, in your case, I'd think a kind of a solution would be to go on a research stay - a colleague of mine, who is from Canada, has spent three years in France, and is now on a one-year visit in Montreal.

The scholarship I'm getting is from the school foundation and it's basically a salary paid in several installments over the year, but for whatever (I guess tax) reasons, it's considered a non-professional non-work revenue but I (nor any of my colleagues) don't have an employment contract from the school. \n\nFinally, if this helps, a student visa allows some employment but not full time, so whenever I do grading or research assistance, I sign a new contract for that particular activity.

I'll give you my perspective, just as an FYI I do not suffer from MH issues and am very extroverted. \n\nYes, doing a PhD is difficult. It's especially difficult at the beginning. You are moving into an environment where you are solely surrounded by the most brilliant minds. Whereas in your circle of friends, you may be the most informed about your subject and may have to simplify things to help others understand, you will now be in an environment where everyone knows what you are talking about and then some. Essentially, it's easy to feel intimidated.\n\nBeyond this, the expectations are high -- you need to deliver quality work and though some departments are less competitive than others, you will always hear about your colleagues publishing, going to conferences, finding their committee before you do. It can be exhausting to compare yourself to others. \n\nFinally, if you let it... PhD work can easily -- and I mean \\*very\\* easily -- bleed into the rest of your life. You'll be inclined to work into the night. And you'll feel \\*awful\\* on those unproductive days when you haven't done a thing.\n\nTHAT HAVING BEEN SAID...\n\nYou can make it manageable. You can make it a great experience. Treat it like a 9-5 job. Leave your work at the office every day -- those days where you work into the night should be VERY rare. Be kind to yourself. Understand that everyone's journey is different. For example, I'm developing my dissertation proposal now (third year) while some colleagues had it coming in. I struggled so much with quantitative methods (and still do!) while some of my colleagues are already publishing papers using advanced models. I try to be kind with myself. I remind myself of those awesome things I bring to the department. For example, I'm very proud of my work as a TA! I get kickass student evaluations and always feel so happy when one of my students tells me I sparked an interest for them in the field. That's really cool.\n\nLast thing. Remember that you are steeped in an environment with brilliant minds and it can make you feel like you're behind. But those people are a tiny percentage of the population. Don't only compare yourself to them! It's easy to get lost in it and forget that there's a whole other world out there with people interested in other things, working other jobs, with different priorities... and who look at you like you're freaking Einstein! I'm still friends with my high school buddies. While I am kicking myself for saying something stupid or irrelevant in a seminar, convinced my colleagues must think I am stupid, I hang out with my high school friends and they are just blown away by my Master's thesis: \"How did you do that ?!\". It's easy to lose perspective in a PhD.\n\nMy suggestion is -- give it a shot! Try it out. If it isn't for you... don't be afraid to leave. It's so fucking brave to leave a PhD when you can rationally say, \"hey, I tried, not for me!\". You can get a cool research job with your MA, and those employers would be lucky to have someone so passionate. \n\nFeel free to DM me or reply to the thread if you have any more questions...

I have CPTSD and at times the anxiety/depression keeps me out of class and causes other problems. I am currently in the 2nd year of my doctoral study. Last year was a huge learning experience. I worked with my therapist to make sure I was giving myself space, doing as much as I could to stay organized and keeping a toolkit of useful strategies. Most of all though, knowing when enough is enough to stepping back to take care of myself. Your doctoral work will require having health partners like a therapist, but also check in with your dean of students or whoever is in charge of student welfare and have to confidential talk about your concerns. When I did this last year, when my issues were causing me so much stress that I almost quit, I found out that my CPTSD is considered a \"psychiatric disability\" under the ADA, just as some other mental illnesses are. That means that I have the legal right to have support for my needs, and accommodation for things that are so triggering that they disrupt the learning process. For example, timed, in-class exams are so difficult for me that I worked with the Dean and my advisor, who also needs to be on that team, to do at-home exams when needed. But the biggest rules of mental health in this stressful kind of setting are: 1. Give yourself space. Self care has to be your #1 priority at all times, not just when things are slow. 2. Stay organized. This helps create structure and stability, which helps to lessen the stress of the program overall. Begin working on papers early, never procrastinate, and plan in advance when possible. 3. Someone else's emergency isn't your emergency. Even your advisor. Do not soak up other peoples chaos and stress. 4. Find the best ways to appropriately make your needs known. This was really hard for me last year because it includes knowing your limits and setting boundaries. My advisor is chaos incarnate, and that triggers me really badly. I had to find an appropriate way to be honest with her and find a way to work with her. \n\nGet good sleep, eat well, spend time in nature, and make these things necessary. The best advice my therapist gave me was that taking care of myself can never be something I do when I have time. It always has to be the #1 priority. If the culture of the space you are going to be in doesn't support that, then there are internal problems and it may simply not be the right program for you. Academia is full of ridiculous ego-pushing, but you don't have to buy into that or make it your problem.\n\nFor networking and stuff, I also find this really hard. Our annual conference (AAR) is thousands of people, and way too overwhelming for me to stay in for the duration. What I do is highlight only those opportunities that are most meaningful to me, like 1-2 network events where I give myself a roughly 1 hour limit to being there, unless I am feeling great. The rest of the time is spent taking care of myself, going to only those panels that are most useful, and having 1-1 meetings. Last year I tried to do it \"the normal way\" and I burned out on day 2. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with starting slow and working your way forward, exploring what works for you and what doesn't. We've never been here before, but there is absolutely nothing about having a mental illness that should prevent you from following your dreams. Just focus on fulfilling YOU, and absolutely most of all, not breaking yourself to make other people happy, even your advisor. This is just part of your own journey. it doesn't define you. Get that conversation started, work with a good therapist or support group, and keep your eye on your personal mission and just remember, if you aren't feeling well, that is OK. It doesn't mean you failed or will fail. It just means its time for a refocus on self-care. People with mental illnesses can do anything. We just tend to do it with greater sensitivity, and honestly the world (especially academia) needs more of that. And keep reaching out.

I myself have a cocktail of mental health issues - I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in the middle of my master's program, actually. The phrase \"[impostor syndrome](https://chroniclevitae.com/news/412-faking-it-women-academia-and-impostor-syndrome)\" was essentially coined to describe a [collection of depressive symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) in high-achieving people (like academia) without actually calling it depression. \n\nAs to why it happens, who knows. I, personally, had mental health concerns before going into graduate school and graduate school exacerbated them. I'm sure it could happen the other way around (mentally healthy people go into grad school and come out with some issues). Doctoral programs are sometimes (probably more often than not) high-stress environments: (needlessly) competitive classmates, the occasional abusive professor who has a lot of control over you, the fact that it's an environment that usually RELIES ON and REWARDS both self-critique and outside critique (academic peer review, student evaluations of you when you teach, annual professor evaluations of you as a student, etc.), and so on. \n\n&gt;I don't know if I'm too emotionally fragile for academia basically, and if my MH problems become exacerbated under stress and pressure, is doing a PhD really a wise thing for me to do?\n\nSo, I am very close to the finish line now - I'm on the (academic) job market and I'm nearing the end of my dissertation. Watching the incoming Ph.D. students and the things they worry about definitely has me reflecting on my own experiences. I will say that I think graduate students often \"psych themselves out\" about things that really aren't that big of a deal (and I include myself in that). For instance, most of us were straight-A students, easily, so to get a B or B+ on an assignment in an unusually difficult class can sometimes send one student into full-blown panic, and then the others who maybe were already a little concerned about it for one reason or another sort of feed off of that negativity. I would say grad school is 10% being \"smart,\" 20% \"doing the work\" and 70% emotional regulation - at the end of the day, grades don't matter as long as they're high enough to stay in the program, and none of that evaluation that gets done on you matters as long as you learn from it and you are always working and improving.\n\nAs for your actual question, that's a decision that only you can make. It IS a tough road, you won't make much money, you will uproot your life for the next 3-5 years - you'll put off relationships, you won't have a lot of free time, and you may just come out of it with more mental health issues than you had to begin with (lol). But it is also incredibly rewarding and the work is intellectually stimulating enough to make me feel fulfilled at the end of the day. Looking back at all the choices I've made, I think I would still do a Ph.D. despite also being emotionally fragile because I have wanted it so badly for a very long time. I think the only thing I would do differently, and the thing that I would advise ANYONE thinking about going to grad school (fragile or not), is to make finding a therapist early in your graduate school career a #1 priority. This is the same advice I would give someone going into any other physically or mentally \"risky\" situation - if I knew you were going to be going into construction, I would tell you that getting a tetanus shot and making sure you take care of your body (eating right, stretching, investing in a foam roller) are a #1 priority.

I want to add couple of things that I wish people told me before the phd. \nI finished mine recently, uk, humanities, full scholarship and living expenses, some teaching experience, currently seeking a lectureship. I had depression in highschool and I felt it came back couple of times during PhD.\n\n1-Your supervisor can heavily affect this whole experience. Mine was super famous but bragged about not giving any pastoral care. He was super hard on me when we first met, especially because I did my masters elsewhere and was not their student from before. I had to change my topic quite a bit and there were times I thought about switching supervisors and was afraid other academics wouldnt accept me. It all got better after 3rd year when i successfully organised a big conference, turns out he was being hard on me on purpose and that conference really impressed him. I wish I knew that I could also rely on my other supervisor more earlier on. So, if you can, find other supportive people and do your research about your future supervisor. If they choose to show tough love, repeat yourself this is not necessarily your fault and think of ways to change dynamics.\n\n2- Don't compare yourself with others. I was one of the youngest and felt pretty bad about my own accomplishments compared to older students or super genius robotic people. Your entire cohort will be quite bright but prepare yourself for meeting really exceptional, disciplined people. Thats why we all have imposter syndromes.\n\n3- Have friends outside PhD. Sure, working alone might seem great at first and the following isolation and loneliness will push you to go to shared spaces and hang out with other PhDs. But it also means you will hear bad, competitive gossip. Sometimes you cannot avoid it, especially if teaching roles are scarce and you are all competing in reality. Some people will be really bitchy and will try to pull you into drama. Avoid it if you can, never comment negativity on your supervisor or other profs, observe but stay out and then vent to your real life friends outside the PhD.\n\n4- Don't compare yourself with others (part 2). Sometimes the rules will change mid-phd. Like progression was easier in the year before me, it got harder when I started. Secondly, I had to wait forever for people before me to graduate to get that part time teaching role - while people from 2 years after me had easier time finding teaching roles even in their first year. Your whole experience will be totally different from others so don't beat yourself up.\n\n5-Networking and teaching takes time and its just more effort for introverted people. I still suck at approaching big names at conferences and I over prepare for my conference presentations and lectures. Discover methods to make yourself comfortable about your content, for me I make notes (15 pages for 2 hour lecture and I've been teaching different topics so i must have 200-300 pages of bulletpoint talking points). \n\n6- at the end of the day, it was not the research that got me depressed. It was the harsh criticism, internal politics, competitive fellow students and lack of support. No one can guarantee you how your environment will be before you start but keep in mind that change is always possible if things suck. You can take an interruption, change supervisors, change your work hours and location, apply for research abroad, collaborate with new people, change your career goals, teach different topics, publish different papers. You just need to be really really flexible and stubborn at the same time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dsyn4a/doing_a_phd_with_mental_illness/f6up4sh/"}, "352": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "taqwalawaal", "Date": 1573166587, "Score": 2, "Body": "Send me an invite link", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dt4fru/phd_chatroom/f6uqjl9/"}, "353": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TheCockatoo", "Date": 1573166789, "Score": 1, "Body": "Nice!

I cried through the meeting I had with my supervisors yesterday because they want to see writing and I want to know how I pay rent for the next 3 months.

Generally, I got the impression that doing a PhD in Europe is less stressful than in the US (due to different funding situation, mostly no loans and the opportunity to have your project treated like a job, i.e. getting a salary, having paid time off etc.).\n\nI'm only half a year into my PhD, but what helped me so far is:  \n1) Choose a supervisor that has a healthy approach to work/life-balance. Mine never answered emails at night/on weekends in my application phase, which was a \"green flag\" for me - people who take care to have enough breaks, have time for family, social life, refueling their energy resources through whatever means will mostly be more likely to support those traits in others, too.\n\n2) Don't fall intro the trap of overwork culture. Sure, there will be times with working hour peaks, e.g. before conferences or project milestones, or if you have to collect your data in a certain time frame. But don't let the people who never leave work early become the standard - you can't work 12-hour days productively over an extended period of time, so take breaks, treat your PhD as the job it is and try keeping it to a 9-5 schedule (or whatever works for you, just in terms of how much hours to put into work).\n\n3) Have a life outside the PhD. Friends on campus are great, but the ones that force you to go home and take time off are invaluable too. Make time for exercise, healthy food and doing whatever keeps you happy (if that's having a break from people and being for yourself, that's fine too, just find out what you need to do to stay in a good place mentally).\n\n4) Enjoy the experience! You'll have several years dedicated to research, reading, writing, learning and expanding your mind in general, which is pretty cool. :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dsyn4a/doing_a_phd_with_mental_illness/f6vszrf/"}, "376": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Jagable", "Date": 1573200516, "Score": 5, "Body": "it would open people up to revealing their identity, possibly providing a link between their reddit and facebook account, and not everyone even uses facebook", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dt4fru/phd_chatroom/f6vtyoq/"}, "377": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Dalall2015", "Date": 1573206213, "Score": 1, "Body": "Agreed", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dt4fru/phd_chatroom/f6vxko1/"}, "378": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LinguistWannabe", "Date": 1573207403, "Score": 2, "Body": "yeah, only less for work", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dt4fru/phd_chatroom/f6vyaui/"}, "379": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LinguistWannabe", "Date": 1573207481, "Score": 1, "Body": "there are two already in this thread.

So, regarding things like loneliness and cultural adjustements, I really moved expecting things to be tough.\n\nLoneliness has been part of my experience. However, I think I was mentally prepared for that. And things were indeed much harder in the beginning.\n\nI'm now in my 3rd year, and I believe over time it's a choice you need to make. You don't need to be lonely, but you need to make plans and take action about that. Otherwise, a PhD can push everything away, including your social life.\n\n\"Overwhelmed\" was one of the words I used the most in my first year. Now, every year, when we get new students, I have a meeting with them to talk about what to expect in the first year. Feeling overwhelmed, guilty, incapable. I can't really prevent all of that, but at least I can tell that's normal, and they have someone to talk with when they are struggling. I joke a little saying that at least they will not have to deal with hurricane Harvey (I live in Houston, and the hurricane happened just a few weeks after I arrived here).\n\nAt least in my experience, coursework will sometimes give more than we can handle. I also had to focus on my coursework during my first year, with almost no research. Of course, we want to do our research. But if it's already so overwhelming with only coursework, you can imagine how things would be with both coursework and research going on at full force (my second year). Take it as an opportunity to get adjusted, if you don't have much research yet.\n\nAgain, a PhD will often test your limits. You will be given more than you can handle, and then your advisor and yourself will be better able to understand what you can handle, and what you can't. What are your strengths and your weaknesses. If you have a great advisor like I do, your advisor will take all of that into account to plan accordingly. Guide you in ways to overcome some weaknesses. Guide you to avoid research tasks that  are not really for you.\n\nI think now in my third year I have a much better grasp at what I'm capable of, what I can still be capable of if I study and prepare properly, and what is really beyond my capabilities. And that has a tremendous help. Sometimes we think we are incapable of everything, because everything we do seems wrong, or not good enough.\n\nIt is hard, for example, to put so much effort into something, and then be told it was a master's level work, not PhD's level. But, at least here, I feel like it's like tough love. They don't do that to make me feel incompetent, or depressed. They do that because they believe I can do better (and I can), but they need to make me see that (and gradually I see more and more).\n\nSo, it's overwhelming in many ways. But also, because of that, you can improve by leaps. When I look back at everything that has happened with me in a little more than 2 years, it's really amazing. I grew in so many ways.\n\nStay strong. Take care of your health, that's really important. It's a tough and long journey.

That said, there are plenty of fellowships that will happily pay for someone like you to get a doctorate.  \n\n2.\t I can\u2019t answer this as it\u2019s super personal.

But, from my perspective, if one wants to really do a PhD, then something like a part-time online PhD shouldn't even be even considered an alternative.\n\nA PhD is much more like a job. Even if you have coursework, it has very little relevance. You do a PhD if you want to learn how to do research. But you don't learn that by taking courses, you do while working for the university (and you should get paid for that since it's hard work). \n\nMuch of my learning is based on sitting down with professors to work on my own research, or how can I help with their own research. Getting together to go through the dataset together, discuss the literature I found together, going through each line of code together, etc. Sometimes even having lunch/dinner together, going out together, traveling together, etc. \n\nI don't feel like a student, I'm not treated as a student. At the very least, this is not a typical professor-student relationship. I'm an employee, with tasks, responsibilities, and results to deliver. Nobody really cares about your grades. Your advisor is more like your boss, not someone who is there to teach you. Your advisor should know you deeply. And the closer you are to your advisor, the more you can learn from him.\n\nBeing very close means you can have an insider perspective of how things work. You can see the subtleties in the way different people work. The different styles of each professor, not in a classroom, but in a research environment. \n\nSo, to really reap the benefits, I think you should be really close, not online. You should also be very committed to it, as a good PhD will usually leave little room for anything else. I learned a lot so far, I improved a lot so far. And I don't think I would be able to do the same with an online part-time PhD.\n\nIf it's worth or not, it's hard to say. For me, it certainly is.

Most of my work was just your standard dichloromethane, hexanes, and other solvents so I continued to do my same work in the lab before/after I was pregnant. All my work was done in a fume hood and I made sure to be extra careful and wear the correct PPE at all times. I also took an active interest in the rest of my labmates and making sure that they were all being safe as well, which helped me feel better. In general, lab safety guidelines are written assuming that pregnant women may be working in the lab, since women can obviously become accidentally pregnant and not even know for a while.\n\nJust how toxic is the thing you're working with, and at what concentrations?  This is an important question. Lots of things are teratogens, but some are more acutely toxic than others. I actually did work with a lot of teratogens in my research, but they were diluted down to ambient concentrations so I didn't expect any additional hazard from working with them. It may also be OK to work with it during TTC, as long as you are taking pregnancy tests frequently and stop using it after you become pregnant. Depending on your university, the best way to get help figuring this out would probably be to go confidentially to your EH&amp;S department. They should be able to tell you the risks for that compound and recommendations for women who are pregnant or TTC who might be around it. Also if you want to reply or PM me the name of the compound I can maybe help look up some info on it.\n\nIf it's toxic enough that you really can't work with it even while TTC, then the best option is to talk with your advisor. If you fear they will be discriminatory/mean about it, then that's a very big reason to consider *not* TTC in grad school.\n\nI would recommend telling your advisor your reasoning in general terms (i.e. \"my husband/SO and I are starting to think about kids and I'm not comfortable working with teratogens for any longer than needed\"). You don't need to (and probably shouldn't) specifically outline your whole TTC timeline. You have a right to have a life outside grad school, and your advisor only needs to know as much as affects his/her research. It sounds like you can finish this project up soon, so I don't see why your advisor needs to drag it out if you are capable of finishing it now.\n\nYou can also come armed with a detailed research timeline emphasizing phasing out teratogens and a plan if they start questioning what you would do if/when you got pregnant, such as another student (grad or undergrad) who could help you by working with the teratogen, plans to table the experiment for a while until the baby is born, or plans for alternate reagents/experiments that you can use/do instead of this one.

You may also be a lot better at this than I was since you're not a first time mom. You know the kind of work that is involved in taking care of a baby, and can plan accordingly. It sounds like you are going in to your degree with a very concrete plan on when/how to finish, so that helps immensely as well. You're motivated, and have the benefit of more perspective and experience than some of your younger peers. It also sounds like your program is fairly supportive, which is huge. \n\nI don't know how much advice you are looking for, but if you decide to go straight into your PhD program here are a few things that I wish I had done earlier in my PhD that would have helped mitigate the stress:\n\n1. Get a therapist if you don't already have one. \n2. Get a mentor who is not your advisor.\n3. Know where to get help. Help with schoolwork, help with writing/reading/revising, help with housework, help with childcare... \n4. Make sure household chores are split evenly if they are not already.\n5. (the most important) Make sure your motivation is rock solid, and defend your choice. Getting a PhD is not mandatory, which leads to some awkward blame-shaming when you run into difficulties. This is in my experience a feminist issue since men don't get nearly the degree of \"I told you so\" when they have kids and struggle in academia. When you're stressed and looking for help, there might be some jerks who tell you that you brought this on yourself and don't have any right to complain. Don't let people like that bring you down, or stop you from getting help. Just because you choose to do something difficult doesn't mean you deserve to be neglected or forced to quit. \n\nI think the last point can be especially tough for those of us with families, as our family members feel the effects of the PhD and can sometimes blame us for inflicting the extra stress on them. There may be cases where you truly do need to step back and consider the strain on your family, but make sure you are prepared to tell what is truly an unfair stress and when it is time for your family/spouse to back you up and be supportive. There have been both types of situations in my experience so far, and it can be hard to know which is which. \n\nSorry for the long post. I hope it's not too wordy.

Your family needs to be ready for that.\n\nAnd, if you don't stay in Canada and decide to move to the US to do a PhD, then you probably will not be able to work.

It is still not a good area for my niche line of work though.\n\nBut you know what? I have been the happiest here.  The last few months have been amazing. I found a solid therapist and talked through my resentment, my anger, sadness. Found out how i could make ME happy while dealing with situations like now. Because i matter just as much as his education and career. And most importantly i learned how to express this to him better. (Without anger or yelling) I am much less willing to sacrifice my happiness in support of his career goals, and that makes a huge difference. I don\u2019t do things i don\u2019t want to do anymore. I don\u2019t attend his work events if i don\u2019t want to go. I don\u2019t take shitty jobs to \u201cmake the best\u201d of the areas or position we are currently in.\n\nI have a degree in English education, but i worked in non profit. I\u2019m from a major city, so i was able to climb quickly. With the uncertainty of our relocations, a few months ago i decided to go back to school to focus on a field that offered me more flexibility and job stability/ opportunity. That\u2019s making me happy everyday. I enjoy what I\u2019m learning and I\u2019m not counting the days until he\u2019s done with school or we move to our forever home in the next state. I have a goal I\u2019m working towards. And honestly, i feel happy knowing that i will be entering a field that will provide me more opportunity should our relationship go south. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, we don\u2019t know what the future holds entirely. (In terms of our spouses behavior as a result of their academics/career) Maybe your spouse will graduate, he will become super attentive and helpful and your problems are done. Great. Maybe he won\u2019t. Now what?  The only thing we can do is prepare ourselves on how to best cope with these situations.

That was too much, but I needed the money and my research had to be delayed for very specific reasons dealing with my research.  Working Apple support was easy in that it was clock in and clock out.  Being an instructor was way more stressful and time consuming.  The work at Apple could be done on autopilot, but dealing with undergrads consumed every waking hour. \n\nObviously apply and see what is offered and pick the right program for you.\n\nBut walk in knowing specifically what you want to study.  If you show up and are trying to figure it out, that\u2019s ok if you\u2019re single.  If I took 3 years or 6, nobody cared but me.

So don\u2019t expect to stay in your town, get a PhD, and teach there.  Almost certainly you\u2019ll have to move.

I also didn't realise it was normal for PhD students to spend hours on video games and watching YouTube and avoiding housework and PhD work and feeling stressed in the evenings and not wanting to spend time with anyone let alone my SO, but this has basically characterised several years of my PhD! So thanks for helping me feel normal. Now I am nearing hand-in I have been getting a little more disciplined and organised and it feels good.\n\nI don't really know what to say in response to your initial question, except to say that I expect post-doc/early career to be equally hard but in a different way. I will likely be less isolated than during my PhD, and with a little more accountability. A PhD is one massive long-term project (at least in my country) and after the PhD research projects tend not to be quite as long, or even if they are, are broken up more into milestones, like publishing part of the research project. You never have to write such a long thesis again. There will be more teaching, which gets me out of the house and interacting with other people, and less fixated on research. But I think that the transition will also be tough for me, so I don't think post-doc is a quick fix to all the issues I've experienced during my PhD.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking about what I have done to help my relationship with my SO during this time. I have tried to balance my needs, and what I want to do in my downtime, with what they want to do, and maybe half the time will choose to do something that they want to do even if it's not my first choice. I find this helps us spend time together, and when we are feeling close and connected it also improves my mental health. We have kids too, which does make it harder to find the time, because I also need to make time for the kids (although it does help with the housework and food situation, because kids need to be fed and in a clean house and clean clothes, so we both do pull our weight getting it done) but overall I feel like it has taken some conscious decisions from me and from them to keep choosing each other despite all the other competing priorities.\n\nAnd what has my SO done for me that has helped: a) believed that I can do it, even when I am not believing in myself, and vocalised that to me and vocally supported me; b) treated my issues and difficulties with the PhD as real and I guess understood that a PhD is hard and also there are lots of mental health issues with PhD students, and made me feel like my concerns are legitimate and I'm not just a massive failure at life; c) gently told me when I am playing too many video games, even though I haven't always appreciated it at the time, it is an important message to hear!; d) not assumed that because I am the one at home that I will be doing all the housework, and tried as much as they can to make it 50/50. Maybe you are already doing all that stuff for your SO but if not then some of those things might help.\n\nUltimately though, my view is that relationships are a commitment and commitment is a decision primarily (with of course other important factors). During the last few years we have had some REALLY, REALLY BAD times but for both of us we are committed to the relationship and committed to making it work, and in my opinion that has made the difference, above and beyond 'love' (which is quite a difficult thing to define and pin down and feel. Commitment is less difficult, in my experience). Don't get me wrong, love is still important, but in my experience it's commitment that has made the difference in the worst moments.\n\nI hope this helps somehow.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dyposj/what_is_postdoc_life_like_asking_as_the_so/f84ewoz/"}, "893": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "rebfreak", "Date": 1574245597, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thanks for the kind words.

I don't recommend underestimating the level of math or programming skills you will need as a Finance PhD student. Even if your thesis is not so heavy on math, the courses you will take probably will be. Also, you will probably help with the research of your professors, and that can be very hard.\n\nI don't see people in Finance using SPSS, it seems to me that those who use SPSS are researchers who conduct experiments. Like people doing Consumer Behavior research in Marketing, following more of a psychology tradition. They usually do experiments, and rarely need something much more complex than some ANOVA in statistics. But people in Finance typically do not have the same level of control over things like those who do experiments, and then topics like endogeneity become a big issue, you need to learn how to use mixed models, time-series analysis, instrumental variables, etc. R seems to be common in Finance.\n\nOne of the professors here says that PhD-level students are expected to code, not to use \"point-and-click\" functions from SPSS.

Find the textbook(s).\u00a0 At least read the contents and begin studying the topics therein (it may not be wise to buy those particular books, even if you can find them, as they may be subject to change).\n\nFollow normal rules of studying a scientific field: work up to understanding the object of your study.\u00a0 If you don't understand something, look up its definition.\u00a0 Repeat until you're in familiar territory.\u00a0 Always keep in mind that some textbooks explain things poorly; if you don't understand something, look elsewhere.\u00a0 *At some point, you will almost certainly need to check a large number of sources in order to gain a complete understanding of each new concept.\u00a0 This is perfectly normal, and becomes increasingly common as the material becomes more advanced.*\n\n**How to convince the committee**\n\nYou want to show them that you've been actively engaging in material of a similar caliber.\u00a0 Taking a class in a closely related area (in particular, if it's roughly equivalent to the prerequisites of some courses in the program, or roughly equivalent to the courses themselves) shows that you've done the research and cared enough to pay for, show up to, and do well in the class.\u00a0 Other options include independent projects with some kind of \"product\" so that they know you've actually done what you say you've done.\n\n**Bonus**\n\nIf you're really serious about the program, look up its faculty members.\u00a0 Find and carefully read some of their publications.\u00a0 If you find any of those publications to be interesting, re-read them.\u00a0 Email the relevant faculty member(s) with some observation about their work, and ask an intelligent question about future directions (for example, if they say they'd like to do XYZ in the future, ask how they intend to do that).\u00a0 Express your interest in the program, and get your foot in the door.

For each paper, look at the citations and grab any that I'm missing, as well as using Google Scholar to find other papers that cite the one I'm looking at (and grabbing only relevant ones).\n* Export the Zotero collection to .csv format.\n* In Excel, I have a sheet which contains the exported Zotero library, and connections that I'm making (manually by reading through the citations in each paper).\n* I have a Matlab program that outputs code to generate a GraphViz plot of the citations.\n\nI hope there's a better way than this!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/e0zawf/creating_citation_graph_fo/f8lums4/"}, "1192": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ThisIsTheNightmare", "Date": 1574625997, "Score": 1, "Body": "Oh, that sounds pretty nice!

I have almost zero success getting him to actually answer any questions I ask him.\n\nHe also left my University for another one (about an hour drive away) about two years ago and I'm just barely going to graduate without running out of funding.

He wouldn\u2019t let me book my flight back which I thought was kind of weird but didn\u2019t really question. He actually made me stay there for 9 weeks working 12-24 hours/day 7 days/week by myself. I made the best of it but it was really isolating and scary at times. He would yell at us during lab meetings, broke a chair in front of a student, banned us all from taking time off, threw chairs, etc. \n\nI ended up just getting really anxious and I proceeded to work all weekends plus about 12+ hours normally. I didn\u2019t deal well with it, I basically just became his slave and I did everything he asked and never stood up for myself. In the 2.5 years I was there I did enough work to more than cover a PhD. I was just so scared of him and what he might do to my future as he was known for halting peoples progress in academia. To be honest, I was the golden child in the lab so I didn\u2019t even get the worst of it because I just rolled over and always did everything he wanted instead of pointing things out when he was being unreasonable.\n\nHe insisted that I go to Sweden for my PhD but I didn\u2019t want to and so he tried to stop me from graduating as I had accepted a phd position at another university. I ended up going to our departments graduate chair to talk about option to graduate without him and I found out he\u2019s done this before and he\u2019s barred students from graduating... anyways, I ended up using my friends and other PhD students to help me get a good thesis and I submitted and defended it with him. Before my defence he told me there\u2019s no way I was going to pass then proceeded to introduce me as the best masters student he\u2019s ever had. Either way I defended and had zero edits. \n\nUpdate as of last week he\u2019s being investigated by the university, he\u2019s lost his analytical lab, his research chair position and a bunch of students that I know have left his lab to graduate elsewhere. This will be his 3rd and (hopefully) final harassment investigation before the university let\u2019s him go. \n\nIt was really bad at the time and I developed some really severe anxiety BUT he is finally getting what he deserves.

I didn't explain the whole idea about shipofthesis in the post. If you open the link that I posted, it lists numerous points for doing this. Copying the text from the github repo of shipofthesis.\n\n# Motivations for the Ship of Thesis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Clickety stuff** The thesis is a static document on  so many levels. One of which is, there is absolutely no links except for  the internal links to equations and references. By having a github  repository, you can have direct links to the articles you are referring.  Plus, you can include links to both the arxiv version and the published  version.\n* **Animations** This is a continuation of the above  point. Now, your thesis lives on github, which means you can make your  thesis interactive. No more boring graphs and static picture. You could  have animations and widgets. Infact, you could have a jupyter notebook  version of your thesis.\n* **Crowd sourcing** Animations, hyperlinks and  generating an interactive version of the thesis are all great features,  but one may not be familiar with the techniques required to provide such  features. Enter crowd sourcing. As the author, you do not need to  provide all these features yourself. If there are people who liked your  thesis and have read it, they may do it for you. And it does not have to  be restricted to the feature addition, someone may like your thesis but  update a section to read much better. Or they may add additional notes  that could be of importance to other people. All they would need to do  is just fork a repository, update and do a pull request. In return,  please be sure to put them in acknowledgement.\n* **Time evolution** The biggest benefit of putting a  repository on github is that it becomes a constantly evolving document.  The changes could be as minimal as errata or could be where the new  document hardly remembers the original document. With github, all the  different versions are available, anyone interested could look up a  version from any given time.\n* **Forward and backward references** References lists  the previous works on which the current work builds. If the work was  completed 20 years ago, then there is a good chance that people built on  this work. With the constant evolution of the thesis, forward  references section could be a great way to include the works that builds  on the work in the thesis.\n* **Open questions** The open section could be a chapter  in the thesis or could be a separate document in the repository that  gets updated as and when people or you yourself conquer the new  unknowns.\n* **Thesis for layman** The github version could also  contains the unpolished version with lot more details which would help  people from outside the field read with less effort.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/e14s66/shipofthesisorg_making_an_opensource_and/f8mr39f/"}, "1202": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "johu999", "Date": 1574635062, "Score": 8, "Body": "I don't really understand the point of this service in relation to theses.

I persisted with doing the project we had originally agreed upon, but he doesn't talk to me unless it's about a paper. I've had no academic or emotional support at all from him whatsoever. And when I do publish a paper, he always has a go at me about not being listed as the corresponding author. He barely even *reads* my articles and hasn't contributed to the research or ideas at any point, so frankly he's lucky that I list him as an author at all. \n\nI've gotten more academic support from my partner's supervisor, because he's in the lab where I work a lot of the time and is genuinely interested in what I'm doing. I'm also lucky to have good emotional support at home and at university - it's a pretty small, close knit university so I know everyone from the lecturers to the Dean of research and they all have been extremely helpful and supportive, without me having to ask. Everyone just knows everyone at my uni so even the people in high-up positions will stop to chat with me and see how I'm doing, it's really wonderful. \n\nBut nonetheless, having such a shitty dynamic with my primary supervisor has definitely slowed my progress significantly. Also, a PhD degree in Australia should be 3-3.5 years, but my primary is deliberately delaying my progress with slow feedback and blatantly ignoring me and has openly said \"no, you'll be here for 4.5 years because that's the average in your field\", which I'm 99% sure is due to him wanting to milk as many articles out of me as he can. Meanwhile my secondary reckons I'm ready to graduate now at 2.75 years, I'm just trying to push through 1-2 more articles before I submit a thesis because I think that'll give me my best chance.\n\nAnyway, if you're asking because you have a bad dynamic with your supervisor, and you have the option to change - do it. I've only stuck mine out because it's a small university with not a lot of advisory options in my field, and I don't want to burn bridges and damage my chances of getting a job at this same university when I'm done.

Starting from scratch and building new tools is difficult and to always have them improving also takes lot of resources. Leveraging github resources solves this problem.

I'm still not done but the end is in sight.\n\nPros:\n1) Going part time allowed me to actually finish the PhD, I was basically ready to quit if I had to go back full time, it made me miserable. Spending half the time in a real world job enabled me to simply get up and go into an office at least for half a week and thus helped me feel like I'm able to accomplish something. As we all know it's very hard to feel accomplishment after a day or even weeks or months of PhD work. \n2) Staying on at the company I interned at meant I could continue my professional development (I knew at that point I'm not staying in academia) and have decent confidence I'll get a full time job I like after finishing the PhD. \n\nCons:\n1) Doubling the length of the remaining PhD time. Even though I experienced the bad parts of the PhD to a lesser extent due to being part time, I willingly signed up to endure it for twice the length. I can't wait to be free of it and give my mental health a chance to mend and recover. The depressing side of the PhD will sometimes bleed into the rest of my life and a part time job doesn't actually prevent it, it just lessens the intensity. \n2) It's very hard to do research part time. Sometimes you finally get into the zone and are ready to tackle a problem, but then you have to go back to work. Don't rely on using work day evenings or weekends for PhD work - you need time off to get your head out of work mode. Switching is very hard. I occasionally got better at it, it really depends on what a week happens to be like, but my PhD work definitely suffered. \n3) It's very hard to do research part time. Sounds like you're already not very connected to your research community, and going part time will make that alienation even stronger. I only recently read the advice of how important it is to have a strong connection to a research community in order to finish a PhD, and I've really felt that recently. If you're office isn't very helpful, try to see if there's any relevant group meetings, journal clubs, reading groups, seminars. \n4) Working part time can be frustrating. Even though I listed it as a pro to keep my job and professional development going, it's often been very frustrating to work part time, it does limit you in what sorts of work projects you can be involved with and what type of responsibilities you can get. \n\nAdvice:\n1) Spend some time really digging into your motivations for finishing the PhD. You might come to the conclusion it's not worth it or you'll come up with great reasons that will keep you motivated until you finish (full time or part time). This has been by far the biggest struggle for me, I've wished I quit many many times when I was low. \n2) Spend some time really digging into your motivation to go part time whilst finishing the PhD.

But how long-term-compatible is that with the *life* you want to have? I mean, things such as: you mentioned that you don't want to be away from friends and family, so how likely is it that after you do a PhD (and if needed a postdoc or two) abroad, you will be able to get a research and teaching position in your desired location? If that is reasonably likely (e.g., some academic institution nearby has an important extent of preference towards hiring people who did a PhD abroad in a school as good as yours), it makes sense to \"sacrifice\" and be away for a few years, as long as that won't make you so miserable that you wouldn't be able to work well.
