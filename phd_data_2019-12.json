Document it, tweak, repeat. You'll get there.\n\n\nYou should also give yourself credit for landing a spot in a PhD program. There are many more people that applied, but the committee chose YOU over them for a reason. That's an achievement! Congrats!\n\n\nAs for feeling dumb, I have a few things to say: \n\n\n1. You just increased in a tier of education. You were probably used to being near or at the top of your classes, yeah? Now imagine that in one of your classes, the bottom 90% of people disappeared. And you zoomed in on the grades of the remaining top percent. Even if you were at the bottom of that group, it only looks like a huge difference because you zoomed in. That's basically where you are at in whatever field you're in, in relation to the rest of Earth's population.\n\n2. I will take a 1st year labmate who feels dumb over one who thinks they know everything any day. If you feel dumb it's because you realize there's a lot you don't know, and this leaves you open to learning if you want to put in the effort.\n\n3. TA an undergrad class if you can. It's easy to forget where you started in your field, and how much you've learned so far. I thought I knew nothing about organic chemistry until I realized that these kids were coming in having never heard the words \"nucleophile\" or \"resonance\" in their life, and stick notation looked like a bunch of  shapes/lines to them.\n\n4. Talk to other people in your cohort. There's a reason Imposter Syndrome is a thing. I guarantee you at least half of them feel the same way.\n\n5. Make time to do something that's not related to your research. Like a hobby or an intermural. Drinking doesn't count. It's easy to get consumed by your work, and if you have nothing else going on, it's real easy to blur failure in the lab with failure of you as a person.

I think the bias you see on this sub is partly just because people come for advice when they need help with difficult problems, not when everything is rosy. I'm in quite a similar situation to you (UK PhD, minimum stipend, 3 years funding) and I think although there are a lot of positives, there are also some negatives which depending on the person and the department. These can really get you down and spoil the experience a bit:\n\n&gt;Aside from the research topic, I had full control over my methodology, questions, scope, etc.\n\n* This amount of flexibility and control seems quite unusual to me - often PhDs are limited by availability of resources or data, funding, expertise or desires of their supervisors, stipulations from the research. Additional things like ethics reviews, group politics etc can prevent you from studying what you want. \n\n&gt;**It felt like a massive privilege to undertake paid research.**\n\n* Whilst I completely agree it is a privilege and I feel very lucky to be paid to learn things everyday, I also understand that for some people the salary is hard to live on (in high cost areas, if you have a family to care for etc). Additionally, compared to what many of us could be making outside of PhD and what our peers are making, the PhD stipend is low. Money isn't everything but it can make it difficult to keep up with friends who have access to a different lifestyle. Just think, if you hadn't had to work your last year unpaid you could have put that saved money towards a deposit on a house!\n\n&gt;**I got the opportunity to do paid teaching**\n\n* Teaching pay at PhD level doesn't often include preparation time, which can sometimes vastly outweigh the timetabled teaching.  PhDs in STEM often can only do demonstrating work which is less pay. \n\n&gt;**I loved the travelling opportunities.**\n\n* Unfortunately with travel, it depends if you have time to visit the city or spend extra time there. My experience has been mostly stress from preparing for the conference, exhaustion from travelling, lack of sleep from long days and networking and then heading back to the office. \n\n&gt;**I was never lonely.** \n\n* I think when some PhDs say that they find it lonely it's not always the lack of drinking opportunities and social outings. It's lonely if you are stuck on a problem and no one can help you, or if you're stuck in working at the weekend or in the evenings. It's lonely if you don't have a desk or a shared office space on campus or you're being taken advantage of by someone else.  \n\nAside form all this, PhD is tough if you are perfectly healthy, financially stable,  no responsibilities outside work etc. If you've got health conditions, family problems, loss of loved ones, debt, children then it can make things near to impossible.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/e5nhds/am_i_the_only_one_who_enjoyed_doing_a_phd_here/f9l8odw/"}, "151": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Wednesday_words", "Date": 1575417315, "Score": 6, "Body": "That is wonderful.

Take care of paperwork with urgency. \n\nHave idea sessions where you spend about 5 minutes a day for a week generating ideas you want to investigate.  Maybe papers you want to read, areas you find interesting, and eventually, research you want to do personally.  Narrow this list at the end of the week and present your most achievable ones to your advisor.  Get data, read papers, and investigate how others have solved this and similar problems.  Try using existing data and reproduce another paper as much as you can.  Try changing it a little.  What did you learn?  What did you wish you could solve?  What techniques do you want to learn more about?  What kinds of papers do you want to read but aren't out there?  Repeat this process often: it's how you find a research direction.\n\nTake extra care to note what the expectations are in the best, most prestigious articles: what sets them apart?  What kind of language do they use, how do they talk about their method and experimentation?  Always be thinking about this when you read.  Don't skip terms!  If you see something you aren't familiar with, note it, and read more about it later, especially in the introduction and methodology.\n\nDon't do other people's research.  It's easy to just go along with your advisor/boss/friends/peers and go with their ideas.  Here's why it's important to come to value your own.  When you're writing your own paper, it will be so much work, and you'll have times when you don't understand the results, and you'll feel scared that you spent all that time, and you're not sure the hypothesis is valid.  You might decide to give up, because you don't really understand their idea. That's why it's super important that it's yours: you have to believe in your idea.  You have to understand your idea.  It's so important it's yours, because writing about your own idea, your own experiments, your own intuition: there's nothing like it.  You're proving to everyone you're right (or to yourself: you're wrong, and here's what you can learn).\n\nPapers: I've found that a 4 page paper for me takes a month, and an 8 page paper takes about 2 months.  This includes initial investigation, lit survey, finding or creating data, generating results over and over, writing (usually 1 day per page minimum, but that's including many cycles of rewrites).  Maybe I'll get faster, but that's my pace right now.  Get to know your pace so you can plan for submission deadlines.  When selecting a venue, look for the notification date.  See if that fits your current schedule of requirements.\n\nWriting papers: talk about your idea a lot.  Explain it often and to as many people as you can.  Record yourself talking about it.  This will become your writing.  I write all my sections by recording myself talking alone and later transcribing like this.  It's partly due to inspiration for writing often coming while away from a keyboard and partly due to fighting the temptation to edit while drafting.  Find a way to write about your ideas that works for you.\n\nI'm not sure about your program of historical geography, but for most people: you need at least 3 major publications to graduate (again, discipline-dependent).  So, have a goal of submitting at least 1 publication each year for your first 2 years and bump up your rate once you get an acceptance/time pressure.  The acceptance rate at good venues is not high, so rejection is typical.  The purpose is to build your skills as a scientist, writer and learn what your pace is.  Ask your advisor to be clear what publications count toward your dissertation requirements: are there venues that won't count? What about length requirements?\n\nGraduate school is building immunity to the fear that you won't make it.  My answer: I love doing research so as long as I can keep doing that, school or no school is fine with me.  It's hard to keep that focus when administrative pressure, absent advisor/committee, paperwork debacles, living on a student's income, competition with peers, etc. can really muddy the experience.  Whatever your reason for continuing to do research is, protect it.  You aren't guaranteed a phd or any \"result\" from this process until it's done.  If you get publications from it, fantastic.  If you get better as a writer, scientist, and researcher: that's what it's about.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/e6hi45/advice_you_wish_you_got_just_before_you_started/f9qx2ro/"}, "261": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Solkuss", "Date": 1575568643, "Score": 5, "Body": "Look for something else to support yourself.

There could be a simple positive explanation: In each project there is something like a \"max. potential level\". If a PhD student has a lot of good data on a relevant topic, it would be stupid of the supervisor to push too early too hard for a publication (assuming you have sufficient funding). What if you the time pressure led to a worse than possible outcome and you miss the opportunity to publish in a very good journal? That sucks. On the other hand, he and the Prof. probably think that the paper of this other student already exploited all its potential. There might be limitations to the method and data, but in itself it's probably a nice small thing that may suffice to get it into a second or third tier journal. You see my point? \n\nSecond, advisors have a clear benefit from their PhDs going on to collect data. Isn't it awesome, someone brings you all the high quality data and all you have to do later is writing it up? If you are lucky, that PhD student collected even so much data that you can salami-slice the data set and publish 2 or 3 papers out of it over the coming years. So yes, supervisors and PhDs have different interests, therefore the relationship is so difficult sometimes. Therefore, there is also the saying that it's not the supervisor who decided when a PhD finishes.

I'm at Cambridge (about as close to the other place as you can get) working in my probationary year right now. \n\nIt's certainly a transition. Oxbridge are both very old, nearing on **1000 years** now. That means they have a lot of traditions, most of which are complete bunk, and they can feel quite \"otherworldly\". No other university experience compares to it which means you're always going to be a little shell-shocked by the transition, especially if you're international or from a disadvantaged background. I've found it pretty hard to adjust but I've been assured that it's very common, and it does go away after a while, although you have to make an effort to leave Oxbridge regularly and escape the bubble here. \n\nIn terms of the PhD, your main focus in the first year is to find a project, find a supervisor, get your feet wet in your subject, and *have fun*. Happy to answer any more specific questions you have!\n\nBut some other key tips:\n\n - Don't take yourself or your work *too* seriously. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and if you want to be an interesting, enjoyable person to be around, you need to have outside hobbies and friends who are not in your cohort. \n\n - Talk to the postdocs. They're the ones who've most recently gone through the transition from PhD to academic job market so they can provide very valuable insight on what you should be focussing/working on to be competitive later. \n\n - Get a light-up alarm for the morning. Once it gets to winter it's just permanently dark and dreary (there are less than 8 hours of \"sunlight\" a day, and they'll all be cloudy) and you'll need the help waking up in the morning. Light is more gentle than a blaring alarm. Pro-game move is to take a caffeine tablet (less caffeine than even a single cup of coffee normally) in the morning while you're in bed - makes getting out of bed easier once it kicks in. [I'm very much not a morning person, in case you couldn't tell]\n\n - Make sure all of your jackets are waterproof or water-resistant. It's always drizzling. You don't *need* to be mildly damp every day. Water-resistant pants (like hiking pants) are also a god-send. Also get shoes with significant traction because once all the leaves fall, they make a slippery brown goo on all of the sidewalks and if all you have are sneakers, you'll go tits up on the reg.\n\n - Don't be in any rush to use your conference/travel funding. You only have a limited amount and you'll *really* want to use it when you get closer to graduating. Don't waste it now on conferences that you won't present at or that are super expensive. \n\n - Discuss early on what the work expectations are. What times should you be in the office? What meetings should you absolutely always go to? Which ones can you afford to miss sometimes? How often will you meet with your supervisor?\n\n - Look after the other first years. If someone looks a bit down, talk to them. If someone looks a bit left-out, include them. They'll return the favour when you need it. \n\n - If you're interested in doing any tutoring, find out early what training programmes you need to complete. Then, find out who the best tutor is in the department and ask them if you can sit in on one of their tutorials. This style of tutorial is unique to Oxbridge, so unless you did your undergrad there, you have no idea how they work and it'd be irresponsible to jump right in. If possible, leave it till your second term or later, once you're settled in. Oxbridge undergrads are precocious and intellectually demanding - they will expect you to provide significant extension work.\n\n - Don't spend heaps on a new bike because nice bikes are targeted by thieves and bike theft is basically the only crime at Oxbridge. Stolen O\\*ford cycles are sold in Cambridge and vice versa. Invest in a D-lock, never a chain. No lock is impenetrable to a determined thief with good bolt cutters, but they'll go for the most expensive and easiest bike to steal. Don't leave your bike locked up overnight in the theft \"hotspots\" in the middle of town. Make sure you have lights. \n\n - Always be aware of your surroundings. Cyclists will ride up quickly behind you on the footpath with no warning, and if you suddenly step to the side, you *will* be cleared out. Check over your shoulder before changing direction. They will also not give way to you at most crossings unless there are lights, so don't expect them to slow down or go around you. They will not. Many people cycle in Oxbridge because it's the done thing, not because they're good at it or know the laws. They will not indicate before turning. They will not stay on the road or in cycle lanes.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/e761t0/what_was_your_oxford_phd_like_especially_in_your/f9vu2g4/"}, "323": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "hueytlatoani", "Date": 1575683045, "Score": 9, "Body": "You have described the Mail Merge feature, available on most Office-type software suites.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/e75xzv/hi_id_like_to_help_you_send_cohorts_mail/f9vybpi/"}, "324": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jackskellybelly", "Date": 1575685933, "Score": 2, "Body": "Hello, I know this is not an answer to your question, but I have similiar research interests (media psychology).

You are concerned over lack of extra-curriculars and overall self-sufficiency/ street-smarts/ can-do-ability. OK.\n\n(I'm **NOT** agreeing with your assessment of yourself as 'without skills', or that you're 'not capable', anyone who gets a post-doc is **fecking capable**, but I'm some stranger so why would you trust me. Fair. Let us continue with your assessment of your own skills.)\n\nConsider that after 70-80-odd years you're going to pass. As am I. As is everyone. Whatever we have 'achieved' is not going to matter. This is not a bad thing. It's quite liberating. We're all going to be forgotten soon enough, heck, we might not even survive climate-change. So no pressure.\n\nNOW.\n\nSince it doesn't hurt - might as well:\n\n1. Go talk to that career counselor.\n2. Go talk to that mental health therapist.\n3. Get a guitar and start youtube each night. I'd say start with the E-minor chord. 'Zombie' by Cranberries is a nice first song to learn. Or anything else.\n4. Look up the DMV rules in your state and book an appointment.\n5. Toastmasters club is a nice way to gain confidence, a skill, and meet new people\n6. Go to university happy hours and say hi to someone from a different department\n7. Hit the gym. r/fitness has some decent workouts. 'Starting Strength' or the 5/3/1 program I'd suggest. Do not underestimate the power of the free and legal mood-enhancing drug - dopamine.\n\nRemember, your going will be slow. Maybe you do very little each day. Maybe you fail a bit (which any PhD should be familiar with) But hey - you're already doing things. This is literally how people build a repertoire of extra-curricular activities.\n\nALSO,\n\nTry not to think of the results. The point of doing these things is the 'doing' itself. The performance of the action is the goal. This is rather important. Too much misery is generated in expectation of a goal which may or may not happen. For example, I would go to the gym and not see results (over months). I kept trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. At one point it started working out, and my weight has started increasing (which is good). All throughout my target was never \"OH I GONNA BE SWOLE\" but rather \"Might as well go to the gym because I get that dopamine rush, and might as well do it properly since I'm spending hours there every week\". Dopamine rush is still the target. Eventually, after 3-4 months of consistent weight gain, I might change that.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nYour life, or mine, is not a movie where 'Bad thing/ feeling' is succeeded by 'montage' and then 'success', so don't expect that kind of plot.\n\nWe're just trying to pass the time until we die. Since you have a PhD, you've been passing it quite effectively my friend. Now it seems your requirements on how to pass your time have changed. So let's reorient your schedule to reflect that.\n\nOh, and you won't 'starve'. Worst case you move to Australia and become a professor there. Or some other place where they want professors.

I find it comforting and more real than the whole \"You matter and the world is your oyster\" thinking, and hence, I find it an effective way to dispel dark thoughts.

Hopefully I can give some insight.\nThere are different ways of doing a PhD here:\n\n1.\tYou apply to a research project that has received grant funding applied for by the PI. They then usually have some money to employ some PhD students and a post-doc. It varies how many etc. Then you are on the payroll for the duration of the project, and basically employed by the university. You may also get a teaching position (but won\u2019t really be necessary as funding should get you through, but it depends on your fee status). Big caveat here: The research aim and proposal is mostly regulated by the PIs and you don\u2019t have your own project.\n2.\tYou can also apply to a PhD programme with your very own proposal, and then find funding externally. This could be from your home country, research councils in the UK (such as ESRC, or AHRC), sometimes from the EU ( but since your not an EU national that isn\u2019t really an option, plus who knows with Brexit), or your own private funds. In this scenario, you are not employed by the uni. Every good university homepage should offer a research funding finder where you can enter all your details and relevant funds you can apply for will be shown. Some grants offer tuition and living costs, some only tuition. So be aware of that! You\u2019re usually given the option in your 2nd year of study to be a tutor/teaching assistant. The money you earn from these positions will most definitely not cover your living expenses and tuition, but will be a nice addition. Remember that you can also get a job out with the university, but that can be a strain with overall work-life balance.\n3.\tYou apply for a PhD and are entirely self-funded. Sometimes you\u2019ll be able to apply for other funds in the second or third year, but this is subject specific.\n\nI hope this helps.\nMaybe other people can add other options, but these are the three scenarios my colleagues and I are in.\n\nCan I ask which university you\u2019re considering?\n\nEDIT: it is very common to apply for your own funding.

The idea that your field of study needs to be directly related to your career is an extremely outdated mode of career development. In fact, there is no industry in existence that's closely related to my field. Still, I utilize skills and knowledge from my PhD experience daily even though my work doesn't seem related at all. I'll tell you what I did.\n\nRe: technical skills: I'm a Humanities PhD that doesn't know how to code, and has no quantitative or statistical analysis experience at all. Often when people think about relevant technical skills, these are the skills they're thinking about. So, how did I have so much success on the nonacademic job market without these skills? \n\nFirst, I attended resume workshops to understand what my skills actually were and how different a resume is from a CV. I learned that the valuable skills I have include critical thinking, writing and written analysis, presentation and teaching, curriculum development, project management, etc. I started researching jobs that utilize those skills to find out what job titles might be appropriate for me. \n\nI used resources like Versatile PhD and Imagine PhD to search for jobs and took skills and values assessments. I cold emailed Humanities PhDs who were doing things I find interesting and did informational interviews with them to find out how they got there. I kept in touch with those folks and also followed through with their suggestions to meet with other folks doing work I found interesting. \n\nI got feedback from people I trusted on all of my job documents. I attended job fairs (even ones primarily aimed at undergrads) and talked to recruiters to find out if there were any opportunities for me.\n\nIn other words, I networked and I hustled. From all of this, you might think I'm someone who was innately comfortable with these things, and you'd be dead wrong. I was out of my comfort zone throughout this process, but I was motivated to follow through because I refused to be underpaid and undervalued for my skills. \n\nThe job offer I ended up accepting wasn't actually acquired through any connections I had, but the other two job offers were. And without going through all of this and practicing, I never would have had the confidence to perform well through the interview process of my current job. \n\nI recommend checking out the nonacademic job resources at The Professor Is In, and finding other organizations for PhDs outside of academia.

It really depends on a lot of factors, what you personally want and just the random-chance element that is involved.\n\nMy experience with a molecular biology Ph.D. and subsequent work has left me wondering if it was worth it.  I mean ultimately I think it was, not sure I would be in my current position had I not done it, and aspects of my actual graduate experience were definitely worth it.  But really what a Ph.D. comes down to is mortgaging 5 years of your life to put into the hands of a PI who may or may not give you the time of day for a project that (since it is research) may or may not amount to anything regardless of how much work you put it.  So there is a lot of chance involved.  Not only that it is extremely unlikely you would go from getting your Ph.D. into a proffessor/faculty/Director level position, usually you will end up slumming it as a postdoc for many more years to come, sometimes multiple postdocs...which is just a continuation of that limbo.  All that time you are going to be getting paid like a third of the equivalent level of someone just going direct to industry.\n\nRelative to that just deciding to go direct into industry you might find it initially a lot more rewarding, both financially and in terms of the real-world experience you gain.  The issue comes in that sometimes there is what amounts to a degree-check in what sorts of jobs or work you'd be considered for and you'd end up with a bit of a glass ceiling.\n\nI view jobs in the sciences as being similar in some ways to the military (i've never been in the military so this is more like a pop-culture version of the military not sure if its like the actual military so actual veterans please be kind)...there are enlisted people and officers and each have their own separate development tracks, but regardless of how high you are as an enlisted man you are typically viewed as \"beneath\" an officer even if they are relatively new.  In otherwords you can be in a situation where you are a technician with 20 years of experience who is having to conduct work thought up by a new postdoc.\n\nNow if what you love to do is benchwork and being part of a team then just going direct to industry is maybe what you want to do.  If your idea of a good time is being the leader of a team or coming up with the research strategy that other people then execute as you get to pour over the data and make decisions on what to do next then you are going to want a Ph.D...but go into it knowing that a Ph.D. can be a bit of a roll of the dice in terms of success.  \n\n\nI mean I'm pretty sure that most top industry people have Ph.Ds, so definitely can go get a Ph.D and end up in industry.

As you said, that can be a huge problem because it's largely your supervisor who decides what counts as \"enough\" output, and even if it's technically against the rules, they can still arbitrarily delay your graduation just to get a couple more years of cheap labour out of you. You tend to have a lot of respect and trust for your PI, so all they have to do is suggest that you're not ready and you'd probably delay graduation for them.\n\nIn the UK, the time limit is set to 3-4 years for funding (you can continue working longer without being paid, it depends though). Because it's practically already decided that you *have* to submit around the 3-year mark, it means that they're more accepting of whatever results you have. You can get a PhD on negative results if you can show that you've done good research and understand the topic. In the US, you'd probably delay graduation until you had \"enough\" positive results to write up instead. I'll admit that 3 years does feel a little bit too short, but there are more programs now extending to 3.5 years in the first instance which seems just enough. I still prefer the UK system though - a PhD is about training in research, not training in getting specific positive results. Someone who makes a bunch of breakthroughs in 3 years isn't necessarily a better researcher than someone who found null or \"complicated\" results after 3 years.

I usually never write the intro before I'm finished, unless it's about stating my research question. Usually I start with a chapter in between, but that varies maybe also from field to field. Some people gather many notes beforehand, some go along as they research.

Set yourself exactly two hours a day to write concentrated on your piece. That could save your life. It sounds very little, we usually aim for 8 hours in the library but who are we kidding. Usually of those 8 hours, only 1 or 2 are productive. So cut down to those and give your everything, but don't exhaust yourself.\n3. Get into free writing. Write small pieces of fiction or journal, for 10 minutes. You have to put your inner editor and critic aside. Otherwise you will be surgeoning on every word.

So I'm worried about how I\"ll handle balancing multiple times the workload with teaching/research assistantship responsibilities etc. \n\nI found undergrad quite stressful, but I was pursuing a double major, working multiple jobs (and managing the financial insecurity that came with it), performing research, and doing a lot of outreach work that took me out of classes for weeks on end. It was never the coursework alone that made me stressed, it was juggling many commitments. Most undergrads have *some* kind of outside commitment - work, family responsibilities, research, sport, clubs etc - which causes a lot of stress. University should be treated like a full-time job and they're trying to work more than one. I'm sure loads of undergrads would find things pretty easy if they only took on an average courseload and had no other responsibilities sapping their time. \n\nI'd be more worried that you have no experience in managing multiple \"streams\" of work. A PhD requires you to juggle more than just coursework and research - you'll have many other responsibilities.\n\n&gt;Is it really that stressful and is the stress/pressure constant?\n\nYes, it is that stressful. There is a constant baseline of stress just due to the nature of how we work. Very few things are \"required\" or \"mandatory\" in a PhD, but there are plenty of things that you need to do if you want a shot at getting a job. And unlike in undergrad, that work is never actually done. It doesn't matter how many hours I work or how many papers I publish, I can always do more because there's no end. In undergrad you have semesters and assignment due dates and grades. I have none of that. There is little guidance on what to do, how to do it, or when to do it by. If you're an anxious person like me, you'll default to the mindset of \"this must be completed ASAP\", which means overworking and burning yourself out. \n\nAnd then there are the spikes in stress when you do have a few deadlines around the same time, which always seems to happen. Grant applications, undergraduate grading, thesis drafts, and presentations will always seem to happen in the space of a few days. Sometimes other people make mistakes or we simply have bad luck and I have to drop everything and scramble to fix it. That's acute stress. But I think it's the constant, low-level stuff that slowly drives people a bit weird.\n\nI've had mental health troubles for a long time, but I've put a lot into my treatment. I saw a team of mental health professionals every week during undergrad, then took a year off before my PhD to make sure it was under control. I think I'm managing it reasonably well now but it has taken nearly 7 years of different treatments to find what works and develop good coping mechanisms.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/efu7a7/how_stressful_is_a_phd/fc2w1lr/"}, "1193": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1577378374, "Score": 20, "Body": "The most stressful part of grad school is often managing the human relationships.

University tutoring jobs pay sweet cash though I'd get in in writing that you'll get some minimum hours to tutor per semester. Those also on campus so that saves time.\n\n2. You may get an APA if you publish in your first year or do some other thing that's important in your field, as you'll have good documented experience.

This could be as simple as arranging for them to have a brief conversation (if not in person, then by Skype or phone) which ends in the faculty member accepting the student's/ former student's apology. This was a misinterpretation of email tone, not anything egregious like plagiarism etc.\n\nThat's not the university's job or responsibility. First, you're an adult (and from the sounds of it a 'mature student' as well) so you are responsible for your own relationships. Second, the university can't force me to 'reconcile' with any student, and you seem to be running on the assumption that this professor would accept your apology (or should be compelled to). Third, if it were me I'd want to be No Contact with you because if you misconstrue a single email *to the point where you file a formal complaint against me with my chair*  then I would be worried that you would similarly misconstrue future communication. Finally, and for what? the relationship between a professor and an undergrad is ephemeral by nature, if you've graduated then your 'relationship' is over, with the exception of things like an LOR. Unless there was something sexual  between you... which would change things but not in a good way.\n\n&gt; It seems almost vengeful to allow a student/ex-student to wallow in guilt/anxiety instead arranging for them to have a 5-10 minute conversation with the faculty member. \n\nVengefuls quite a strong word... if that's been your situation then you really do need to talk to a therapist. I'm not clinically trained or anything and even if I was I wouldn't try to diagnose over the internet (I do have mental health first aid training and have done the Army's mental health stress resilience thing); that's not normal, you shouldn't be 'wallowing' in guilt no matter the circumstances. Talk to someone, they'll help you process this (closure's a myth btw). \n\n&gt; Personally, I think this may stem from my housing situation. The department arranged for me to stay at a faculty member's house when I became housing insecure during my last semester. It wasn't with the chair, but he was initially empathetic and allowed the dept. to help me.\n\nWait, what? you were living at a faculty members house?\n\n&gt; However, I left that faculty member's house after two days because it was filthy, moved around a lot, and ended up filing a complaint with the Board of Regents for their housing policies.\n\nWTF... how is allowing an undergraduate to *live* with a professor part of any university's housing policy? also housing policy? isn't that your responsibility? again, you're an adult... we make univeristy owned housing available for rent by undergraduates but actually making sure they have somewhere to live is their responsibility... and I've have worked in the US as well as the UK... \n\n&gt; This is when I noticed a change in my relationship with the chair.\n\nhuh, yeah, I bet...\n\n&gt;So once I graduated and he was no longer obligated to interact with me, he didn't want to bother with this. He probably filed the formal grievance because it was a \"quick solution\" that would allow him to \"cover his ass\" with the least amount of effort. \n\n&gt; I could be wrong, but it seems odd for a chair to take such drastic measures over an email misunderstanding\n\nunder normal circumstances I'd be obligated to file a formal complaint if a student asked me to, it's not my job to evaluate the merits of the complaint, this has become even more true in the wake of #MeToo \n\n&gt; (especially when they know the student and professor to have a good rapport).\n\nwhy would the chair know that?

I had hoped we could have stayed in touch, at least once in a while. However, even if this was unrealistic to have hoped for, I still didn't want any animosity between us.\n\nthat's life, it happens. \n\n&gt; hey would leave dirty dishes piled in the sink for most of the day, they didn't even have soap in the kitchen (I don't think they washed their hands before handling food), their cooking utensils and silverware didn't shine the way clean utensils and silverware usually do, the shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, etc. Basically, they never cleaned anything. I once saw his fiance wipe one counter with water, but they never applied any disinfectant or cleaning solution to any surface. They were also very disorganized.\n\nYou have OCD, from the sounds of it (looking at a few of your posts in the OCD, anxiety, and limerance subreddits) untreated. Your perecption on the 'cleanliness' of the house isn't to be trusted. My brain perceives many threats in things that aren't threats, because I have PTSD, through therapy I've learned to understand that just because I perceive the popping of a balloon to be a threat doesn't mean it is. The fact that you chose to be homeless rather than live in 'filth' (which sounds like a perfectly normal situation) demonstrates that whatever you may claim your OCD is not 'a positive trait'. \n\n&gt;  I mentioned staying briefly at the professor's house (and leaving bc of the unsanitary conditions).\n\nyou may have massively screwed that professor. Letting a student live in their house is wildly inappropriate (whatever the circumstances) and they were trying to do a nice thing, not only did you insult them by leaving their 'filthy house' but you reported them to university authorities (even if that was not your intention.)\n\n&gt; I had actually had a couple of classes with the chair, and in one of my papers I had excessively quoted the other professor's work (to the point of it being slightly tangential to the material. (He even commented on this but also seemed amused by it, adding \"Go___! [professor's first name]\"). This wouldn't necessarily show how much I admired her, but I also gave her a stellar teaching evaluation with details specific to my identity and had devoted much of my statement of purpose to her. (I had also mentioned how much I wanted to work with her to others in the department.) So between all of this, he probably knew of my regard for her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given this info., when he saw that my complaint was mostly about her tone, he should have (in my opinion) sensed what was going on and offered to meet with me in person to discuss the situation and get a better idea of what I wanted (or at least encouraged me to talk to her directly). I understand that in certain situations (i.e. where there's sexual harassment involved etc.), a formal complaint has to be filed, but from what I've read in other university's grievance polices, students are typically encouraged to first speak to the faculty member before proceeding with a formal grievance in most situations. This also makes sense from the point of deescalating a situation. \n\nYour expectations of people are massively out of kilter. You are one of hundreds of students the chair and your professors deal with. These people don't know you well enough to make that assessment. They don't have the time to make those assessments (seriously, teaching accounts for 1/3 of my contractual duties, so even if we assess on the 60 hours a week I actually work that leaves 20 hours for teaching. 5 of those hours are actually spent in a classroom, 5 of those hours are spent prepping, leaving 10 hours for 300 students. That means I have 2 mins per week for any one individual student... and that's an average.) Also, again, re the complaint, complaints are taken seriously, they have to be, especially in the current climate. \n\nAlso policies and procedures for dealing with things like grievances exist so that we don't have to make judgement calls. Not only do I not have the time to assess whether your complaint is 'legitimate' or just 'whining' but if I get it wrong and ignore it then I could be in a world of shit, so yeah we do cover our asses. A frivolous complaint can be dismissed once its clear its baseless but its not my job (or the chairs necessarily) to make that assessment. But part of the whole point of MeToo was that people were dismissing legitimate complaints as frivolous too easily so now we take all complaints much more seriously, at least at point of first report. \n\n&gt;However, even on the assumption that he had to file that grievance, once I explained what happened and that my anxiety was involved etc., he should have been more willing to talk to the professor on my behalf and help us work this out (knowing how much she meant to me). Had it not been for the housing drama before all of this, I think he might have been, but I\"m not 100% sure. It seems, however, that the university just doesn't want to bother with me, and now that I'm not a student, they don't have to. \n\nWhy? its not the university's job to fix your personal or professional relationships. If the professor is no longer talking to you then that should tell you everything you need to know. You burned that bridge, accept that and move on.\n\n\n&gt; Again, the initial situation (the email misunderstanding) seems like a very \"reconcilable\" situation. \n\nIt probably would have been, but then there's everything that you did after that, which changed that situation. There is no reset button in life. \n\nAs I said in an earlier post, you really need to talk to a therapist, they'll help talk you through this situation. I understand that your mental health issues are causing you to perceive this situation in a certain light but I don't think that you understand that. A therapist will help you understand that you are not seeing this clearly or objectively. A therapist will help you to 'find closure' without needing to speak to this professor (which I can all but guarantee won't happen, and even if it does there's no guarantee she'd accept your apology or explanation). \n\nIt might seem absurd to describe this as a 'traumatic incident' but one of the things that happens with PTSD is we get 'stuck' in that moment in time, and while I'm not qualified to diagnose you and wouldn't dream of doing it over the internet even if I was, I implore you to seek help. I've seen what this obesssion can do to people and it isn't pretty, but you can be helped and you deserve help. But reliving and re-examining this over and over again, particularly on the internet is not going to help you.

I never said you deserve to bullied. I've said you should listen to the advice that others have given you, because you should. I'd tell my clients the same things I've told you.  Alsoooooo... if you're inclined to listen to Master's students like you said, here's your chance (why do you think I'm in the PhD group????).\n\nSo...anyway, I asked because sometimes certain meds/treatments work well for one diagnosis but not another. You may have tried things for OCD that haven't controlled it and could benefit from seeking help and seeing if something else would work for you. There is definitely something going on with the way you're perceiving the words and actions of others and assuming the worst. Even psychologists make errors so getting another eval could get you on the path to recovery. It is frustrating to see you on here saying the same things over and over but not listening to a single piece of advice.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/efu7a7/how_stressful_is_a_phd/fcj31df/"}, "1479": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "UlfricTheMaineCoon", "Date": 1577678762, "Score": 3, "Body": "I have a PhD in education.

I have heard and also agree/believe that if your only motivation to complete a PhD is for a title, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna have a bad time.\u201d You really need to 1) want a PhD for its own sake; 2) have an idea that you\u2019re passionate about; 3) have the willingness to devote 4-5 years to the process of learning to think and act in the way that those with PhDs do. If these ring true for you, then it does make sense for you to go for it.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re only seeking to validate a method, you have to ask yourself if you can\u2019t do that in another way on your own over the course of 5 years or less. I think it would take you less than 5 years to collect some data on your teaching method to write up a report on. \n\nRemember also that getting a PhD includes taking graduate level courses. You may find them helpful, OR you may feel like they\u2019re distracting you from your goals. You may even have conflict with the instructors/material if your new method is disruptive to traditional models that they might be teaching. Or it could be illuminating and give you new perspective.\n\nLast, a PhD dissertation usually consists of multiple chapters, each relatively significant in length. You have to consider that once you validate learning rate/learning outcomes or whatever metric you want to measure, are there other places you will take your dissertation or will you want to go back to selling it to schools? Your committee may think that your initial conclusions are commensurate with a master\u2019s thesis and not a PhD dissertation, and you may end up feeling trapped or that you made a mistake once you come to your initial conclusions, if you feel they\u2019re sufficient to match what you wanted to prove going in.\n\nI think ultimately you have to ask yourself if you can or cannot validate your method on your own in less than 5 years.
