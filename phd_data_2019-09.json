During the time I was funded and doing a PhD, I lost a lot of time mainly because of my supervisors. I had to go through 3 supervisors, the only one that was somewhat a decent guy passed away. My first supervisor was so bad they actually went through the effort of taking measures against her, which truly means something in academia... I transferred to two other supervisors, the one that eventually passed away and another which is still my main supervisor. He's also quite bad (I've seen incredibly good researcher get a burnout from doing their PhD with them), but compared to my first supervisor he's the better of two evils. He would actively block my progress if I didn't do exactly as he wished, even if his decisions were erred or unethical and even after discussions of months and being backed by a group of others. 3 months before my funding ended, we found out that because of errors he made, the analyses of the 3 manuscripts I had written so far had been flawed and everything had to be re-analyzed, re-written, ... After already having quite a toxic relationship with my supervisor, often being belittled and having to pull crazy hours to make up for many smaller errors he made, I got sick. I was on sick leave for a month (which wasn't nearly enough) and continously felt nauseous, had daily migraines and had panick attacks .\n\nThat was around two years ago... Amazingly, while I was on sick leave, I found another job (also in research but in a university college). I had really low self-esteem and I didn't think I would get a job because of the lack of output, but I only did one interview and immediately got the job (although I feel like I coincidentally said a lot of 'right things' so it was mostly luck). The main takeway here being that we get brainwashed into thinking we can't get a job if we don't have output but that isn't necesarily the case.\n\nMy physical and mental health is a lot better than it was two years ago, though I'm still struggling. I feel like my PhD experience changed me for the worse because it felt so incredibly abusive, and that I definitely suffer some stress-related disorder as a result of the PhD process and some prior experiences. I've been seeing a psychologist for almost a year now.\n\nI'm still trying to finish the PhD 'on the side', or at least get one (or a few) articles published. At the moment, I still have no real output from my PhD. This is something that I still struggle with. While I was working on the PhD full-time, I didn't mind pulling in the extra hours because I was convinced that it would be 4 years of hard work and then I'd get a PhD. That obviously didn't plan out, and this increased the threshold to put in the same amount of hours again. I can't keep doing this for God knows how many years. On the other side, I want to get my ideas out there and I want to proof that I'm not the one who screwed this up. To add a positive note, I want to stress that even though doing a PhD 'on the side' is a lot, not working in that toxic environment on a daily basis anymore did wonders for my mental and physical health.\n\nIf I can give you any advice, it would be to reflect on what the PhD means for you. What does it mean for you to finish it? And can you reach this in another way? How much effort would it take to publish the article elsewhere? And is this something that you would be able to do while applying for another job, or even working at another job?\n\nI also truly hope that you find another job, and that you can find another therapist. I have no words for how horrible it must be to unexpectedly lose your therapist of 6 years, especially when you already suffer PTSD. I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope there are some affordable alternatives to get help in Norway? If you're not ready to look for a new therapist yet, you could consider some (temporary) low threshold help like forums, mental health apps, crisis lines, ... I've even heard about services like talkspace, who offer (supposedly) affordable sessions with therapists through video calling. I hope you can find something that offers some relief.\n\nI know that it seems like a lot right now. I hope it helps a little to know that others (like me) have been there.

In my field, that would look really good (although I don't really know if it works the same in your field).\n\nSome background on me: I've worked fulltime on my PhD for 4 years.  I had 3 manuscript as good as ready when those 4 years ran out, but due to errors made by my supervisor we discovered all the analysis had to be rerun, and everything re-written. I burnt out at that time (or I had been for quite some time, but this was the metaphorical drop that made the bucket overflow). That was 2 years ago. Since then, I've been working on my PhD on top of a fulltime research job elsewhere (unrelated to my PhD). I have all my data, but I still have to write everything. I'm working on the first article at the moment. We mainly aim for 4 articles bundled together with an introduction and discussion for a thesis in my field. \n\n**What did you do last week? (Brainstorm everything, but especially congratulate yourself for things that went well, any struggles you overcome. Recognising when you achieve milestones is important.)**\n\nI send in my manuscript for feedback at the end of June. My co-supervisor suggested to re-run the analysis, and gave some feedback on the introduction and methodology section. Saturday I wanted to rerun the analysis but I found out my license of the software program I need expired. Just some of the hassle that comes with working on your PhD on the side... I mailed my department for a renewal of the license. Then I re-read and re-structured my introduction. When I think about congratulating myself, I guess I should be proud for going through the introduction again (even though I didn't work through it entirely as I had planned), since I was a bit frustrated at some of the suggestions of my co-supervisor (especially that it 'wouldn't take much time to rerun the analysis' - everything takes time when you're doing it on the side) and I could have just as easily given up for that week.\n\n**What does this project need now?**\n\nStart re-running the analysis, re-writting introduction and methodology section.\n\n**Goals for the week:**\n\nHave a new version of my introduction ready, start to re-run the first phases of the analyses (which runs for quite some time, but just requires that you start it up so it should be feasible).\n\n**Distractions/Issues/Focus:**\n\nMy actual fulltime job, being away with friends this weekend, lack of a license for the software program, my laptop that's starting to break down, the fact that the whole 'history' I already have with this PhD makes me feel drained whenever I want to start working on it (even though I do invest enough time in self-care at the moment).\n\n**Self-care: What will you do to ensure you take time off and get away from the work?**\n\nThat's quite of a difficult one. The leisure time that I 'plan' (e.g. taking photography classes, planning to go for walks, ...) can feel like another goal that I can fail (something like what OP mentions). On the other hand not planning what to do in my leisure time often means sitting on my couch, staring at the TV and feeling empty. I've planned a weekend getaway with friends, so I hope that will help... But I've been feeling quite disconnected from them, and a bit annoyed at them because they can be very superficial.

That can help you to understand what has been done so far, what needs to be done, what are the gaps, etc. It can also provide ideas for other topics close to it.\n\n\\- It's better to have a good idea about what topic you would like to do. But you still need to be open-minded, because you are expected to evolve over time during the PhD, and that's hard if you are too attached to some idea.\n\n\\- The topic is related to the motivation in the SoP. So, it also depends on how \"laser focused\" is your motivation.\n\nI will try to illustrate with my example.\n\nMy background is mostly in Finance, but I also had some experience with Marketing.

But I would have trouble explaining an extremely specific motivation. Like, if I say that my topic of interest is to understand how prior brand reputation moderates the impact of brand equity on shareholder value, that's very specific, but my motivation isn't that specific. And that would make harder to find an advisor who would be really a great match, because it's too specific.\n\nOn the other hand, if I just say that my topic of interest is studying the challenges that Marketing managers face in real life, that so broad and vague that feels too far from my motivation. Potential advisors would also have a hard time to know if they could be a good match, because they don't really know what kind of challenge I'm talking about.\n\nAnd I don't really recommend seeing other people's SoP.

Jobs in industry are often an alternative, but still not necessarily something the schools want. For some fields, jobs with government are also common goals. As I said, it depends a lot on the field. \n\nI guess the general reasoning is the following. A high level PhD is usually hard, very hard. It's hard for the students, it's hard for the professors, it's hard for the department, the school, etc. It requires time, effort, knowledge, money. \n\nSo, it does make sense to do that when you think that the return will be bigger than the investment. \n\nAt the very least you will be investing years and years of your life, probably forcing you to put everything else aside. A career, social life, time with friends / family / girlfriend / whatever. \n\nA PhD can put your whole life on hold. For example, you do a PhD, planning to get a job as a school teacher after that. And then, you will be over 30 years old, just beginning a career, with little to no experience in teaching. A common complaint is that everyone else is moving on with their lives, but a PhD student is stuck, not being able to see their careers growing, to make their financial situation improve, to see friends and family, to marry and have kids, etc., etc. \n\nTo do something like that, I believe PhD students need strong reasons to make that kind of sacrifice, and still be happy with it for all those years. Love for research doesn't seem a strong enough reason for that. And we often see that love turning into hate when things get ugly. \n\nWhen experiments starts to fail, when papers get rejected, when you have to throw the effort of a whole year in the trash. People start to think \"Is this really what I love?\"\n\nSo, if this is not a means to an end, it just looks like a bad idea or masochism. \n\nUsually we face all that, because it's going to be worth in the end.

I would be surprised if the presentation format is totally inflexible. If it needs to go through a digital projector, you could perhaps use a tablet computer and a pen. \n\nAs to whether it should impact you choosing to do a PhD...\n\nA scientist's job is as much a professional writer as a researcher - your thesis, review and research papers, conference papers, posters, and grant applications will all require a lot of writing. \n\nThe good news is that being able to write and present well are very valuable skills both inside and outside academia and a PhD will give you lots of opportunities to develop them, including courses on scientific writing and communication. \n\nBut the informal learning opportunities are the best. For my undergrad I had to do a couple presentations: I worked really hard on them and tried to make them very flashy, memorise them, and apply all the half-baked presentation advice from the internet like 'don't read from the slides'... in fact I totally overdid them. Having to give regular lab meeting presentations for my PhD, and watching other people give theirs every week, I soon found I could bring a slide deck together really quickly and talk through my work without needing to rehearse. There's a knack for putting together data in a clear and intuitive way you just get after a while. \n\nSo you will need to write and present for your PhD but you won't be expected to already be brilliant at it. You will get lots of chances to learn and improve. \n\n(by the way, if you want my tips for putting together a presentation slideshow: \n\n* don't try to be flashy, try to be clear. No slide transitions or effects, you're not lauching an iPhone. Present data in the simplest way possible, not the cleverest way possible. \n* put a title on the top of each slide. The title should explain the point you're making in that slide. It should be possible to read out all the titles in order in your slide deck and understand your argument. (This is called 'horizontal logic')\n* all the points on each slide should be on one topic and should reinforce each other. (This is 'vertical logic'). Be really strict about this and get rid of superfluous text. If your evidence is contradictory you can split it across multiple slides (x seems to be caused by y, next slide, but z doesn't occur so there may be something else). \n* typically you want one slide for every minute of the presentation. It's a good starting point: five slides for a five minute presentation, thirty slides for a thirty minute presentation. That doesn't mean that every slide takes one minute to go through. \n* You CAN read off your slides. The points on your slide should remind you of what you need to say. It's okay to read off your slide - as long as you don't JUST read off your slide. Don't write word-for-word what you want to say. \n* be consistent as to which side of a slide you put figures on and which side you put text. It makes it easier for the audience to follow. \n\nGood luck!)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d0eyq0/should_finding_trouble_writing_and_creating_a/ez95elv/"}, "234": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "KirillDaneven", "Date": 1567775583, "Score": 1, "Body": "After delaying your work once you start delaying twice and then more.

In my opinion...\n\nSciences tends to be structured more like an office job with an expectation to be in the lab during working hours. You get a lot of contact with more senior scientists and other PhDs in the department or faculty. This is good in its own way but means you're typically more distanced from university life. \n\nHumanties PhD students tend to work alone and get less contact with peers in their faculty. They get more freedom to organise their time though and so find it easier to join clubs &amp; extracurriculars and socialise that way instead. In this way I would say it's more similiar to a taught degree than a science PhD is, but you have to be very self-motivated and its much easier to fall through the cracks than if you are a science PhD. \n\nBoth science and humanities PhDs have to work very hard. Unlike working in industry or for a company though, your performance at a PhD is an investment in yourself, because hopefully the better your PhD goes, the better a candidate you appear on job applications. Therefore, inevitably you will find yourself working harder and longer hours to do better. \n\nIt is immensly emotionally testing. Everyone will get overwhelmed once or twice in their PhD and have a crisis about it. I don't think anyone is truly prepared for how much failiure is a part of their PhD. Really a PhD is just what you get at the end of a marathon of failures! In the sciences, most of your experiments will not work. Almost all of them won't. By the end of your PhD, when you've finally found which experiments work well enough, you would probably be able to redo all the lab work from your thesis from scratch within six months. \n\nThere are upsides though! You get paid (or a stipend) to do research that interests you, which is actually a really sweet deal. You will learn more and faster than you had any idea was possible. And although people panic about careers post-PhD, particularly how difficult the academic route is, it really can open doors for you in lots of careers.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d0acuq/whats_the_lifestyle_of_a_phd_student_like/ez9dfao/"}, "246": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "theoneandonlypatriot", "Date": 1567780074, "Score": 2, "Body": "I\u2019m still trying to generate results in time for me to defend next month", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d0d74w/graduating_in_a_month/ez9e2m9/"}, "247": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "g6922", "Date": 1567780582, "Score": -23, "Body": "How are women defying the odds in grad school?

And some put every man and his dog on there.\n\nI was a bit weirded out by it when I wrote my first paper. I did all the concrete work on it, and wrote the actual paper. It made sense that my supervisors would be coauthors, especially given how much help I had leading up to it, but then so-and-so who I'd never met or even heard of ended up being coauthors. It wasn't the whole group, but there was the guy who developed the idea for the broader topic that I was working on a piece of, as well as someone who made a material that I used in experiments. For the latter, previously I would have assumed an acknowledgment and a citation would be enough. The development of the material was already published, and her contribution to my work was saying \"yes\" when I asked if I could use some. It wasn't instrumental to my work. I could have used anything in that class of materials, so I felt that although it was nice to have the materials, it wasn't intrinsic to the work. Anyway, I talked to her at some point, and I wasn't convinced she had even read the paper. I think reading, and understanding, a paper should be the bare minimum before you accept being a coauthor on it.\n\nBut I had a friend who was in a similar situation---she did all the work and wrote the paper---and her supervisor told her to put the whole group (which was 20 people or more) as authors, and what's worse, they were in alphabetical order. She was pretty pissed off that after all the work she put into the research, and the paper, there were about a dozen authors on her paper, many of whom she didn't know, who were listed before her.\n\nBut, yes, if you're a professor, you might be writing four of your own papers a year. You might have two PhD students and one honours or masters student, each of whom write one paper a year, so that's 7 papers a year, and you're probably also having a lot of discussions with other members of your research group, so depending on the size of the group and the way authorship is determined in your group, you might be listed as a coauthor on anywhere from another 3-20 papers every year. Even at the lower end of that, that's 10 papers a year in total, so if you've been active for decades, you can easily have 300 papers.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d243nq/when_that_thing_which_was_gonna_be_quick_is_not/ezu58zk/"}, "430": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "cuttingmat", "Date": 1568146062, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you so much for your reply - I\u2019m applying for a PhD in Musicology, and I don\u2019t have anyone to turn to asking about applying for a PhD in Denmark with UK system degrees.

Some have gaps of decades.  The reality is that most academics considering you for a PhD won't have any experience of life outside a university, won't understand it, and won't care either way.  Even the most relevant work would be considered irrelevant - it hasn't been academically assessed and so won't be considered something which they can take into account (even if they wanted to, which they don't).  You can suggest you spent much of that time doing research and prep for your PhD so as to have more time once you commenced and were paying fees etc.  Some people do that.  Something on Github or working on an open source project or similar will count for more than whatever you did for an income.  Lack of that might harm your chances with some departments, it depends on the departmental culture.  \n\nWhat matters in the UK is evidence of interest in your research topic and (more importantly) evidence of your ability to succeed.  Provided you have a first or 2.1 in your Masters, that should be sufficient.  Anything less will require some additional explanation why you've improved since.  \n\nIdentify a potential supervisor on the basis of their research and publications.  Write to them directly explaining what you would like to do for your research project, why, and show how you thought it relevant to their work, then ask if they would be prepared to consider you as a possible PhD student under their supervision.  It's especially easy if you are going to build on their own research directly.   Most will be too busy to take you on, but they'll take you seriously and refer you to someone else who can supervise you, which is all you need.

Essentially you want to use \"cool methods\" without first demonstrating they sit on a solid methodological foundation which makes them reliable.  Why would anyone trust them?  The whole point of doing a PhD is to learn and demonstrate a solid understanding of all the steps required to produce new knowledge.  The first and most important thing is methodology.  If your methodology is flawed, there's no point looking at your findings because they can't be trusted.  So first you always have to prove your methodology is solid.  The first step is to demonstrate you understand the problem/data correctly, then that the methods you use are appropriate and that you have considered and rejected alternatives and have good reasons for doing so.

Do you really want to have a boss that is not interested in supporting you but instead spends considerable energy on keeping you small? Do you want to work in a job that doesn't offer you any further development of your skill set? Choosing a PhD almost by default minimizes the number of jobs to which you suit later on. You should rather use your energy to find companies that really value what a PhD brings to the table. This can be Google or Microsoft.

As far as imposter syndrome goes, mine went away a little bit when I realized everyone else in my cohort felt the same way and we all decided to be friends and get through this thing together. Having a strong social support network is vital, so I recommend making friends within and outside of your program. Additionally, seeing your PhD as a job rather than your entire identity. You are an adult person with a life, your PhD is a part of that (albeit an important part) but it's not your entire life.

I'm able to do all this because my advisor is incredible and stresses the importance of work-life balance, and she models it to us very well also. There are absolutely times when this is not how my life is - before a grant or project is due, qualifying exams, etc are very stressful and I end up living on coffee and takeout while not working out for days - but this is the norm for the majority of grad school for me.\n\nFor example, my typical day involves waking up at 7, making coffee and eating breakfast with my partner, getting to campus around 8, working out at the gym until 9, and then heading into the lab. I complete various tasks through the morning, attend any meetings, then take a half hour break for lunch. More work and meetings in the afternoon, answering emails and other less stressful tasks as well. I usually leave around 5, go home and either go grocery shopping or cook dinner with my partner. Eat dinner, if there are any final emails or tasks (running a script, finalizing a presentation, work on homework, etc) I do those after dinner, and then we spend our evening working on projects related to our various hobbies, or playing video games (or going to hang out with friends.) Once a week I have swing-dancing club, and sometimes in the evenings I will go to the craft center and work on pottery. On the weekends I have a no-email policy unless I know I will have to do some work (for example, sometimes I have to go check on my lab mice on the weekends.) Saturdays/Sundays I usually go hiking, visit the farmer's market, make food, hang out with friends, clean my apartment, do laundry, etc.  \n\nIt's difficult, but not impossible if you make work-life balance a priority!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d3a7nd/is_it_possible_to_be_content_have_a_balanced/f0197sw/"}, "529": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "UsernamesAreHard2684", "Date": 1568312797, "Score": 4, "Body": "It is absolutely possible!

Perhaps due to the reasons mentioned above (which makes every slide like a fresh slide I have to understand, with a limited amount of felt connectedness / predicability). Another possible reason is the heavy use of technical jargo, perhaps sprinkle it with a refresher of what the different technical terms were, and be careful when using a lot of abbreviations of said technical terms.\n\nBest of luck!

I'm a faculty funded, first year PhD in Australia in urban geography, investigating the ongoing transitions Australian cities are experiencing with dockless bikes and scooters and how the various political, social, and economic responses are shaping active travel outcomes around the country, pairing practice theory and urban political ecology with spatial morphology. I'm roughly seven months into my candidature, however I started with a completely different topic and started from scratch at the end of May, and am roughly where I'd want to be by September.\n\n**What  did you do last week? (Brainstorm everything, but especially  congratulate yourself for things that went well, any struggles you  overcome. Recognising when you achieve milestones is important.)**\n\nLast week I came back from bereavement leave (or as close to) and struggled to get back into my research. Having a bit of RA and demonstrator work has helped me keep \"on top\" of things, though my RA role is driving me insane - I will be glad when that contract is up next week. I successfully went to my first therapy session in months though, and that was constructive.\n\n**What does this project need now?**\n\nAt this stage I need to finish drafting my literature review and framework chapters. Having roughly 5000-6000 words drafted of the former would be a good place to end the week.\n\n**Goals for the week:**\n\nMonday:  Today I stuck to my goal of actually getting back into my writing after leave and wrote 1000 words. This was between fielding emails for the aforementioned RA headache\n\nTuesday:  My first priority tomorrow is sending out emails to conference presenters who haven't yet registered as today is the deadline, and reminding authors that there are some scholarship opportunities. Then I need to go through this week's GIS workshop material to make sure the data is still current in preparation for this week's classes. After that it's writing where I'm able.\n\nWednesday:  I'm going to start drafting a conference paper, however this isn't needed until the end of October. Again, I will aim to continue writing.\n\nThursday: If not doing admin, I plan on spending the morning writing as I'm teaching all afternoon.\n\nFriday: I'll likely finish the week with reading a couple of papers that have popped up recently and I haven't had the time or attention to read, and sending through work to my supervisors.\n\n**Distractions/Issues/Focus:**\n\nCurrent issues are getting back into the mindset of writing after taking leave.

I hope that, even if you disagree or feel I'm judging you unfairly, you take a little time to think on what I'm saying and see if anything resonates. \n\n1. In terms of your desk placement: How far are we talking about? Are you having to take a 20 minute walk to your lab? Or is it just a few extra steps?\n\n2. Re: desk swapping: Your colleague was there first, and is in no way obligated to move for you. He has a good point about getting to know others in your cohort\u2014these are the people who will be by your side for the next \\~4 years, and working to get to know them will help you develop an important support system with the people who are going through the same things you are. It sounds like you\u2019ve already disregarded your classmates as not worthy of your time and effort; I would really recommend rethinking this attitude. Making connections and fostering relationships with the people in your field/community is one of the most important parts of the PhD process, and a reputation for being cold, elitist, and arrogant will get you nowhere. You don\u2019t have to be best friends with everyone, but your first impression is probably lacking among the people you should be building connections with.\n\n3. Don\u2019t judge people for being a non-native English speaker. You\u2019re going to have to collaborate on papers and projects with LEP/NNS individuals and yes, it will be frustrating at times. Especially reviewing or writing papers, it's incredibly tedious work. But imagine what it\u2019s like to take on one of the most difficult endeavors of your adult life, where you have to understand complex material and convey your thoughts in a language you aren\u2019t native to. Imagine the pressure you\u2019d feel, how judged you would feel, how much that would shake your confidence. Imagine some new kid coming onto your floor and asking you to move from a place you\u2019ve made your own because he/she doesn\u2019t like their desk\u2014and then that person is not only rude about it, but clearly judges you as inferior/undeserving because you have a different background from them.\n\n4. Re: lab work. It sucks when a situation such as this doesn\u2019t live up to your expectations, but the truth is that a good portion of research involves doing stuff that is unglamorous, unexciting, and sometimes even out of your area of interest. For 4 years I\u2019ve been on a research team that I find utterly boring and, if I\u2019m honest, a bit of a waste of time. It's only tangentially related to my actual research, and I don't think it contributes much to the field at large. But you know what? I\u2019ve got some great lines on my resume from the experience, some collaborations with team members that branched off of the main research and was more suited to my personal interests, I've been able to travel with the project to present at conferences and visit off-site installation spaces, and I now have several publications with my name on it in respected journals. Make the research work for you! The work doesn\u2019t owe you anything\u2014what you think is \u201cexciting\u201d and worthwhile needs to change, at least for now. Figure out what you can get out of the lab and work to make it happen. Focus on the positive.\n\n5. This horrible person you\u2019re talking about in the lab? Get used to it. This is your chance to work on certain skills: developing healthy boundaries, learning how to be diplomatic with your colleagues, and bringing issues to the attention of the appropriate individuals if necessary. I\u2019d also like to say that your experience with this type of person is NOT LIMITED TO STUDENTS. You might (very likely WILL) have to work with professors, post-docs, etc. who are just as bad or worse. I\u2019ve seen colleagues go to extreme lengths to slog through a research project with an advisor who made their life an absolute nightmare\u2014so bad that they ended up filing a 20-page report with HR and quitting with no notice. I\u2019ve seen students admit themselves to the ER because they were having a nervous breakdown from the stress, pressure, and unreasonable demands of their superiors. I\u2019ve seen students refuse to put their names on a publication because the data was presented in a way that was not only amateur and not up to the standards of the field, but actually unethical and manipulated to the point that they did not want to be associated with it. These are extremely unhealthy cases, and I don't wish them on anyone. But dealing with difficult people is a life skill, and you're going to be surrounded by people who you don't like for the rest of your life. Also: you may be that person for someone else. Keep that in mind.\n\n6. I get paid at the end of the month, that\u2019s not unusual. Oh, and my student fees? Yeah, those actually make the first month of every semester UNPAID for me. It sucks, big time. Payroll will fuck up sometimes, and sometimes it will be so bad that it\u2019ll feel criminal. Don\u2019t even get me started on reimbursements, TARs, and Expense Reports. It is a living nightmare, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\n\n7. You say you feel like you\u2019re not making friends, but from your post you honestly seem like someone who is presenting very negative vibes, judging people quickly and unfairly, criticizing things that others have learned to deal with and don\u2019t bother complaining unnecessarily about, and\u2014most importantly\u2014you seems to feel like everyone around you owes you something. I\u2019m not surprised you don\u2019t have many friends yet, and those you do have seem to be giving you good, straight-to-the-point advice, probably about your bad attitude. I would listen to them, even when their advise is hard to hear. The things that are the most painful often get their power from the fact that they are hitting on something real.\n\nI'm sorry that this is so harsh. I'm just telling you, as straightforwardly as possible, how you come across from this post. It\u2019s possible that this program isn\u2019t the right fit for you. It\u2019s possible your expectations are just in need of some realignment. It\u2019s too early to know, either way. Give it a couple more weeks and reassess. But don\u2019t bother unless you\u2019re willing to step back and act with a little humility, compassion, and respect. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in other peoples\u2019 lives, and judging them is unfair and unproductive. You\u2019re doing yourself no favors by approaching this situation so negatively and presenting yourself in the way that you are. Try to get a little perspective. You\u2019re incredibly fortunate and privileged to be able to take on a PhD, and a lot of people don\u2019t even dream of having such an opportunity. It\u2019s hard\u2014incredibly hard\u2014but it\u2019s also an incredible gift to be able to pursue your interests as a career path and become an expert in your area of interest. If you decide it\u2019s not the right path for you (or simply decide to seek a different institution) that\u2019s totally fine! But don\u2019t give up on this yet, and don\u2019t be a jerk.

You can find other gaps if you do the same statistic analysis, if you analyse Caucasian and Chinese people working in the same position, Chinese people tend to win more money. Is it because of a bias? No, because the same studies that use a multivariate analysis of payment suggest that Chinese people in average work more hours and that why they win more. Also, most non scientific studies and some \"scientific\" studies that use one variable in the analysis like gender just sum the total amount of money earned by men and the total amount of money earned by women and then they get to the conclusion that men win more money. This is stupid because again does not consider the amount of working hours, the years of experience and also and more important the career choices. It is quite clear, that even nowadays when in developed countries people are free to choose their career path that women are still going in higher percentage to low income jobs like health and men to high income jobs like engineering", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d50itx/found_this_in_an_interfacial_science_book_really/f0l9724/"}, "788": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SupSquark", "Date": 1568707650, "Score": 0, "Body": "I'm genuinely quite shocked that you are attempting to justify men being paid more than women.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to address the 'women go into lower paying jobs' comment. As was previously mentioned, there is an unconscious bias against women applying for an academic position; naturally one could conclude from this that we are putting more men in higher academic positions because they are far more likely to get the job for having a male name. Women are also discouraged from applying because they are more likely to be affected by imposter syndrome, they are more likely to be told to 'think about having a family' and how that will impact their career, and they are simply belittled/ sick of the connotations of being a women in STEM. Woman are also less likely to ask for a pay rise because their superiors are male and (quoted from Physics Today, see link) 'boys in the department give money to boys in the department' - anon. Which really isn't helped by the fact that 'an assertive man is seen to be showing his self-worth, but an assertive woman is seen as bossy'[sic].\n\nWhat makes is more difficult is that, as I mentioned, women are much less likely to be published than men. The IOP reported last year on a study which saw publications from over a hundred disciplines be inspected and the gender of the last author determined:\n\n\"Of the 115 scientific disciplines examined, 87, including physics, had fewer than 45% female authors. Around 13% of last authors in physics were women\"\n\"The researchers say that as last author is usually associated with seniority, based on this data, their model predicts that it will be 258 years before the gender ratio of senior physicists comes within 5% of parity.\"\n\n(source: https://physicsworld.com/a/gender-gap-in-physics-amongst-highest-in-science/ )\n\nThe same article goes on to say that many scientists are opting to publish only initials, so the stats may not be 100% accurate; this is exactly what I am planning to do in order not to have papers rejected on the basis that I have a vagina. \n\n\nWith regards to the different factors impacting the study: in 2017 Physics Today published a report, conducted in the US, which took into account age, postdoctoral experience and the respective employment sector and found that there was still a 6% discrepancy. Whilst 6% may sound little to you, imagine you're sitting next to a colleague who's earning \u00a350,000, you're both putting in the exact same hours and doing the exact same tasks on a day to day basis but you earn \u00a33000 less because you're a woman. Does that seem at all fair? \u00a33000 is enough for a nice holiday, it's enough to buy a horse, it's enough to cover 3 months of my rent. \n\nAt the University of Missouri, a female astrophysicist compared her salary with that of a male colleague who had started the same time and followed more-or-less the same path as she did. She had one more prizes and become a professor before him, whilst he had more overall publications. Doesn't seem like there should be too much of a gap, right? Wrong. He was earning a whopping 20% more than she was. \n\n\nDon't claim that the pay gap is a myth. Stop being ignorant because it works in your favour and you're not the one who's going to have to fight against it. Stand up for your equally-as-intelligent and equally-as-credible female colleagues. \n\n\nHave a look at these:\nhttp://www.parliament.scot/S5_EconomyJobsFairWork/Inquiries/GPG031-Institute_of_Physics.pdf\nhttps://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3760\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5749692/\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218598", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d50itx/found_this_in_an_interfacial_science_book_really/f0lawm2/"}, "789": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sleepspice", "Date": 1568709422, "Score": 2, "Body": "They\u2019ve been extremely passive aggressive and when they give options and say \u2018it\u2019s up to you\u2019 I know that if I don\u2019t do exactly what they want it\u2019ll be bad or reflected badly on me.

As you correctly stated that position is usually associated with seniority and until quite recently academia was dominated by men so there should be more men in senior position but things are moving forward maybe in some years we will see a higher percentage of women. But again if you have fewer graduates women/men in a field we can not expect it to be equal at the end.\n\nI really think we are not getting my point. Of course, I'm not against equality. I'm in favour of equality of gender, race, religion and sexual orientation, as everyone which is not a moron. I don't know about the whole world but I guess in the developed countries the situation should be similar to my country, where is forbidden by law to pay less to women that are exactly in the same positions (position, years of experiences, working hours, etc) and if you are a victim of such discrimination or know anyone that is victim you should report it. Surprise surprise, the number of such reports it's really small and a lot of them after the investigation is proved to be wrong. The problem with this movement is that nobody gives straight examples that can be analyzed and solved. Most arguments are about the general population and not specific causes which make solving the problem quite impossible. And for that reason, I think these general examples and arguments are not productive.\n\nBut I guess we can agree in something. That historically speaking, there was no better time to be a woman/black/gay (or any of the other minorities) in both days to day life, science or other work. Don't you agree with that? That we moved a long way? Don't you think you have a better life than your grandmother? What do you think about showing some appreciation about the path we have travelled to arrive at this stage?\n\nBut well. It was nice talking to you.

That doesn't mean you're stupid, it just means you're not finished crafting them. For each one of your aims, you should be able to come up with a specific hypothesis or two, and at least one feasible way for testing that hypothesis.

Not every sentence you write has to be the perfect sentence right away. Set up an outline of headings and paragraph contents you want to write (for example as a bullet list), and go from there. Just start writing what you think should go there, worry about references later. The important thing is that you've got some words on the page, and you can go back and edit later, that'll be much easier.\n\nHaving said that, 'just write something' is always easier said than done. What helped me in addition to the advice above is writing with others  (someone's already mentioned Shut Up and Write sessions), or at a location other than work or your home. If you're writing on your own, I've found that Cold Turkey Writer really helps. This will block everything else until you've written a certain number of words or a certain amount of time has passed. It won't let you fiddle around with layouts or anything either.\nI've found this to almost work miracles for me, I've gone from 500 words a day if I was lucky to writing thousands of words per day (with the outline created beforehand).

I feel the annonymity of reddit makes it easier to swallow one's pride and get to the point. It is nice to see that I'm not the only one that feels this.

There some interesting ideas I will use to go forward. Some things, like making a timeline of Draft submissions, having overviews of content requirements and bouncing \"work-in-process\" sections off my supervisors, is currently being done but isn't yielding fast enough progress. I blame it partly on my writing phases which are very irratic, likely due to a badly acquired dependance on stimulation aids (caffeine etc.) which get me off the couch and make me \"inspired\". I see that the shut-up and write (even if it's bad) strategy could be beneficial in overcming \"down\"-days. Currently, I see writing much as a chore that requires a creative mind, which means its tedious and can't be done if the mind isn't with it (and easily put off). Turning it into a planned activity and seeing it as a challenge to putting down words (reward inducing - like completing tasks in the lab which I love) could make a difference. I am considering the change of location, even if it means loosing the secondary screen at home and lugging around my beaten-up laptop. Systemising my content has been very tricky due to the wealth of literature on the topic and working in an interdisciplinary research field (.... anticancer research on a chemical in a plant). I have already listed 120 references in 30 pages and there dozens of more summary documents on each section with relevant content that should be included. With an added need of completing my literature review (experimental is 95% complete) to get to my RnD sections and having been told by my supervisors to \"chose every word carefully\", I am currently trawling the literature and getting stuck on banalities involving sentence structutre... I suppose this is what got me to spill the beans on reddit. \n\nAh... 450 words not written on my thesis...

At first, I was pretty happy with the position and work. I was working on a lot of projects and still continuing to do some research related to my specific interests. As the years progressed though, I noticed two things happening. First, while all of my research colleagues at Academic institutions and other govt labs were getting their funding cut (usually by NSF), due to cut backs in science funding, our lab was actually getting more money due to being under Defense. This made me feel extraordinarily guilty as I felt that my colleagues were doing just as important, if not more important, work. Which leads into the second problem...as the years progressed, more and more of my research and the proposals I was writing needed to have applicable \"Army relevance\".  So instead of working on my actual research areas of interest, I found myself working on random Army projects....which was definitely not rewarding.  I would spend weeks writing a killer science proposal, and get told in two sentences, \"The Army doesn't care about this\".

So 3 hours round trip is not a big deal.\n\nAs for helping a professor move, were you paid for that?  Did you have to do anything dangerous?  If the answer is no to both, I don\u2019t see the issue.  As a doctoral student I rewired our doctoral student lab due to poor cabling.  In a previous life as a reporter, I put in new door locks.

You don\u2019t  get to use it as an excuse to get out of work.

Some places will pay your for the unused days and some places will say use it or lose it.  If a boss fails to give you time off, report them.\n\nAs for the professor lining his pockets, yeah, that\u2019s crazy and stupid.  And if audited he will pay for it.  If there is evidence of wrongdoing, you can report the misconduct.\n\nYelling at people is never good.  But I also don\u2019t know why there was yelling.  I\u2019ve had a TA royally fuck up despite being given a calendar and a slideshow with what to say with notes.

Since then I've been doing my PhD on top of another full time job. I've also noticed difficulty concentrating and getting motivated.

Break everything down in smaller steps (so not just \"write an article\" but, look for literature, read literature, write intro, ...).

I always underestimate the time things take, making me feel guilty when I'm behind my imagined deadline, so calculating a ridiculous amount of time helps.\n* Set very reasonable goals concerning the amount of time you'll work on your PhD on certain days. In my case, all the work for my PhD has to be done after working hours (since I work at my job during working hours). I used to dread setting aside one (weekend) day each week to work on my PhD, since this meant working 6 days out of 7 (for several years).

One of mine did his PhD on a topic which was a minor section of one of my chapters and,of course, he questioned me deeply about it, to the point I just had to say I couldn't answer.

At this stage in the PhD failure is almost unheard of. The only reason people fail at this stage is insufficient preparation. 3-4 weeks is sufficient and average. But that includes weekends and evenings. \n\nBear in mind pass with minor or major revisions is still a pass.

But a few things I've been told are here.\n\n1 - It's very important to think about what is the contribution you expect to make. Why should people care about what you are doing? Aim for that first. \n\n2 - After you made it clear that people should care about what you are doing, you should then think about how you can get evidence that is strong enough. This will depend a lot on the field.\n\nI have neven been given a number, like the three ways you mentioned. It's more like, given the resources and conditions that we have, what are the ways we might do it? Only after thinking about that we will be able to say if we are proposing 1 way, 3 ways, or whatever number you get as a result.\n\n3 - It's good to have a journal in mind when you're that. After all, different journals have different criteria to judge if they should care about what you are doing, and what evidence is strong enough, for example. \n\n4 - About setting a lower/higher bar, I was told a few things.\n\nFirst, it's a trade-off. If you set a lower bar, it's easier to accomplish what you are proposing to do. But, because of that, you need to do an extremely good job. On the other hand, if you set a higher bar, it is going to be harder, but people will be more forgiving, more willing to understand that it's not fair to expect things to go smoothly. \n\nIt's like the scoring system in gymnastics. Maybe you do something perfectly, but it's something that is easy to do. While another person had some flaws, but with something that is extraordinarily hard to do. We see both strategies being used.\n\nSecond, it's easier to lower a bar that was high, than to raise a bar that was low. If you start with a higher bar, often you will be forced to lower it somehow along the way, as you find some problems and obstacles in your research. And then, you can lower the bar, and still be good with it. But if you start with a lower bar, you don't have much room to get lower than that, and raising the bar if you are asked to can be very challenging. \n\nHowever, I don't think there is an easy answer to that. I like setting a higher bar, and my advisor too. But that means I can often try to bite off more than I can chew, and also that a lot of my ideas are shot down because of that. It's still a good way to learn what I am able to do, and what I'm not able to do, but I guess it makes things even harder for me.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/d9z2t2/advice_for_developing_phd_proposal_aims/f1m7qfx/"}, "1359": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SamuraiBrz", "Date": 1569587614, "Score": 2, "Body": "I'm a 3rd-year student, and it's impossible to tell everything that has happened so far.

He didn't tell his supervisors just yet as you probably know they tend to be pretty busy and occupied with other activities. He had a pretty lousy rest of the day after which we went to play squash with a few other fellow PhD's. Well during squash he was still ranting and the rest of us were chiming in with suggestions on how he could best bring up his loss of a years work with his supervisors. We all emphasised tough not te become angry or confrontational when discussing his loss of samples with his supervisors. This will do so much more harm then good. For the research and the supervisor relationship. \n\nHe ended up waiting a couple of days to discuss the mishap; until his next formal supervisor meeting. He told his supervisors what happened and he had done a rough estimation of how long it would take to get new samples and be back on track. His supervisors ended up being very understanding of his situation and emphasised that he made a good impression because he took ownership and responsibility for his research. \n\nIt wasn't his fault the samples got thrown out accidentally. It was his responsibility to get back on track and continue with the research. So I guess it worked out really well for him. He ended up being on track with his research within 6 months or so after the incident. All things considered, he said it was a pain doing everything over but he could do the task faster than before.\n\nIn short:\n1) Step back and be angry and disappointed \n2) Make a plan how to improve after discovering your mistake, use your correct settings and determine how this effected previous results by repeating an earlier experiment with the correct setting. Maybe some of your data can even be saved after corrections are made.\n3) Tell your supervisors in time (this does depend a bit on how your relationship is with them) and take responsibility for your mistake.

But I will tell what I think.\n\nUsually, the only programs that are \"typically on most applicant's radars\" are the famous ones. Every time I see a list of schools that says, Harvard, Stanford, etc., I think that the applicant didn't really do a good job at selecting schools. \n\nYou gotta look for programs that are really a good match for you, especially taking into consideration your research interests. When you do that, programs that are under the radar will come up naturally. It's not normal to have a topic that is only researched by the top 20 programs, while being ignored by other programs. \n\nAnd when you do that, you can even find that some of those \"under the radar\" are actually stronger for that topic than places like Stanford. Or course Stanford is great, but that doesn't mean it tries to be the best for every topic in Consumer Behavior research.\n\nSo, finding a good match is more important than ranking. \n\nAbout \"great, passionate academic staff\", I think this is pretty much the standard in CB. They are usually passionate about what they do, otherwise they probably wouldn't survive for long in this field. \n\nAbout \"some funding\", at least in the US funding shouldn't be too much of a concern. Any PhD program in Marketing that is worth the name should be able to provide a full tuition waiver, a stipend that is relatively good (at least when compared with PhDs in most other fields), and resources for your research. You'd need to look for some really shady programs to not get funding.\n\nAbout \"interested in an untraditional applicant / have admitted older applicants\". I'm 46 years old, and I was also worried about being considered too old. But now, I don't think age by itself is a problem. Age is usually related with other issues. For example, you will need to have a good, convincing explanation for your plan to leave your current job. Also, an older applicant with a lot of experience in the industry will probably have a managerial perspective for marketing. So, for a field like CB, which is very focused on strong theory, they may be worried about whether you will be able to adjust accordingly. \n\nLoving research and dreaming of being a professor are almost a given. Almost every applicant will say the same thing. Now, if you really love research what evidence do you have for that? Do you have academic papers, have you presented research somewhere, have you worked as RA for a professor? With evidence, it gets a lot easier to believe that you really love research. A very young applicant may have their age as an excuse since a young applicant didn't have much time to do something. But an older applicant had time to do something, if that applicant really love research.\n\nSo, the problem is not being untraditional. The problem is, regardless of being untraditional or not, can you provide evidence to show that they should get you into their program? I don't see much from what you wrote. Age is not evidence of that. A masters by itself is not evidence either (but maybe during your masters you got papers, presentations, RA experience, etc.). A high marketing position certainly isn't evidence of that. \n\nAlso, it may be good to remember that many applicants in CB are not necessarily strong in Marketing, but in fields like Psychology. You may be great in Marketing, but still struggle a lot with all the Psychology you need.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dazt4d/any_under_the_radar_marketing_phd_programs/f1ww477/"}, "1486": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lgleather", "Date": 1569791539, "Score": 0, "Body": "What\u2019s your definition of low funding?\n\nCan\u2019t pay for class?

When I was doing ecology, I had a couple of field weeks each year where I'd (gladly) pull 60-80 hour weeks. However, during the semester I maybe worked 20-30 hours per week at most. I still wrote five papers in two years as a Master's student. So, the work is getting done. That being said, when I switched into lab-based stuff, that work took more time on a consistent basis throughout the week. You're a Ph. D. student and should be able to move your project in a direction with a workload you can handle.\n\n2) It depends on what your other school commitments are. I have always been at research-intensive institutions with VERY little class time required. I also do not consider class and teaching time to count towards my \"PhD hours\". I understand some people have a lot of classes that take a lot of time. You could potentially mitigate this by not going to schools with those expectations. \n\n3) It depends what you consider \"work\". If you're running an experiment but only have to check on it once or twice an hour, for eight hours, have you really worked eight hours? Most people I know would agree that their \"40 hour week\" has a lot of downtime, seminars, lunches, and literally watching Youtube in the lab. \n\n4) Numerous studies of white-collar jobs have shown that productivity flatlines at about 40 hours (but going over once in a while does add productivity). If you are regularly working 60 hour weeks maybe you should check in with yourself and see if you're actually getting more work done. Your particular example sounds like you're talking more about a \"deadline\" situation which is fine.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/db8fsb/oh_welll/f228enm/"}, "1570": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ducbo", "Date": 1569884156, "Score": 1, "Body": "Just came here to say your schedule sounds both productive and healthy!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/db7x00/goals_for_the_week_30th_sept_6th_oct_2019/f228jmf/"}, "1571": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ducbo", "Date": 1569884499, "Score": 3, "Body": "This is a great idea, thanks for putting it up!\n\n**What did you do last week?
