But if it is, the second marker's opinion will be essential for this.\n\nYou need to sit down and create a battle plan because the odds are not in your favour. \n\nFirst, find out what the appeal procedure is in your institution. That will give you an idea of what you can use as an argument for a better mark. \n\nSecond, speak to an academic tutor you can trust if you have one. Do not speak to them if you suspect them to gossip about you. If your supervisor finds out about this, they will want to avoid damage to their career that is inevitable if bias on their part is documented. \n\nThird, speak to support services in the student's union, they are on your side and might have dealt with this in the past. \n\nApart from that, have your recommendation letters in order. Do not ask her for a recommendation letter. Just go to the lecturers that you clicked with and where you had the best marks (compared to other students). But you should be aware that academia is small and people depend on each other. If you want to succeed in the same field as your supervisor, you will now have someone who does not want to work with you.\n\nGood luck.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7bmca3/help_my_professor_sabotaged_me/dpj3qc5/"}, "52": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ExsquiteInformation", "Date": 1510161849, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you so much for this advice, you have really given me hope that I can do something.

This serves not just as an assessment of the student, but in a way as an \"out\" for the University.

I was asked to derive first-principles equations on the board on the fly from memory...it sucked. I eeked out a passing grade.

There's basically 4 ways to get out of paying tuition. Here it is ordered according to preference:\n\n\n* 1) Get a fellowship that pays for tuition and gets you a stipend (ex. [fulbright](http://www.scholars4dev.com/2876/usa-fulbright-scholarships-for-international-students/) ). These are rare and very competitive. Check your country's fellowship programs as well, they may require you to come back immediately after graduation however (for example [DaaD](https://www.daad.org/en/study-research-in-the-usa/)). This is the most preferable option.\n\n* 2) Get a research assistant-ship (RA) with a Professor. You will have to email Professor's that work in your field. Set up an interview and they may chose to fund you through an RA. Remember that this funding is through their projects and may not extend until you finish your PhD. Your Professor may be able to win another grant and continue funding you, or you may have to find a TA after your RA gets over (or pay your tuition yourself). You're basically under the mercy of your Professor, he/she can fire you at any time, and you have to perform research that supports the project you're being paid from. Still it's preferable since your funding directly complements your future dissertation. Additionally, you may be funded full time or half time. Half time gives you half the stipend and covers half the tuition. You may be able to get a half time RA and a half time TA (see next) to completely fund your PhD.\n\n* 3) Get a teaching assistant-ship (TA). You can apply to be a TA through your department after getting accepted to a US academic institution. A TA may have to teach a class, teach a lab, perform grading, take remedial classes, etc. TA's are very competitive but your Professor may recommend your candidature to give you a bump (this is mostly done through unofficial channels, like a private email to the grad chair). The good thing is that this funding is through the department so you may be able to follow your own research goals (instead of it being dictated by the project as in an RA and your adviser). However, your adviser may arm twist you into following whatever research goals are of interest to him/her. The bad news is that you have to spend a considerable amount of time preparing, teaching, grading etc, this is time taken away from your research. And believe me when I tell you, undergrad students are a HANDFUL. You may be a half time TA or a full time TA (depending on how much funding your department has). Remember that the department wants to save these positions for their senior PhD students to push them out.\n\n* 4) Get a graduate assistantship (GA). This is basically some sort of work available through certain channels in your university (almost definitely outside your department). This varies a lot, and I can't quite describe it well. A good example is paid position through the University Graduate Student professional associations. The good news is that the funding mechanisms is the same as RA and TA, and your adviser will probably have no control over it, which means you can do whatever the hell you want during your PhD. The bad news is that your responsibilities will be so outside your PhD expertise that it may distract you from your PhD. However, that may not be a bug, instead a feature in your case, if those responsibilities help bolster your CV. However, these positions are very rare and very competitive. Please note, these are very different from paid hourly positions. Paid hourly position (such as working on campus, or at the cafeteria) does not come with tuition or health insurance benefits. They basically only pay you by the hour and provide no other benefits. Also, when in the US on an F-1 student visa, you CAN NOT work outside the academic campus (no independent consulting services, tutoring services, domestic services etc.) your pay check HAS to come from the university, and you CAN NOT work more than 20 hours a week (on paper) except under certain circumstances. You will be in violation of your student visa.\n\n\n\nEven with all these funding mechanisms, they only cover your tuition and probably your health insurance. You will still have to pay University fees (stupid scammy fees like sports fees). Expect your school fees to be around $500-$1000 per semester if you're funded full time. Expect your stipend to be around $500 - 1000 /month if you're half time funded, or about $1200 - $1800 /month if you're full time funded. Also, one final addition, your funding will most probably only cover fall and spring semesters. There's a very good chance you wont find any sort of funding for the summer semester (good time to go home!), so get an apartment lease accordingly.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7clxrd/getting_a_stem_phd_abroad/dq5fqg1/"}, "234": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "idothingsheren", "Date": 1511303726, "Score": 1, "Body": "My TA evaluations :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7bh2zi/graduate_student_researchers_what_decorations_do/dq5vnwx/"}, "235": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Thorngs", "Date": 1511306525, "Score": 2, "Body": "This is very nice to read.

When writing a review it\u2019s difficult to keep a track of all the articles you have read. It is helpful to create research evidence tables. You may have already heard about this. If yes then this would be just repetition. It always helps to create a excel spreadsheet where you divide your research in two or more sections. The main section where you find articles  relevant to your research. I suggest you catalogue articles  year wise and then briefly touch about their methods and results . Add a small note in your own words about the pros and cons about each article. If you find articles that are not relevant but are related to your research in some other aspect , I would suggest you list them in a separate sheet and write a few points about why In your opinion this article is useful for your  research . This way when you finally write an article you can rely on the notes on the spreadsheet  and  put the pieces together.

Basically, the postdoc does not have to be in exactly the topic what you're doing right now. Mostly, research groups ask their postdocs to come up.with new ideas and expand the group's expertise.

To explain my situation shortly, my supervisors always pushed me to handle the data in ways that I know were unethical. A few months before the end of my PhD, I discovered that one of my supervisors had made a huge mistake handling the data, meaning that all my analyses had to be rerun. After everything they had put me through before, this was the point were I couldn't take it anymore. I stayed at home with a burnout for a month (which wasn't enough tbh). I knew I hadn't been feeling well for years, but when I finally stayed home I started to feel really bad (a lot of physical complaints, anxiety attacks etc). Btw, I'm a psychology grad student, so I really feel what you're saying about the irony of not being able to help yourself.\n\nLuckily, this was also a turning point for me. I found another (part-time) job as a researcher outside of academia. I now work at a university college (not sure whether this is a 'correct' translation, it's a bit hard to understand how our national system compares to others) which is less academic and more practice-based. I do miss being able to do more experimental work, but this job has given me so many things that I've missed during my PhD. I'm also still trying to finish my PhD part-time, but with the stark contrast with my other job, the academic environment disgusts me more and more.\n\nThe advice I would give you is: you do you. You say you're stubborn. I relate to that. My boyfriend has been telling me for years that I should quit my PhD and I would just get mad 'cause 'he doesn't understand what it means to me'. The more and more people gave me advice, the more insecure I got about what to do. What helped for me was to get some other things to focus on (like the other job), get some distance. Maybe it will work for you as well? Ask yourself why you really want to finish this PhD? I still haven't resolved whether I want to finish, but I do feel a lot better having other things to focus on.

My arthritis and skin disease also came out of remission, but this was more manageable. In addition i discovered I had previously gotten by on being smart versus being a \u2018good student\u2019,  Meaning I was completely unprepared for managing the requirements of such a rigorous program at full health let alone working around debilitating migraines. Couple that with my dad having passed the year before, a medication triggering what I now realize were manic episodes, and an anxiety disorder with panic attacks, my mental health deteriorated completely, and I slid into a depression. I stopped sleeping for days at a time, stopped caring for myself (think hygiene etc) or my living space, and would call my mom sobbing regularly because I would sit down to write a paper and literally be unable to write a single sentence. I failed two classes my second semester (C), and almost failed two others.  And because I expected my professors to treat me like a malfunctioning robot instead of a human being, I didn\u2019t say a word to anyone until after my grades started rolling in. In my program, three C\u2019s gets you kicked out. \n\nThe way I describe that time now is I was in near constant pain, and was completely out of my god damn mind.\n\nAs soon as I finished my short summer semester, I traveled back to where the doctors who\u2019d originally helped me with my headaches were located. Obviously after meeting with them they identified all the other issues I listed above (and here I thought the problem was just headaches and a poor work ethic!).  I enrolled in some serious therapy along with the medical interventions, and before I knew it, my program was two weeks away from starting. \n\nI panicked. I realized I was in no way ready to go back yet. I had just begun to make progress in treatment, and knew I still wasn\u2019t myself. Getting into this kind of program had been my goal since I was eight years old. Eighteen years later my dream was a reality and i knew I was inches from throwing it all away. What would people think?  Would they let me take time off?  How could I make sure I was physically and mentally ready to return?  How could I return with all my classmates and professors knowing I\u2019d failed?  How could I go back now knowing I\u2019d been acting like a crazy person for months (like asking nonsense questions in class etc/wearing the same dirty clothes to all that weeks classes)? I felt so ashamed. \n\nSo I applied for a medical leave of absence. Which was terrifying in its own right because I did not want to have to tell my University the details behind why I needed the time off. Thankfully they aren\u2019t allowed to ask, but I didn\u2019t know that initially.  Anyway, making that decision was awful, and those who disagreed certainly didn\u2019t.  \n\nOur situations are different for many reasons, while health triggered the problems, by the time I sought help the issue was far more mental than physical.  My only goal (well obviously other than improving my own well being) was getting myself to a place where I could return to my program successfully. In the end four of us from my cohort had to take leaves of absence for various reasons, I was the only one who returned. And I\u2019ve been kicking ass at the program ever since, even though this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life. I still get migraines, I spent six months depressed without realizing it again, but I took the time off that I needed to be able to handle my program and my life. \n\nYour health is your first priority. If this is your dream, it\u2019ll still be there when your ready for it.  And if you can\u2019t meet the requirements due to your health, you\u2019ll find another way. When I got arthritis I was a ten year old competitive swimmer with dreams of the olympics (so unrealistic lol but it was my goal), and was suddenly told that I would never be able to swim without pain again (I lost complete use of my left shoulder/arm bc of the pain). So I found different ways to be in the water, and am still so grateful my arthritis went into remission after ten long years of literally constant, sometimes excruciating pain.  \n\nWe don\u2019t get to choose the things that happen to us health wise (for the most part). I am so sorry you have to go through this. And again, while our circumstances are vastly different regarding severity, I say with confidence that the person you will be on the other side of all this will be stronger than who you are today in ways no one can predict. We don\u2019t grow when things are all sunshine and rainbows, it takes a storm. I wish you didn\u2019t have to go through such a tempest, but I wish you the best. \n\nI keep a quote on my door, I read it every day as I leave the house, good ole Winston Churchill, \u201csuccess is just going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm.\u201d ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7gfo3s/how_not_to_feel_guilty_about_leaving_a_phd_mainly/dqjrt9z/"}, "321": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "spookylake", "Date": 1512039481, "Score": 2, "Body": "I think you should get out and don't feel bad about it!
