Thankfully I pushed ahead with publications starting a few years ago so I'm not without pubs, just lacking depth and strength in my dissertation.\n\nI have actually been thinking, if I ever do become a tenured professor I'm going to try and start reforms to draw power away from the advisor. A few of my current ideas are\n\n1) get all students in a yearly cohort together regularly to discuss research goals and lab practices, and even have structured discussions about topics like ethics, authorship, etc. This way if someone's advisor is weird the student has some perspective and, bonus, students can't be forcibly isolated if they have to attend meetings.\n\n2) change the advisor-student dynamic into more of a committee-student dynamic. This also encourages the student to mature to an independent researcher faster since they have to balance committee members who probably have different opinions.\n\n3) regular meetings with dept head or perhaps an appointed professor-as-dept-ombudsman just to discuss directions and perspective.\n\n4) required training for all advisors. I'm talking minimal training that they don't even have now, like an hour a week for two months when they start, and then distribute literature.

From my experience, interactions with a professor might be wildly different between undergraduate classes and research work during a PhD. One of my professors was really bad at giving undergraduate classes, mostly unprepared and sometimes incoherent, but then I had an internship in his lab and the experience was completely different. He took the time to explain the subject in his office and was very clear and helpful. Some professors are just bad at giving lectures but are great scientists. \n\nOf course YMMV, each professor is different, but if you can have an insight from their graduate students it can help a lot. A great professor might make a 7/10 subject turn into something great and a bad professor will make a 9/10 subject hell on earth.\n\nYou also mentioned that one of the professors has lots of connections, this can be really important depending on your career goals. My advisor is very well known, and liked, in our field and it opened a lot of doors for me. It could also lead to a co-direction with another scientist in the field which could compensate for some of the shortcomings of your original advisor. \n\nThe most important thing is that you need to picture yourself during the toughest times, when you feel nothing works and your research seems to be going nowhere. It may be hard to picture right now, but trust me it will happen. Will the subject matter more than the advisor or vice versa? If you are very independent and resourceful you could power through it without a great professor, but an awful advisor could potentially make it worse. I know a couple of brilliant students who struggle to complete their PhD, even though they love their research subject, because their professor is a total shithead. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, money is also important of course, but you should apply for scholarships even if you already have funding from your advisor. The thing with funding is that the more you recieve the more you will get. And this will follow you after you complete your PhD, especially if you work in academia. When you will apply for your first research grants, they will most likely look if you have already received scholarships and you'll get bonus points for that. For me this is a shitty part of research, running after scholarships and grant money, but it is part of the game and you need to get some experience with that. Of course it will be different if you plan a career in the private sector, but it always looks good on a resume.

I\u2019m abd in political science (admittedly very different from your work). I read your whole post and I remember feeling exactly the same way, and often still do. It was massively overwhelming, I never felt like I was doing enough or knew enough or had the right background, and was/am constantly afraid of losing advisors\u2019 respect. And what\u2019s more, I didn\u2019t realize how much this would affect my relationship. I found myself giving less and less attention to my partner, and feel alienated because I couldn\u2019t really talk to them. \n\nI promise you that this is very very normal, in every single field, and especially in your first year. There are some folks who come in with amazing experience, some who seem to be on a different level, but I assure you that  the vast majority of us feel inadequate, overworked, and fragile. And even for those who look like they have it all together (some of my friends think I\u2019m one of those), it certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way to them. I know you\u2019ll probably (like me) say that \u2018no, it\u2019s different, I really don\u2019t know, and I really am getting sidelined\u2019. That may be true, but its also very likely that you seem more competent than you think. \n\nSome things that help: \nfriends and safe spaces! Some PhD friends will just want to talk work: you don\u2019t need them. But find those ones who want to have a beer, existentially complain, and support each other\u2019s difficulties. I promise they are out there. \nWorkshops! For me it was a rewarding experience to be part of student-run workshops (if relevant for your field) where I felt comfortable saying \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 or just asking questions. \nTherapy! Therapy and counseling is extremely common in graduate school, and your school medical offices should provide it free or cheap. Myself and almost all of my friends have been talking to therapist for a good portion of the last few years. \n\nFor many people this is the hardest year of their life. At the time I felt like I was being broken down so that I could be built back up, and I tried to take a \u2018what doesn\u2019t kill me makes me stronger\u2019 attitude. Regardless, the first year can feel emotionally traumatic. \n\nA short (and true) story may be illustrative. Once in our department I was talking with some friends about feeling inadequate and like an imposter. My friend asked a young professor who had recently been tenured about when it goes away, and he laughed and said he still has it. He knocked on another professor\u2019s door, who has been tenured in the department for a few decades and is reaching retirement. \u2018When does the imposter syndrome go away?\u2019 The younger professor asked. The older one responded: \u2018what do you mean? It never does.\u2019 \n\nIt may never go away, but it\u2019s also a matter of perspective. I\u2019ll end with a quote from David Foster Wallace that I always found helpful (the relevant bit will be obvious): \u201cIf you worship money and things \u2014 if they are where you tap real meaning in life \u2014 then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It\u2019s the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already \u2014 it\u2019s been codified as myths, proverbs, clich\u00e9s, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power \u2014 you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart \u2014 you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.\u201d\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7j2xp9/first_year_phd_on_a_rollercoaster_of_emotions/dr3bi9r/"}, "80": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Monoclewinsky", "Date": 1513036792, "Score": 1, "Body": "First, you have to believe at some level that you belong there- you were accepted to 2 PhD programs, so you have the qualifications.

The algorithm is not widely used as of yet, it's adoption is still limited but increasing as the scientific community become more aware of its existence. \n\nI should have made it clear in my OP.  Ultimately I would like to land a position in industry but many of the jobs I am interested in require a PhD.  I thought that by capitalising on the research I have already done I would be able to reduce the time it would take me to attain a PhD.  I would like to think the quality of the research is at the standard of a PhD and would like some type of formal accreditation for it. \n\nThanks for your input :)  ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7my4gi/can_i_convert_my_research_project_into_a_phd/dry8906/"}, "156": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nevk_david", "Date": 1514644118, "Score": 1, "Body": "In the Netherlands it is absolutely possible, and I guess in other European countries as well. \n\nThe requirement will often be that prior work fits in the whole thesis, or the other way around, that you find 2-3 more substantial projects that can be logically linked with your current work to make up your final thesis. Of course there needs to be money and interest for this. \n\nI want to encourage you to do it. It will be rewarding and as you have shown that you are able to finish a project this is a fair predictor of finishing your PhD thesis successfully. \n\nTalk to your supervisor!

They should be very experienced in such matters. I would think being your supervisor's first PhD is a huge red flag too; at my uni they need to have been involved as secondary supervisors so they can get experience before they're allowed to be a primary. Perhaps, if you need to talk to them directly, you could cite their lack of familiarity/interest in your research topic as the primary reason, and the lack of supervision experience as a further reason if that's not enough. But hopefully your head of program will be about to help you figure out the best way to do it.\n\nGood on you for advocating for yourself and looking to make this change! It seems as PhD candidates we're often told to just be grateful for what we've got, but working for better when it's an option is the only way to maximise what you can achieve during your program and, accordingly, your opportunities afterwards.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7mfzue/changing_supervisor/ds0mxjo/"}}
