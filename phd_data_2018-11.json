However, depending on what you do, it can be difficult landing those in your first semester of a PhD.\n\nOther options I've seen is people doing private tutoring for high school students.

After watching Joe Rogan and Co. talk about their Sober October challenge (see Sober October on YouTube), I got an idea. The premise behind Sober October was to be sober, but also to work out. They used an app with a heart rate monitor that shared their daily workout scores with each other, which gave them a good quantified competition. They all ended up exercising very hard for the whole month. So, I asked my lab mates if they would like to do something similar with Pomodoros (more commonly time blocking with  25 on/5 off). We use The Forest app, which lets us shared our results. I can say it has been very motivating and helpful seeing the others in my lab (sitting right next to me) working and trying to beat my score each day. I've also found time blocking helpful for focus in the past.\n\nA few other suggestions (all relating to focus at different levels):\n1) Have a to-do list with specific tasks. The more specific and bite size, the better.\n2) Use some type of Pomodoro app, put white noise on, and focus for blocks of time.\n3) Set some small things to cross off your to do list each day...don't let them all slide each day. This will make you feel more productive (you crossed three things off your list - even if they were small) and free up your mind from feeling overwhelmed by an always growing list.\n4) Don't spend all day anxious over how much you'll accomplish that day.

I'm not really qualified to comment on that however...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilarities with your SO:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong ass overdue PhD student. Still working on draft. Was with my girlfriend for around 8 years before she gave up all hope I'd ever finish it and eventually ended things... \"inelegantly\" (\\_spoiler\\_). I would get frustrated and defensive whenever \"progress\" was enquired about. In large part, she supported me financially; not entirely but she contributed far more than I did or could (but when I could I did). I would basically stay up all night, most nights (I'm ADHD and the medications make sleep... troublesome).    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, while this is mostly focused on what your SO might be thinking and feeling, it is in no ways trying to lessen or delegitimize your thoughts or feelings. It is absolutely hard on you too. But you asked for insights from a PhD student's perspective...  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat it was like for me / How your SO might be feeling:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I'm projecting my own experiences and feelings onto him, but it sounds like there's sufficient similarities that there is a good chance of a good deal of overlap...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly the truly foolish or the truly gifted (or both) go into a PhD expecting it to not be quite as bad as all the horror stories they hear about. For the vast majority of those who attempt one, PhD's are hard; far harder than even the worst case scenario you imagined when you started. The truth is, unless you have gone through one yourself, its almost impossible to know quite what its like. It's all consuming and can be soul destroying. You're either working on it, trying to work on it, trying to try to work on it, having time off from working on it (during which you'll either feel guilty about not working on it and/or undeserving of the time off given how little tangible progress you've made recently), or of course, essentially catatonic from the stress, anxiety and depression that eventually sinks in given long enough; staring into space, hoping for that one great insight that will suddenly make everything fall into place... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk. I could easily write a dozen essays about this but I'm tired. So I'll skip towards the advice section as quickly as I can. Your SO is probably feeling incredibly lonely and isolated, stressed and depressed, overwhelmed yet incapacitated, as well as frustrated, emascualted, impotent, and like a big dissapointment; not just to you but to himself and everyone that cares about him. It probably tears him up inside that the one and only thing he can do to rectify the situation he is in and return the love and support that you and others have given him, is the one thing that he seems to be so incapable of doing. He is probably trying his hardest, but he is most likely absolutely burnt out and so exhausted, sleep deprived, and delerious that he can't even think straight. All he wants to do is fall asleep with you, and be a normal person. He does not want for himself or for you what he has gotten himself into - he curses himself for being such a fool as to ever have started it in the first place - but at the same time, the only way out that he can see is to finish it as soon as he can so that you both can get on with your lives and he can then finally make things up to you like he so desperately wants to do, and which you deserve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf he gets defensive when you ask how he is progressing, its likely because he knows that despite him sacrificing everything, it is hard to show that he is making tangible progress (even if he has been, in terms of figuring some things out at least). His PhD has consumed virtually his entire waking life, and when he is with you and you ask him about it (as is reasonable for you to do so), he gets upset; not at you but at \"it\", because \"it\" cannot give him even a moments peace. He knows things are not good between you, but the only way to fix things is to push himself even harder because, for all he knows, maybe tomorrow is the day you finally get fed up and break up with him, but if he can just get something finished if he stays up all night then maybe that will help things...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy advice (which I suspect will sound unfair on you given you're already supporting him): start by telling him that you know he is trying his hardest but also that he is exhausted, therefore this weekend you are both going to have fun together and forget about this stupid thesis thing for a change. Go out for a meal, have a few drinks, and why not a comedy club; I'm sure you could both do with a laugh. Or do something you both used to enjoy doing together. Be intimate, have sex, sleep in. Binge watch cheesy but funny movies or tv shows while eating ice-cream, pause for sex as often as you can. Reconnect. Don't pressure him to talk about \"it\", but maybe towards the end of the weekend if things have gone well, tell him that you're in this together and that you want to help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen. Don't judge. Don't just listen but engage with what he is saying. You don't have to understand every little technical thing he is saying, but try and see if you can get him to explain what he is doing in the broader context of the thesis as a whole. If he is struggling as much as it sounds like, the last \"helpful\" thing he will want to hear is about timelines, deadlines, or gantt charts. Yes, a PhD requires some project management skills, but he might just really appreciate an opportunity to try to explain to someone he cares about what he is trying to do, who is listening in a non-judgemental way, or even just to have someone say they understand what he is going through (even if you don't/can't fully). As I said, this advice might sound unfair on you, and I won't lie, it is unfair on you. You're already supporting him financially, with such little to show for your concern in return, yet I'm advising you to splurge on him (and on your relationship)...?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not fair. Why should you have to sacrifice so much, just because you are in a relationship with someone who is trying, yet seemingly failing, to do something that is really really hard? That's not a rhetorical question by the way. Maybe there's nothing left to salvage, but maybe there is...  Surely after all this time, you owe it to yourself/selves to take one weekend off to try and remember and possibly rekindle what it is that drew you to each other in the first place, before the bullshit asshole phd nightmare took hold of things...  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really need to sleep now, but feel free to ask me any further questions.
