It\u2019s great that you\u2019re thinking ahead regarding how your diagnosis might impact your PhD.\n\nTo answer your question: I personally have no regrets about doing a PhD. I have one in Experimental Psychology, and it was the best time of my life so far.\n\nRegarding the general context of PhDs, and your situation: Be mindful that this is a really challenging thing to do, both mentally and emotionally. Mental health issues are more common in PhD students than in the general population, and I believe at least part of that is because of the job demands. You\u2019re highly independent, it can be difficult to know what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, your work is difficult, and others will seem to be doing much better (\u201cimposter syndrome\u201d). Be sure to ask for help if you need it: from your supervisor, from postdocs in your lab, and also from the other PhD students. It\u2019s super important to realise you\u2019re not alone in this, and to reach out in time.\n\nAs for ADHD and medication: Focussing on your topic and not saying \u2018yes!\u2019 to side-projects is very important. Also be mindful that you\u2019ll have to sit and stare at a computer screen for days on end. (Being medicated might actually help you do that, btw! Methylphenidate is supposed to help you stay focussed, as you\u2019re no doubt aware of.) I don\u2019t think your condition is going to prevent you from being able to successfully complete your programme, though. But again: Being aware of your shortcomings, working around them, and also asking for help when you need it is crucial.\n\n**TL;DR** No regrets at all for my PhD in Experimental Psychology. PhD students are more likely to face mental health issues: Be aware of the early signs, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for advice and help from your peers, postdocs, and supervisor. ADHD and your medication aren\u2019t likely to prevent you from completing a PhD, but be mindful of how much time you\u2019ll be spending on sitting behind a computer (writing, thinking, analysing, etc.)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/8ocl8o/regrets_or_no/e037lyt/"}, "95": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Stargazerlily425", "Date": 1528122482, "Score": 2, "Body": "I'm starting my PhD in counseling and counselor education in August.

Here are thing to keep in mind and advice\n\n1) Re: the top comment, directors of grad programs don\u2019t make the admissions decision, faculty do. It\u2019s our grants that fund you, and we\u2019re responsible for training you. That\u2019s why we ultimately decide if we want to work with you, if we do, we admit you. \n\n2) Saying you graduated from \u201ca top law school\u201d isn\u2019t relevant. That\u2019s like telling a mechanic that you want to work on cars because you\u2019re a \u201cdamn good woodworker.\u201d Some skills MAY, transfer over, but you\u2019re also deep in a way of thinking that might be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Some faculty would see you as more work because they might need to train out bad habits. (Whether or not this makes any sense, some faculty will still believe it.)\n\n2) Your BA will hurt you. If you have a double major or minor in bio, that might help. \n\n3) Your application will head straight for the middle/bottom unless you\u2019ve already made a connection with a faculty member. Remember, faculty don\u2019t want someone interesting, they want someone who can help them do work. If you have to play catch-up you won\u2019t be able to help right away. This will annoy everyone. \n\nWhich brings me to advice. \n\n4) Try to get outside funding through NSF or another org. If the program/faculty doesn\u2019t have to pay for all of you it\u2019ll help. Plus, doing so would show that you\u2019re both serious and competitive. \n\n5) The farther along you are into being a lawyer, the more work you\u2019ll have to do to prove that you\u2019re serious about making the change. \n\n6) Find a program you like and email a faculty member. Don\u2019t email an assistant prof, email an associate or full. They will have been around longer and will be more candid. Tell them your story and ask them for advice. \n\n7) If they send you signals that you won\u2019t be competitive take them seriously. Every year there\u2019s a student who didn\u2019t take hint, applied anyway, and has zero chance. That\u2019s a waste of money and time. \n\n8) GREs aren\u2019t as important as they used to be, but you\u2019ll need to ace the math section. Why? Because folks will assume you don\u2019t know math, and this will be the only formal way to prove otherwise. \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of.

That's not to say that your relationship can't change, but it sounds unlikely that he will ever be a mentor or supporter.

Don't try to follow an arbitrary, simplistic rule in all situations. It's like saying \"should I always use the singular or always use the plural?\" It's technically possible to do it, but you can't just throw out an entire chunk of English grammar and expect to write well.\n\nWhat happened is that there used to be, at some point in the 20th century, a notion that academic prose should always avoid referring to the authors with first\\-person pronouns. For example, instead of (1), the community preferred (2):\n\n1. \"We measured the expression of transcript XYZ by qPCR\"\n2. \"The expression of transcript XYZ was measured by qPCR\"\n\nBut tastes have changed, and now the community prefers (1) instead of (2). (2) uses the passive voice to avoid saying *we*, so some people got the idea that they should reverse their previous habit by never using the passive voice for any reason at all. It's a common situation in English grammar: because there's no Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola to tell everyone what's good or bad English, there's a trend, then someone complains about it and starts a countertrend, and normal people who aren't interested in the details try to boil it down to a simple rule, which gets garbled and misunderstood and overapplied.\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of people who complain about the passive voice don't actually know what it is (few native English speakers know grammar terminology for their own language) and are complaining about something else. The linguist Geoffrey Pullum has a long list of examples in [this article describing how confused English speakers are about the passive voice](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/passive_loathing.html). (Or see [this shorter article by Steven Pinker](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/passive-resistance/380787/) for a simple explanation.)\n\nSo, use both voices. Because version (1) above is currently preferred, good academic writing uses the active voice most of the time, but not always. Choose the grammatical subject of your sentence for the sake of clarity, not for the sake of a misunderstood and unhelpful rule. Ask someone to proofread your work and they'll tell you if you have a habit of overusing one voice or the other, but in 2018 most people don't.

Though it is difficult to judge how much he actually yells at you and berates you inappropriately, and how much is due to actual hardships of research which are a part of all or most PhD studies, and how much may be due to your sensitive, pessimistic, self\\-deprecating nature which people often develop in their 20s also without doing a PhD.\n\nI am in a similar situation in the aspect that I am one of the first two PhD students, years after a few PhD students left early in my supervisor's tenure track, because of whom he also didn't want to take any more PhD students... until I needed and wanted a PhD spot (I have worked with him since my undergrad). And I am quite consistently performing well below his expectations in my PhD research so far (I will be 3 years into my PhD in October, no journal publications from PhD).\n\nAt first, he harshly criticized my (lack of) research at every opportunity and yelled at me at least every couple of months, and I felt terrible about it and about myself because of it. But he didn't kick me out and he provided me enough directions for me to do enough research to not get kicked out by the committee. So I didn't really confront him until well into my 2nd year, when my co\\-students (notably better at research than me) approached me with their fears of him and dissatisfaction about his yelling, angry emails, berating and expecting perfection. Then I sent him an angry email... to which he responded by urgently coming to my office and being very nice and very open to honest conversation and suggestions for improvement of his behavior and supervision. So I told him. Among other things, that he needs to accept that no\\-one is perfect and that we would appreciate that he communicates with us nicely, calmly, in normal voice, because his yelling scared and demotivated us. He listened, and he indeed worked hard to improve himself. He fulfilled my co\\-students' demands/wishes as soon and as much as possible, none of us left, and I haven't been yelled at or excessively harshly berated by him ever since (for more than a year by now), and to my knowledge neither has anyone else \\- and some of us (especially myself) deserved much more of that in this year than in the year before. Of course, he still points out to us our many mistakes in writing, research and whatever, and we are grateful for that because that's how we learn and improve our work (though we get annoyed when he points out tiny imperfections). He is well\\-liked by everyone in the group now, I think he is \"growing up\" into a great supervisor and I am proud of him and feeling lucky that I am still his student. (Though there have been many reasons which aren't his fault because of which I am still not succeeding, or I am also too critical of myself and just taking a less usual kind of PhD route.)\n\nKnowing my supervisor for such a long time (more than 5 years in total), I have some insights into causes of his difficulties with PhD students. All his life he's been struggling with perfectionism, anxiety issues, low self\\-esteem, and difficulties with social skills. And his first/main PhD supervisor had much worse behavior issues and mistreated and traumatized him, so he didn't have enough of a role model how to do better. But he is a genuinely nice person and wants to treat us well and help us not only succeed but also be happy and healthy.

Instead, ask questions such as \"are the labs mostly composed of PhD students or post-docs?\" \"what student-run professional organizations are there?\" \"how many years and how many publications does it take for the typical PhD student to graduate from your program?\"", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/8ldmw8/helpful_phd_interview_tips_bioscience/e11tay5/"}, "507": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "followthedata", "Date": 1529591708, "Score": 1, "Body": "Your thesis sounds amazing, best of luck to you!\n\n\nI sure do!

So make sure you ask concrete things like \"I noticed you work under professor X.  I am interested in his research and considering applying.

(in person/video chat is the best because they don't always tell you things but you can see them squirm if you ask about a pain point.).  Also grad students get busy so don't take it personal if someone doesn't answer, just send out another email and avoid spamming entire labs or groups.\n\nAlso just look at the academic jobs available based on the qualifications you will get.

IF they do allude to earlier events in the myth (e.g Philomela\u2019s rape at the hand of a family member, and her subsequent revenge upon this man) then they mention the rape and ignore the retribution part of the myth. The inverse is true on the Jacobean stage. \n\nAfter Milton, the nightingale becomes a more complex character to refer to, and Philomela and Ovid are often ignored by male poets - they refer instead to a nightingale that serves as a metaphor for the poet, as a result of the complex music that both poet and bird are able to produce.\n\nMy argument:\n\nFemale poets reject the \u2018typical\u2019 representations of Philomela used by their contemporaries. Women in the earlier half of the period (c. 1600 - 1700) will often create a female friend for Philomela (to emphasise the importance of female communities and peer support for women) or allude to Philomela\u2019s revenge. I argue that Ovid\u2019s narrative is of greater importance to women, as opposed to men, as they identify with Philomela to a far greater extent; female speech was interpreted as inherently sexual, and the publication of female authored poetry seems to have sometimes been equated with a sexual transgression. A sexually violated figure, such as Philomela, therefore, becomes a pertinent parallel for these earlier female poets. \n\nAlso, Milton\u2019s alterations to the literary nightingale tradition are rarely adopted by women before 1790, and the \u2018Philomela nightingale\u2019 remains a relevant figure right up until almost the very end of the time period I am examining.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/8sruah/what_are_you_getting_your_phd_in/e193n6d/"}, "1023": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1529923258, "Score": 4, "Body": "I actually really disagree with the advice that the topic doesn\u2019t matter.

I was wondering how you guys found your PhD programs. So far I\u2019ve been google searching for programs and topics, and more recently started looking at the authors of articles I\u2019m interested in. I have an excel sheet of possible mentors. I\u2019m having trouble finding people that do specifically what I want though. I\u2019m currently in a master\u2019s program working in community psychology on topics surrounding homelessness and mental health, but for my PhD I\u2019d really like to work on how trauma at a young age is related to the onset of schizophrenia.\n\nYou're already employing great strategies here, to the extent that you've got such a well-defined topic that you're hunting for the \"perfect\" mentor.  But this person doesn't exist.  It's ok though, the PhD process itself is very malleable, and you can \"interpolate\" between what mentors exist and what their (funded!) research topics are, and what it is specifically you want to do (as you have very well-defined it).\n\nWho is the closest match so far?\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t have any neuroscience or biology experience though. Most of my research experience has been qualitative. Do you guys have any suggestions?? Thanks!\n\nThis aspect, your \"qualifications\", are to a large extent up to you and your potential mentor/advisor/PI(principle investigator).
