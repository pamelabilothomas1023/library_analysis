I had a very prestigious government fellowship, I was publishing good research, professors viewed me as an \"ideal PhD student,\" and my advisors were fantastic. But I felt dead inside every time I stepped into lab. First of all, it is so common to doubt the value of your PhD at year 2 (one PhD blog refers to this time as the \"Valley of Shit\"). That said, this is a sign that you need to take charge of your life. While it is a super lonely to feel this way, the good news is that you don\u2019t have to rush making any life altering decisions until you\u2019re ready. \n\nExplore your options. The best thing I ever did was conduct informational interviews. Ask family and friends to connect you with people in your field. Meet with career services and have them connect you to alumni who you think may or may not do interesting things. Connect with people on Linked In, etc. Also, attend professional meetups and talk to professors (especially ones with experience in both industry and academia). There are so many alternative career paths besides academic research for PhDs. But you may need to be a bit clever to enter these alternative career paths (it\u2019s good to start acquiring relevant skills now). In addition, there are so many career paths for people with a Masters. Figure out what inspires you and what genuinely makes you feel alive and go from there. \n\nQuitting is not failing. Going through life on autopilot in order to live up to other people\u2019s definition of success is a failure. There is a HUGE world beyond academia. I ultimately decided to leave with my masters and was surprised at how much employers did not care that I quit PhD. Just be able to articulate why you decided to change career paths and always be positive. Also, many employers value research skills and the ability to tackle ambiguous problems. Family and friends were not always supportive of my decision at first, but if they care about you they will ultimately support you. \n\nThen again, you may decide that PhD is the correct decision for you (perhaps changing your project or even labs will inspire you enough to want to continue). If you do stay, you should have a clear vision as to why you are pursuing this path. Whichever path you do choose, explore and reflect often. Life does not have to be linear and there is no \u201cright answer.\u201d The world is fascinating and life is way too short to be depressed, uninspired, and jaded.

Is Ph.D. a good investment for me?  \n     The PhD is never a good investment from a monetary point of view if you are planning on going into the private sector or public sector job (in the non educational sense).  If you want to teach at a university then yes, PhD all the way (more on this at #3).  However, if you love the area of research and you want to complete a program with the highest degree possible because you want to expand an area of knowledge, then by all means YES!  \n\n2.  Are there chances for me to get a full funded program with those GPA?\n     Most universities that provide a PhD program provide assistance with the program.  Usually in the form of a stipend and tuition waiver.  However, they require that you do something along the following lines:  teach class(es), professor research, etc.  I've seen some STEM PhD students get in the 15-17k a year stipend with tuition waived.  Also, keep in mind that some PhD programs also have research tanks giving away scholarships and money to graduate students in their area of research.\n\n3.  Which university or state .... ?\n     If you want to teach at a top tier school, then you must (usually) graduate from a similar ranking school in order to do that.  Not always the case, but most of the time this is the unofficial consensus.  If you want some advice, the adviser makes or breaks a PhD student.  School X doesn't really matter if you find a well respected adviser in the area you want to study.  That being said, please keep in mind the first thought on this question.  School matters when it comes to teaching at a university of similar or higher ranking.\n\n4.  Any other suggestions...?\n     Yes, if you are thinking about a PhD program, you need to learn to love learning.  You need to learn to be completely solo (on your learning) and you need to learn to love to read.  If you can't sit down and read about which schools provide the best programs in your research area and search for what programs are similar to your interests, etc.  It might not be the best approach for you.  Although, there are many non-dissertation research that is usually conducted in groups, the majority of your time as a PhD student will be spent scrounging the material for anything related to your interest area.\n\nGood luck.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_45x9vt.json"}, "59": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "fjanko", "Date": 1455665164, "Score": 1, "Body": "why?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_44w093.json"}, "60": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Milpat", "Date": 1455666852, "Score": 1, "Body": "The PhD in History blurb was a joke.

Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry\u2014a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth\u2019s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion.\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; . \n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; [FREE..

Now, in his hilarious and heartfelt new novel, he envisions a deliciously dark tale of America\u2019s dysfunctional coming years\u2014and the timeless and tender feelings that just might bring us back from the brink.In a very near future\u2014oh, let\u2019s say next Tuesday\u2014a functionally illiterate America is about to collapse. But don\u2019t that tell that to poor Lenny Abramov, the thirty-nine-year-old son of an angry Russian immigrant janitor, proud author of what may well be the world\u2019s last diary, and less-proud owner of a bald spot shaped like the great state of Ohio. Despite his job at an outfit called Post-Human Services, which attempts to provide immortality for its super-rich clientele, death is clearly stalking this cholesterol-rich morsel of a man. And why shouldn\u2019t it? Lenny\u2019s from a different century\u2014he totally loves books (or \u201cprinted, bound media artifacts,\u201d as they\u2019re now known), even though most of his peers find them smelly and annoying. But even more than books, Lenny loves Eunice Park, an impossibly cute and impossibly cruel twenty-four-year-old Korean American woman who just graduated from Elderbird College with a major in Images and a minor in Assertiveness.After meeting Lenny on an extended Roman holiday, blistering Eunice puts that Assertiveness minor to work, teaching our \u201cancient dork\u201d effective new ways to brush his teeth and making him buy a cottony nonflammable wardrobe. But America proves less flame-resistant than Lenny\u2019s new threads. The country is crushed by a credit crisis, riots break out in New York\u2019s Central Park, the city\u2019s streets are lined with National Guard tanks on every corner, the dollar is so over, and our patient Chinese creditors may just be ready to foreclose on the whole mess. Undeterred, Lenny vows to love both Eunice and his homeland. He\u2019s going to convince his fickle new love that in a time without standards or stability, in a world where single people can determine a dating prospect\u2019s \u201chotness\u201d and \u201csustainability\u201d with the click of a button, in a society where the privileged may live forever but the unfortunate will die all too soon, there is still value in being a real human being.Wildly funny, rich, and humane, Super Sad True Love Story is a knockout novel by a young master, a book in which falling in love just may redeem a planet falling apart.\u00a0\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; . \n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; .\n\n&gt; [[BOOK]...

My undergraduate degree was in computer engineering, but I had always regretted not studying my true passion - geoscience.  I knew, like you, that it would be very difficult to get into a respected program with such a large gap in my academic studies...and applying for a program unrelated to my undergraduate degree.  My approach was multifaceted.\n\nFirst, I began taking as many classes as I could at local community colleges in geology and geophysics to establish a refreshed base of the geosciences.  (I did take a few geology courses as an undergrad, but like I said, 8 years prior). I also retook some differential equations courses to refresh those skills as well.  I did this for about a year, and then studied like mad for the GRE.  I actually had a killer GRE score from my undergrad days, but it had expired!  Doh!.  I studied and took practice exams for a solid 3 weeks and ended up doing very well on the exam.  This definitely helped my case.  Lastly, I was very proactive about contacting potential future advisors.  I tried to expression my passion an avidity for the discipline I wanted to study, and that though various life experiences I came to realize what my passions were.  I talked a lot about how my current situation felt very much like a \"dilbert\" job, sitting in a cubicle, and I longed to do field work in the sciences.  In the end, I had very positive interactions with many universities, but only applied to 3 (I was only applying for a masters at the time).  Even with all this said, and with a lot of luck...I was still only accepted at one school (which thankfully happened to be my first choice of the three).  I was worried about my recommendations as well, and ended up using one of the professors from the community college, a co-worker (who could speak to my work ethic), and my current boss (At the time, I told him I was applying to an on-line program at the university, and not a full-time one).  I remember when I met with the graduate chair, I asked her what was it about my application that got me accepted?  This was a very-respected program that had over 300 applicants, and only accepted 20.  She told me, \"I was very moved by your personal statement essay on your application\".  Seriously.  It helps to write a well-thought-out personal statement.\n\nAfter being accepted, I figured the MS would be a good litmus test to see if I was PhD material.  After 2.5 years and a Masters working with my fantastic advisor, I asked if I could stay on to do a PhD and he approved it.  In all, it took me almost 8 years to get through it all and I didn't actually start my post-doc until I was 38 years old.  It's been a very long road, but I am SO glad I took it.  I've spent over 2 years of those 8 doing field work and lab work.  It has been so worth it.  Hope that helps\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_484kek.json"}, "100": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lakewoodhiker", "Date": 1456778003, "Score": 1, "Body": "I wrote a response to a similar posting a few months ago that basically sums up my thoughts (although this posting was more related to getting through motivational slumps). In your case, it may be more of figuring out just what your passion is.  Are you still passionate about the work you're doing if there was no timeline, and you got to just play in the lab doing the research. Here was my comment:\n************\nI would add a couple of motivational things... I just finished up late last year and walked in May. I went through all of the same stages and emotional slumps described here...especially the imposter syndrome. Despite obvious progress I was making in the lab, and in discussions with my advisor or committee, I wasn't publishing so felt like nothing was actually getting done. (My university requires 3 publishable chapters...although at least 4 is recommended, but they don't have to be published to graduate). Anyhoo. After finishing my Candidacy and Comprehensive exams, I no longer had any palpable milestones to shoot for other than graduation. I was another ABD, and defending seemed so far away. Don't despair though...There were two things that did it for me:\nI went to a graduation and watched my girlfriend (wife now) walk and be addressed as \"Doctor\" for the first time about a year before my defense. I was obviously super happy for her, but I also sat there almost in tears. I knew where I was with my work and watching her walk was an incredible motivator. I sat there and told myself, \"I want that\", I want to be walking across that stage just like her. I want to be called Doctor\". Later that night I recorded a video on my phone of myself saying something like \"you saw her walk today, and you know how bad you want that. Stop fucking around, and get your damn work done\". I watched that video anytime I was slacking off or procrastinating. It worked surprisingly well.\nThe second thing that did it for me was actually setting my defense date. As soon as my committee agreed on a date (about 3 and half months out), it was if I went into robot mode. I had a necessary milestone, a date. For three months I barely slept, I wrote like a muthafucka, and I sent drafts back and forth with my advisor incessantly. I survived on ramen, coffee, and fruit loops, but I made it happen. Nothing else mattered for those three months and I thankfully had a very understanding partner (who knew exactly what I was going through...from personal experience). The final few months leading up to your defense will absolutely suck. There is no other way to say it. BUT....BUT....when you have that robe on and you walk across that stage....nothing feels like it in the world. Nothing.\nI forgot to add, as far as \"losing that part of you\", don't worry to much about that. You'll always have the memories and the experience, and something will get settled post graduation. Whether it be a post-doc, or industry job, or tenure track faculty position, you'll figure something out and you'll be surprised at how excited you are about starting the next chapter.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_46vvok.json"}}
