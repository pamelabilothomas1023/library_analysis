In your field of CS/AI/EE/Stats, 95% of your time is going to be spent not developing new algorithms, but reading papers (many many papers) and building storylines that connects your research with other research in your field.  Is this what you want to do?

Repeat with a different topic.  How's it going?\n\nIf this is the right direction for you, my advice is to read 500 papers before applying to a PhD program.  This experience will help you narrow down your exact area of interest, give you the necessary background to be productive immediately, and make you an attractive candidate for the top effective professors in your field (there's alot of incompetant professors in academia, who target less qualified applicants as students, and you are trying to avoid ending up with one as your advisor).\n\nYou can definitely email professors (or any researchers) whose work interests you.

From my experience (which by no means is universal) academic degrees from any part of the world that is considered a third world country, are looked down and considered inferior. It's very sad.

I can help you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*What field?*\n\nThe field you are heading towards is Natural Language Processing, or NLP.  This field generally uses machine learning and other algorithms to extract knowledge and patterns out of natural text.  Alternatively, if you want to study language (such as your house/houses/stately/states example) by developing intuitively-sensible explanations rather than statistically-predictive methods, this is the field of Linguistics (in Humanities or Arts-and-Sciences).  If you want to focus on investigating the algorithms themselves, that is Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of Computer Science.  If you want to figure out if your experiment numbers mean anything, or are just random noise, this is Statistics.  In university organization, NLP is usually hosted by Computer Science or Linguistics departments.\n\nTo grad-study any of these fields, your activities will consist of reading lots of papers in the field, and then writing/publishing your own.  So, before you start thinking grad school, you should start reading papers.  This will also help you figure out which field you want.  My general recommendation is to read 500 papers before deciding where to apply for a PhD.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Paper Sources*\n\nThe [ACL Anthology](https://aclweb.org/anthology/) is the most relevant source of NLP papers, and freely available.  I recommend this first, after you read any necessary textbooks.\n\n[AAAI Digital Library](http://www.aaai.org/Library/library.php) has a mix of NLP and other AI papers, freely available.\n\n[IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) has a mix of NLP and other CS-topic papers but only shows title and abstract unless you buy membership.\n\n[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is a good tool to search everywhere at once.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Your Plans*\n\n&gt; I'm 48\n\nThis won't be a problem.  NLP and related fields are not taught in high school, so people typically don't discover them until later in life, and older students are not uncommon.  \n\n&gt; Does it make sense to build some more experience in the text analytics\n\nAs long as you've found a subfield with papers you love to read, and are ready/able to be writing your own similar papers, then you have enough experience.  From looking at your slides, it looks like you might have fun and get a basic linguistics education by reading some introductory linguistics material (textbooks).  You'll probably also want to read up on things like basic statistics, experiment design, common evaluation metrics, and other topics that won't be mentioned in research papers.\n\n&gt; then go for a PhD in Computer Science\n\nDoes a PhD get you where you want to go?  Are you sure you need a PhD to get there?  In the US, if you are a competant coder in python/java/etc, a CS PhD will take 5+ years of your life and be very stressful (check out all the depressed/anxiety/suicidal posts over at r/GradSchool).  \n\nTo state the obvious, these days, NLP/ML/CS degrees are worth little more than the experience/ability behind them, which is different than most other degrees.  You'll lose money on it from the lost income.  If you need one, though, that's fine; for some paths they are necessities.\n\n&gt; PhD in Computer Science looking at the global implications of text analytics and factoring in regional idiosyncrasies in semantic analysis\n\nYou could probably do this.  (Of course, these topics are too broad and you will have to be more specific.)  You will need to find a professor who does something similar and who has the authority to supervise you.\n\n&gt; I'd probably try for a government or private grant to survive in addition to savings\n\nNLP and related fields are well-funded, which means any school worth attending will pay all your tuition/fees plus ~$14,000 to $30,000/yr stipend.  If you obtain external funding, like a fellowship or your own grant, this will give you additional flexibility on where you can study, but probably won't increase your take-home pay.\n\n&gt; maybe pick up some ad-hoc hourly work here and there\n\nYour funding contract may prohibit this.  People do it anyways.  Just FYI.\n\n&gt; Will I have fun?\n\nOops, didn't you ask that?  Oh well.  The answer is, generally not.  You'll get to think about lots of super awesome ideas and patterns and linguistic use and rules and algorithms, and you'll have awesome discussions with other people about these things, but you'll generally be miserable trying to shape up your experiments into publishable papers before deadlines, and you'll have to cut all sorts of corners in your work (ignoring alternative hypotheses, using badly-fitting algorithms, pretending bad data is good data) to stay academically competitive and make progress towards your degree.  Publishing deadlines, and efforts to twist unpublishable data until it is publishable, will consume most of your energy.  However, if you have a greater use for the experience or the certification for after you finish, then you may find it worthwhile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Your Slides*\n\nSlide 3: False review detection, sentiment analysis, spam detection (and other document classification), email categorization, thread reconstruction, authorship identification, and text-based forensics, among others, are all subfields of NLP.\n\nSlide 5: house/houses/stately/states: this is the realm of Linguistics.  They find this interesting, and develop typologies to describe these lexical differences.  Same for synonymy.  \nStopword lists: This is mostly a NLP tool.\n\nSlide 10: This list covers an enormous variety of downstream tasks.  These tasks can all be approached from an NLP angle, from a Statistics angle, or from a simple rule-based get-the-system-running-quick angle.  They don't automatically require NLP or semantic knowledge.\n\nSlide 11: Building semantic taxonomies.  There is a whole lot of existing research in this domain.  Keywords: information extraction, lexical resources, ontologies, ontology population.  It sounds nice at first glance, but there some pretty deeply entrenched problems like \"how to disambiguate between multiple senses of the same word\" and \"how can we make the ontology big enough that it's actually useful.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHope this was helpful.

It took my bloody ages. I applied straight after my BSc, didnt get a place- did a MSc instead. applied to a load of places after that, still no where. applied for jobs after that. Ended up working as a research assistant in the department for a year at a place I had an interest in possibly doing a PhD, applied there among other places... didn't get in, and finally after another year of research assistant work, I got a place.  \n\nNow, this isn't because I'm underqualified. I went to a very good university, and had loads of good experience when I applied the first time around, but...so does everyone else applied for PhDs. Also, I'm not from the UK I'm an international student so I had extra difficulties getting funding- however all my education to date has been here, so I was keen to stay here for my PhD.  To be honest, the work and experience I gathered in my 'break' as a research assistant has made my life as a PhD so much easier, i've found working on one task rather than multiple ones pretty chill; and compared to my peers, the rest of us who worked for a few years before PhDs are generally coping better. So, don't sweat it if you have to take some time out, work, get familiar with a department and so on- it may help you in the long run.
