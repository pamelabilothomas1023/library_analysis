For non-academic prospects, many of the innovations in renewable energy/high efficiency technologies are being made by the U.S. private sector and are gaining a lot of economic momentum - this will be affected less by the current political agenda than public scientific funding. So I think many private-sector jobs in this category will continue to be generated, and the prospects are probably still better in the U.S. than any other country in the world. However, you need to make a smart decision on this and decide for yourself which renewable energy technologies will become more viable and expand over the next 50 years. For instance, it really seems like corn ethanol can never meet a large fraction of our demands, and that it has its own severe negative consequences on the environment. A lot of Ph.D. students did research on this in the late 90s/early 2000s, and I can imagine a lot of them (or all of them) had to transition into something else. Another example is hydrogen fuel cells (which are still being promoted by some car manufacturers, like Toyota) which are inherently disadvantaged to battery powered cars like the ones Tesla is making (it's hard to see how these disadvantages could ever be overcome once you consider all factors). If you specialized in some dying or gimmicky technology, you'd have much fewer job prospects post-Ph.D no matter where you are.\n\nThe academic job market started becoming much more competitive in the U.S. from ~1995-2010, and nowadays we are at the point where literally hundreds of Ph.D. holders are applying for new tenure track faculty openings (professor positions). So if you absolutely want to be a professor, you need to be extremely competitive, which can involve surrendering yourself almost entirely to your research topic - this is a sacrifice that many don't want, or aren't able, to make. However, contrary to what others on here seem to be implying, this problem with getting a faculty job is not necessarily specific to the U.S.. It is simply that too many people are getting doctorates nowadays and there just aren't enough academic positions to hire all of these people. University labs are modeled/funded in a way to support one PI and then an army of Ph.D. students, which is simply not sustainable and needs to change. Besides this, I have personally found that 'research-focused professors' in other first world countries still get paid less and receive much less funding than academic researchers here in the U.S, with few exceptions, particularly for science and engineering. I see a lot of research grants in other countries ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, and here in the U.S., major grants usually provide 100s of thousands to millions of dollars of funding. While this large gap is starting to shrink, it likely won't shrink considerably or disappear in the next decade or two.\n\nI think perhaps the worst prospects moving forward in the U.S. are in non-university governmental agency positions. People are still going to college, and at the very least we still need lecturers, but the general populace has been convinced that most governmental regulatory/scientific agencies (like the USDA, EPA, DoE) are bloated, inefficient wastes of resources. And while one side of the political spectrum is advocating for their elimination or reduction, the other side has not been equally vocal about expanding these agencies or creating new ones - so best case scenario is that they stay the same and don't contract in funding. Even during the Obama-era, which supplied many new multi-million dollar climate change or renewable energy research grants to  U.S. DoE national laboratories, it was very hard to get a staff scientist Ph.D.-level job at these institutions. I can't imaging how difficult it will be in the next few years, or even in a Democrat controlled country without Obama-level funding.\n\nFinally, even if you think the U.S. is going in the wrong direction/backtracking on renewable energy, top-tier U.S. institutions are still generally held in much higher regard than programs in other countries, so you can always get your degree at a top institution in the U.S. and then make plans to work in another country afterwards.\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6f3ba0.json"}, "45": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "chef_baboon", "Date": 1496564831, "Score": 2, "Body": "Well what exactly are your concerns?

Sometimes there's a specific post-compulsory version of a PGCE, called a PCET, but this is usually seen as a lesser qualification (and I say this as someone who has a PCET).\n\nIn theory, a master's-level qualification like an MPhil is also perfectly fine to teach undergraduates, and indeed, a few of my colleagues, hired in a different era, don't have a doctorate.  That said, universities simply won't hire lecturers without a PhD any more; I've not seen someone without one hired in well over a decade at my institution.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6ewjl5.json"}, "48": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "grrlinterrupted", "Date": 1496588996, "Score": 1, "Body": "I think it's more which country you're in - here in the UK they've been cutting funding for the research councils which fund PhD projects for years, sadly.

But if they're looking for a PhD student to do it completely, then you may need to write a proposal to show your understanding.\n2.

It doesn't need to be super specifically aimed at them, but I would look into their related areas of research and make a point of how the research you're proposing would help them.\n3.

Some people get positions because they need a PhD student for something, some people get positions because they want to do a PhD and so someone finds them a topic, and then there's those like me who propose their own research.\n4. If you've done your Masters in Physics I'm sure you'll have enough knowledge about the field. The first part of researching is reading, reading, reading, and that's when you get specific knowledge.

As you said, the Canadian offer seems to be better in this respect. Also, the calmer the environment, the better it is for your PhD. You'll have enough distractions anyways. \n\n- Speaking about distractions, don't forget to consider the \"whole package\", not just the research-related aspects of the offers. Some doctoral programs require you to teach, some will allow you to supervise Bachelors or even Masters students. As important as teaching is for academia as a whole, it's a lot of additional work which is not directly helpful for your research. On the other hand, delegating bits of your own work to students is a great research tool\u2014if you're a good manager.  \n\n- Distance to friends and family doesn't matter that much.

I don't think there is a \"correct\" answer, so here is my opinion (I'm a 3rd yr PhD student):\n\nFirst and foremost for a PhD is the research group and adviser, which ultimately plays the most significant role for your research, right from finding a good topic, putting together a good committee, to \"little\" things like going to the top conferences. That said, it seems this point is moot for you, because both the research groups are similar. \n\nSo moving on to the university, it is my opinion that you should go to the better university, and by better, I mean richer. Why? Because there's a lot of support structures that your university can provide you with. The most basic of them is having a great library that subscribes to all the journals that you would need. In addition, better universities have better labs and equipment, as well as money to fund new purchases (if you need them, of course). My university has an excellent teaching center that helped prepare me to TA/teach (and also plenty of opportunities to TA/teach), as well as a writing support system to improve academic writing. All this costs money, of course, and only a \"fancier\" university can afford it. Finally, if a university is better known, chances are, professors there will have more collaborations, and that should be music to a PhD student's ears (this also depends on the professor though). So consider these support structures while choosing where to go. In addition, you may also want to look into differences between university policies on a PhD - the difference between American and European PhDs is well-known (in terms of required coursework, breadth of research, etc.), but I'm not familiar with the Canadian system. \n\nOn the point of a stipend, this is strictly my personal opinion, but I believe every PhD student should be financially struggling to an extent - if you're financially very comfortable, you tend to treat the PhD like a \"real job\" and become complacent, eventually delaying your defense. A PhD is not a \"real job\" - it is a step towards one, and should be treated as such. A little financial fire on your behind keeps you going. That said, if you're paid so little that you can barely afford food, then that's an obvious no-no. Again, this is my personal opinion. \n\nFinally, on Montreal being more relaxed. This is really subjective and depends on what sort of person you are. I mostly immerse myself in my work and go several days without talking to people at all (helps to live in the middle of nowhere), but not everybody likes that. So for me, Montreal or London would be the same (!) because I wouldn't care about the city very much, except maybe the weather. But a lot of my friends keep wanting to do fun stuff every weekend and have to drive to bigger cities, which can suck. Either way, you'll eventually have to balance your work with the \"real world\" and come to some sort of equilibrium.

I restrict and determine the amount of slides beforehand to, say, 6 slides for 10 minutes, excluding title slide and acknowledgements/questions slide. Secondly, I do not necessarily present everything I feel there is to say about a topic or study, but select the most appealing story line through intro/materials &amp;methods/results/discussion/conclusions.

Surely, I may expect a bit more questions than I would have received when having gone over time, but there is one more thing up my sleeve.

I'll add a few points along the same lines. \n\n1) Don't try to memorize your talk word for word. A lot of the stress comes from trying to anticipate exactly what you're supposed to say next, and what you may have missed. \n\n2) Break up your presentation into blocks of points you'd like to get across. It's easier to remember themes (that can be triggered by visual cues) than entire paragraphs of information. The most famous speakers use this technique (this is how some people tend to be able to talk for hours - it's not memorization, it's simply remembering themes). \n\n3) Try to structure your presentation as a story that develops as you're going along, with a clear introduction, climax, and conclusion. Also, whenever possible use short stories as examples throughout your presentation. Stories are easier to remember (both for you, and the listener) and relate to.\n\n4) Use visual aids whenever possible, but make sure it doesn't distract from your presentation. If someone has to listen to you and read full blocks of text on a slide at the same time, you're going to lose them. \n\n5) Practice the speech out loud at least 3 times in its entirety, and time yourself. I've given a 7 hour talk, but first spent a whole week practicing every day before that. By the time I was presenting, I already had 30 hours of experience giving the talk :). Made it a much more relaxed experience.\n\n6) This one is going to sound silly. Right before the talk, find a private room where no-one can hear you, and scream as loud as you can while pounding your chest. If it helps, say words of affirmation like \"I am Doctor Extra_Cellular, and I will wow you with my knowledge of cells!!\" I know a few speakers that do this, and I've used this technique to pump myself up before a big talk or meeting. It helps get the blood flowing, and makes you feel a bit more confident right away. \n\nThere's plenty of other things you can do to lose the nerves, but this is a good start.

So, probably the first few questions would be like \"Why do you want to go for a PhD?\", \"Why did you choose this field/topic/university/country?\" etc. Mostly, trying to see if you are doing it only because you couldn't find another job. If that is so, it will be a deal breaker as motivation is a huge factor to go for a PhD.\n\nAfter these \"knowing your intentions\" questions, they will probably get to asking about your past experience (if any) in the field, like internships, projects, or even MOOCs now a days.\n\nFor me, the presentation part came right here.

I'm based on the campus where my boyfriend is finishing off his double degree, and where he's considering pursuing his own PhD. My secondary supervisor is here, my primary is about a 5 hour drive away (which is actually a short distance in Aus..). So far things have been going okay, but my primary supervisor has been big-time pressuring me to move cities. He doesn't seem to take \"I have a house and a partner here\" as a good enough excuse to not move. He has offered me lecturing opportunities if I did move, but I have tutoring opportunities here that are earning me almost as much money. \n\nI'm terrified that he'll give me an ultimatum some day - move, or don't do a PhD. But, like you, I feel like my life comes first and my work's just there to support it. I care a lot about what I'm researching, but I could do it with another supervisor. My secondary is better at the stuff I'm working on anyway. So really, if the ultimatum comes, I'd pick my partner and I'd find myself someone new to work with, regardless of any delays it might incur. As a side note, with my partner finishing up university soon, he also has emphasized that he'd pick life with me over any job. So it goes both ways, which is super important in my opinion.\n\nAlso, I think the comment about greater focus is a red flag. I know that when I was applying for a PhD, people seemed a little put off by my \"in a relationship\" status. I'm not sure if it was because I'm a girl or whether it happens to everyone, but I found it frustrating. Everyone I know through my PhD still seem surprised and occasionally concerned when I mention my boyfriend. It's like researchers are expected to be single and alone... no wonder so many of us struggle.\n\nTL;DR, I think you've got your priorities right and the most important thing is talking it through with your partner to make sure you both have those same priorities.
