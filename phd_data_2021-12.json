It's understandable to be anxious -- in fact, I don't know a PhD that isn't under some degree of mental stress more than the average person. It's just that we don't talk about it near enough. \n\nSecond, how do you organize your weeks? If you spend the whole week trying to write, you probably aren't going to get a lot done and feel overwhelmed in the process. You've probably been told this -- and I used to roll my eyes at it -- but treating the writing process like a job is actually very helpful. Work 2-6 hours a day, M-F (or something similar). Take meaningful coffee and lunch breaks. This can feel very routine and boring at first, but if you break it down over a month, you'll realize how much you got done.\n\nSet a realistic goal for writing each day. For me, it was 1-2 pages (approx 500 words). It was manageable, and easy to do without losing focus. This took about 3 hours and I'd spend the next few hours on research, grading, or reading.\n\nA productivity hack that I used was the pomodoro method, which helped me organize my writing. I would write for 25 minutes (free-style), take a five minute break, and then revise for another twenty five. \n\nOn that note, journal your progress. Even if it just a few point form notes about what you did.

However, after some time (I'll keep it short) I started struggling with self esteem, motivation and impostore syndrome. I was working on the project completely alone and got to a point where I started feeling depressed, maybe also because of the combined factors of adjusting to a new country and the lockdown. Point is I realized there are so many aspects I don't like about academia and to continue would mean to push my mental health to the limit.

But I also feel blackmailed somehow: the only way I can leave on good terms and with my self esteem and dignity half-intact is if I get something published, which means working on this without any income and while trying to figure out what I will do next in my life.

It is important, especially for wet lab research. Believe me, I had to work in one lab from 80s here, and it was awful. Be sure if you can do a virtual tour or visit on-cite. Now, the lab itself: my advice - do not go to old, \"big\" PIs. So far, most of the sad cases are happening there (I had experienced that too: I and 2 more people quit after one year being in the lab, where PI is super famous, but not nice).

The big problem is that the salary is \\~1200\u00a3/month\\* as a full time student (i.e. no taxes and no benefits) and usually you scholarship won't cover the entire duration of your studies (I was funded for 3.5 years, but the duration of a PhD is 4 years, plus some waiting times) and if you live in London the financial struggle is going to be very real (in other parts of the country it wasn't great, but it was definitely better). I would also not recommend, however the UK has some very well known universities and some very big professors, so there might be some trade-off there for some people. Oh and you might have to teach, but you might be paid extra for teaching. Depends on funding and institution.\n\n\\*as of spring 2020, the amount is updated yearly\n\nFinally I have experienced the Danish system a little bit: the pay is good (employed, not studentship, I think), however the time allocated seems shorter (three years) and you have to spend a certain amount of time in a ~~foreign country~~ another research group (few ~~months~~ weeks), which feels a little rushed to me, but it seems to work ok for most people. Also the working environment in Denmark is quite good, there is certainly lot of attention to work-life balance (although you always get the slave-master supervisor  here and there) and the welfare system is very good (support for children etc.). Although they seem to teach quite a lot.\n\nEDIT: corrected some imprecise or wrong info", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/r7qujc/phd_conditions_in_europe/hn1yzcb/"}, "482": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "hmadkour", "Date": 1638529533, "Score": 4, "Body": "I'm currently doing a PhD in France, the salaries we're about 1420\u20ac after taxes last year and they increased for new PhD students starting this year. You're also expected to teach which will increase your salary by around 200\u20ac per month (you won't get that payed regularly though, you should treat this as a bonus). This is for publicly funded PhDs though. I am in an industry funded PhD, and salaries are at a minimum of 1500\u20ac and they're usually a lot higher since the industrial partner gets a tax write off for PhD students. You also get lots of benefits (health insurance, bonuses, company discounts, etc).\nHolidays are at a minimum of 25 days per year, but usually the labs aren't sticklers on that. I have 41 days off per year.\nA PhD here is only 3 years though.\n\nIf you do decide to do a PhD in France, consider cities other than Paris. You can halve the cost of living (especially rent and transportation) by going to a small city. In Paris nearly half of my salary goes towards rent, and groceries are so overpriced compared to other smaller cities I've lived in.\n\nEdit: students are considered a hybrid of employees AND students. You get the advantage of having student pricing anywhere that applies, which goes from renting and medical insurance to museums and stuff, but you also get the advantages of being a salaried employee.

I think these are set by the union so apply regardless of field and university, but I might be wrong there. PhD students are employees here with all the benefits and job security that includes, so that's really nice - eg I get occupational healthcare through the university. Cost of living is high here, but I've been able to get a studio apartment and pay off a big chunk of my student loan debt (did a bachelors in my home country) with only a PhD student salary.

I normally stick to 9-5 mon-fri and no one has an issue with that - currently cranked the hours up for conference season but that's a special case.

We were not poor, they cared for me and my father is one of the most intelligent people I know.

They speak academic language at home, while my parents don't understand what I'm working on. They learn, from a young age, how to behave in an academic environment, what to expect, what to aim for. I didn't. I'm the first of my family with a university degree, so I did not get advice. It has given me some sort of never ending urge to prove myself, to be the best in what I do. Very exhausting and also frustrating at times. I can write the academic language (because I taught myself from a young age on), but I am not capable of speaking it in informal conversations. It just does not feel right for me, it's like playing a role or putting off a show to fit in.\n\nWhat I am trying to say: your feelings are valid, feeling out of place can be hurtful. You feel out of place because of your ethnicity (and the traumatic history and present that is attached to being black), while your colleague next to you might feel isolated because of his/her socio-economic background, his/her gender or his/her orientation.

The more you read, the more the important papers will emerge (papers that everybody cites regarding the effects of procrastination). Some of these commonly cited articles will be historically important (e.g., the first published study or theoretical paper to frame the question) and some will be really high quality review papers that everyone agrees provide a rigorous overview of the topic (e.g., meta-analyses or systematic reviews), and finally some will be top-notch methodologially sound empirical articles from recent work in the field.\n\nIn general, the more you read, the more it will become clear - both what you are interested in (narrowing your topic), and what the current state of the literature is, so my suggestinon is to read as much as possible. If time is tight (and it always is in PhD programs) then skim as much as you can. My process is usually to start reading, and usually within a few articles something will grab my attention as interesting, and then I look up those references, find those papers, and down the rabbit hole I go. \n\nA few other recommendations, keep an annotated bibliography as you go - this will make writing the lit review a lot easier. Annotated bibs include the references followed by a few sentences or bullets with the main point.  As you go, these will naturally clump into clusters (e.g., physiologically focused papers vs. psychologically focused papers on procrastination). \n\nFinally, I just want to be clear that the task assignment makes a big difference. There are standard guidelines for writing systematic vs. scoping reviews, and those should be followed if the intent is to publish this review. If it's just for a class (or to help you review the literature in your chosen area of focus) then the method above is just fine.

I'm in my last year, almost 50 years old, a different journey in life but still very challenging. And I certainly don't regret doing a PhD. But I believe people need to know what they are getting into. People can dream all they want, but that doesn't mean the reality is similar to their dreams. \n\nSo, I will answer some of your questions, and comment on a few things you wrote, based on my experience. So, maybe you can make a more informed decision.\n\n1 - But what don't I know about getting a PhD? \n\nProbably almost everything besides the basics. It's a very unique experience. And very different for each person. And that's the part of the challenge, to try to find what a PhD would be for you specifically. \n\nWhat type of research you are going to do? What skills and knowledge are required for that type of research? What is the structure the university will provide to you? How much you will get paid (if any)? What's the personality of your advisor? What are the expectations about getting papers published in your program? All of that can be very different, and will lead to different perspectives about \"getting a PhD.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 - What is hard that isn't obvious? \n\nI don't know what you would consider as obvious, but I will list a few things that I know that surprise a lot of people:\n\na) A PhD is closer to a job than a degree. So, if you dream about \"advanced degrees,\" you may be disappointed by how it doesn't look like getting an advanced degree.\n\nb) Professors will not teach you much. They will provide some guidance, especially your advisor. But you're mostly self-taught. \n\nc) A PhD is very narrow. I know people say that a lot, but I don't think they take it seriously enough. Then, they feel trapped, confined. Having a lot of freedom but with very tight boundaries? Not what many expect.\n\nd) You will fail. A lot. Like a professor here said and I often repeat, failure is the standard for a researcher. Our experiments fail, we fail to find explanations for our findings, our requests for funding are rejected, our papers are rejected, we fail to get jobs, etc. Can you image how many failures those who research a cure for cancer have faced, foe example? \n\ne) Grades barely matter. Learning oftentimes barely matters. A PhD and research in general is about finding something new, contributing to the existing knowledge. Many students are amazing at learning the existing knowledge and getting grades, and they have no idea what to do about research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - What feels like it \"takes you out\" and kills your passion? \n\nIt's different for different people. Sometimes, the constant uncertainty and feelings of failure. Sometimes, the toxic academic environment and/or a bad advisor. Sometimes, the financial struggle. \n\nI won't say it killed my passion. But I gotta say it's damn hard to keep the passion alive when you're studying a single data set for years, and years, and years. When you are writing the same code over, and over, and over again, with just small adjustments. When you are writing version, after version, after version, of the same paper. All the while knowing that all of that is maybe for nothing, because you don't know if the final result will be worth of anything (you are researching, you don't know the results in advance).\n\nImagine a person who is passionate about travelling. And then, that person travels to the Eiffel Tower. Probably it's going to be amazing, right? But would the person still feel that passion if they have to stay at the Eiffel Tower for 5 years? Sure, they will know every detail about the Eiffel Tower after being there for 5 years. But probably the passion is gone, or at least not the same. They will want to travel to other places instead of being stuck at the Eiffel Tower for 5 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4 - \"When I was in construction, I'd spend all night reading about methodologies or material sciences to solve problems at work.\"\n\nDepending on your type of PhD, this can be dangerous. Most of the time, we are not here to solve problems, especially problems of the real world. Fields and programs with closer ties with industry tend to be better. But if your thing is to solve problems in the real world, academic research probably isn't for you. You will be happier in industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 - \"I love science, soft science, all of it.\"\n\nLike I said, a PhD is extremely narrow. Loving \"all of it\" is often a big part of the challenge. Because you will want to do \"all of it\" and be constantly forced to go back to the narrow thing you are doing. We are constantly tempted by other things, because many of us love many parts of our field and even other fields, and we are exposed to that. But we need to let it go, because we need to focus on the narrow research that we are doing.\n\n \n\n6 - \"Can I even get a job as a fresh PhD at 53 when Im done with school?\"\n\nI'm 48 and I'm not the oldest at my school. I just got an offer to become an assistant professor. So, I don't think age by itself is necessarily a problem. But check for things are for you field, and even for the type of research you intend to do. Be aware that not getting a job is always a possibility, even for younger PhDs. \n\nI'm not in Psychology, but I'm in Marketing. And I know we get many people from psychology because they believe the job market is better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7 - \"I taught one semester at a community college in construction. I love mentoring.\"\n\nSome PhD programs include assigning you as instructor. But i don't know how common that is. In general, a PhD is focused on research (and not teaching), you're by yourself (not interacting with students).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/r85gkf/talk_me_out_getting_a_phd/hn3ojzr/"}, "571": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "b_33", "Date": 1638558558, "Score": 3, "Body": "No this is a reasonable response.

You spend hours alone writing and wondering if your work will ever be read by anyone, and it's easy to slide into a downward spiral and neglect your personal life.

Your topic and tools will be focused - so focused that many who\u2019ve gotten their phds (certainly not all) find it hard to get back to that \u201ccurious about everything with a love for learning\u201d mindset that you have. \n\nSo honestly, I\u2019d think long and hard about it. Do you want to dedicate 6+ years of your life to learning one tiny thing in extreme detail?\n\nThat being said, you don\u2019t have to decide now. Seems like your love of learning would be great fit for doing more college classes and getting a BA and seeing where life takes you from there.

Not that an undergraduate degree is going to get you all the way there but it'll put you in the right direction. \n\nYou don't need a 4.0, be on the deans list and have research papers out by the time you are done but all of those things do not hurt to get into graduate school. I had like 3.1 or something. Some programs may want a masters varies by location. It's not like undergraduate education however most of the time it is a much more personal style of admission where you need to find an advisor or advisors youd like to work with, find out how they recruit and convince them and the department you are worth investing in.\n\nAcademic positions are hard to come by in almost every field psychology is no exception. You can try but don't count on getting one.\n\nIf you have 5 or so years to spare and enough money to keep yourself afloat  going after credentials you aren't going to really be able to spend capitalizing on later it is a waste of time. Just surviving and making money during and after without a career goal besides being an academic is going to be an immense struggle.\n\nIf you're retired and doing it because you have a personal interest and want to write a book or be an educator I think you'd be better off pursuing those interests in a much less formal manner but it doesn't sound like this is  the case.\n\nA Ph.D in a subject requires you to devote a large chunk of your life dedicated to work that will not be fun or meaningful. Science is like mountaineering, it is not fun to climb up K2 or Everest it sucks, going down a water slide is fun don't trust people who say science is fun. \n\nAcademic jobs require you got cultivate a CV that outshines a lot of people as well as a strategic amount of ass kissing, serving on a lot of committees, boards and volunteering your remaining time. The amount of work will exceed your compensation and you will find it is an education through labor. \n\nYou may find gratification in teaching but this will not advance your completion of the degree or likely pay your bills during or after. The academic environment surrounding students right now is particularly difficult. The type of student that attends a higher tier university with a psychology ph.d program is very different then local community College with a construction class. Not only are the students different but their environment will create a completely different dynamic. \n\nAt the end of the your time you will find nobody understands or cares what you spent all of this time on some may even look down on you. \n\nPh.D programs will not guarantee you a job and definitely not a career.

I've got tons of field research, lab research, programming and modeled research under my belt but absolutely nothing in a journal so in reality I've made no real tangible progress toward my 3 paper requirement to finish my PhD.

I'm doing it for all the miss-guided reasons I think you are considering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I tell people who want to go to college. \n\n1. Get a bachelors in something you care about AND has value to your future career. An example of the usual pitfall with a bachelors is marine biology. Marine biology is HARD. You work your butt off in those classes. Cheap schools don't offer the degree so you pay a lot for the tuition. Are there jobs in marine biology? Not many. So why not get a degree in something you care about that isn't going to cost as much, will be easier, and will lead to a reasonable career?\n2. If you want to go to graduate school for the love of research then cool! Start with a masters! Go to a 2 year masters in your chosen field and see how it feels. Are you still passionate after seeing first hand what graduate school is like? Maybe consider a PhD. Having a masters will rarely slow you down.\n3. Alternative graduate path... You want to do it for money. DO NOT GET A PHD. Read that again. DO NOT GET A PHD if you want to go to graduate school so you make more money. In almost every field I know of you can get a 2 year masters and get a really good job paying 90% of the salary a PhD would earn but you will do it in 4-6 fewer years. Those 4-6 fewer years have a real financial impact on you because you can save money earlier, invest in retirement sooner, build equity better, and generally focus on actually earning money sooner.

But it's training you to supervise and mentor people. That will be a good skill no matter where you go in your career. If you become a faculty member, you'll supervise a collection of undergrads, grad students, and possibly even postdocs as they advance through their careers. If you're tenured, you'll likely be tasked with mentoring new junior faculty members when they are hired into your department.\n\nTaking your question literally would be inappropriate, so I'm not going to. I doubt that I'm going to say anything that you don't already know; if you're in grad school and supervising undergrads, odds are that you're a year 3+ student already. You've almost surely given thought to the implications of mentoring folks already. Nonetheless, it is sometimes good to get a reminder of perspective. Now might be the time for it.\n\nI had a colleague in my last job (managing an academic lab) who was forced to supervise undergrads through pretty much his entire PhD and the postdoc he held after graduating. There were horror stories from the first two summers when he did it! But I'll say he was a stellar mentor by the time he finished up. Now he's a founder at a startup and he routinely hires folks with at most an undergrad education. Some of his hires have been undergrads looking for work experience, preferring it over academic research for one reason or another. For him to effectively employ them, he has to be a good mentor. He must be a good at defining projects they can work on in small chunks, particularly for the part time folks. If you knew him, you would surely know he could solve most of the problems he assigned to them in a week when it will take them a quarter or even longer. But they are small tasks relative to the things he has to work on.\n\nYour mission if you're in academia is to educate and train young people, first and foremost. As a grad student, your job is obviously to do a good PhD. But part of that process, if you're fortunate enough to do so, is to learn to mentor students. The skills you're learning now are going to be more important to your impact on other people for the rest of your career than whatever esoteric subject you're earning a PhD in, I promise. It will certainly suck at times, but it is a good process to take part in. And if your supervisor entrusted mentoring those kids to you, then your PI must trust that you'll be a good mentor. Why would the PI give you undergrads otherwise? The PI surely knows it's a pain in the ass to supervise them. But a good PI will also know that you can absolutely ruin an undergrad if you have a bad attitude about supervising them.\n\nI'd say if you feel like you're at or beyond your capacity, talk with your PI. He or she will have advice. Otherwise, keep on doing what you're doing. Make their responsibilities small in your work, but make sure they're working on something that will help you. If there's something that you think would be a nice to know but you don't have time to work on it, pass it on to them. It will become a figure in your paper or help you with your lit review.\n\nHopefully on the whole the students are good help to you.

It's hard to tell if this is just part of being in a PhD program or if this is because I'm the only Black person and the only person looking into this topic.\n\nHaving seen a few PhDs at various stages, I think what you described is pretty normal in any PhD. You're defining a moment or a sociological phenomenon or a trait that is unique to a certain part of the population. Or maybe it's a process that isn't very well understood. You're creating knowledge from nothing. Knowledge that will stay with humanity until we destroy ourselves. That much seems to be a common part of a PhD, no matter what you study. What's unique for you is how personal the subject is and how poorly understood it is by most of your peer group. I hope that gives you *some* comfort, to know that part of the process might be normal.\n\nOkay, from this point forward I'm just going to describe my perspective. I'm a white male. But I'm also a military veteran. And a few months ago I started a PhD, something that took me three or four years to gain the confidence to even attempt applying to. As a 31-year-old with my experience, I think I have something meaningful to share with you. I really can't relate to everything you're feeling, but I do believe we share some common ground.\n\nVery last comments below the spoiler text (I put it as a spoiler to hide it before jumping to closing remarks).\n\n&gt;!I enlisted in the Army with a 9th grade education and earned a GED AFTER shipping off to the Army! The four years I served in the Army defined my identity for that entire period and for several years thereafter. When I got out and started picking a school to enroll in, the fact that the school I landed at had a robust veterans program was as important to me as what I was going to major in.\n\nI'm not really sure how society at large perceives my community. On a college campus, most people may be indifferent to us if we are close in age to the typical undergrad population. But for me and those like me, we are all identifiable. Whether it's a hat or a funny patch or a particular piece of clothing (other than a hat) or a tattoo or a bag or some other subtle attribute, I can usually distinguish my peers from a crowd... The little black bracelets with silver letters etched into them are the worst ones to pick out my group. \n\nThat group was a crucial support system for me throughout undergrad and beyond. There were so many situations I didn't know how to face, and that community had cooler heads than mine who were able to help me work through them. More than once, it was a veteran telling me how to negotiate with a professor or some admin to solve a scheduling conflict or some other problem so I could stay on the right academic track. When an anniversary for one of my friends dying in Afghanistan came, it was a veteran who was finding me inconsolably drunk at a bar to talk through it and to make sure I got home safely and didn't hurt myself. Most importantly, they were modeling what someone with my background and my baggage looked like succeeding in an academic environment, and they were helping me to do it. When I was crushed by some part of life, they were inviting me to have a meal and vent it off.\n\nI don't know how relatable my experience is for you. I didn't understand diversity or why it was important until I applied to grad school, when I took time to seriously reflect on that experience. From fresh out of the Army with a little bit of PTSD and an awful identity complex to work through to graduating with two bachelor's degrees, that group was the one that made me a success. One member of that group especially stood out. He was the first enlisted guy I ever met who finished undergrad. He is Hispanic and happened to be the veteran's coordinator at my college. He's also ten years' my senior. The only reason our lives crossed was because of military service and higher education. That guy kept me alive and well through undergrad, much like guys like him kept me alive and well in combat. He was a big brother through that time, and last year he married me to my wife (he got ordained just to do that for us, and he killed it).\n\nI'd like to talk about one more person from my life. My capstone project in undergrad was a joint project with a Black man. His father immigrated to the United States from Nigeria and raised his family in Baton Rouge, LA. My classmate played football at my university. He was the only guy from my cohort or the one ahead of mine or the ones behind mine who was closing the library with me. Every single night, me and him were turning off the lights when they kicked us out. In our last semester together, he became a father. When we defined a joint project, he was the creative one who formulated the ideas for the proposal. That dude exuded creativity and self confidence and ideas. When we hit difficult points in the project, I valued and trusted his input and perspective more than I trusted mine or my advisor's. He just understood it. When the constraints of a homework assignment were pulled back, he was the best student in my class. He was a completely natural leader in a classroom or a locker room or wherever else he stood. When we were presenting a poster about our project, I asked him \"hey man, how'd you come up with this idea to begin with?\" His reply was, \"Ask an interesting question and then figure out how to answer it.\" I jotted it down and I've never forgotten it. But I don't think anyone told him how to think like that.\n\nI guess if you've read this far, what I want to say is this: You'll be successful anywhere. And no matter what you do, you're going to have a positive impact on the lives you touch. If a PhD is not for you, let it be that and that alone. Don't let it be that you're lonely as a trail blazer.\n\nAnd as a parting matter of practical advice, I'd say be open with folks about your experience and your struggle. That's what I loved about the veteran community. My community nailed diversity. I was more comfortable hanging out with veterans than any other group, no matter what their backgrounds or genders or ethnicities were. Those dudes and ladies were always giving it to you honestly. That honesty built trust writ large in my community. The younger folks in your program probably won't understand the importance of those conversations now. Hopefully the professors will. Hopefully the older folks in your program will. Candor was the secret in my community, and it's what I fall back on when I need to connect with people.!&lt;\n\nWhether you stay in academia or not, and regardless of the field you're working in, if we ever land in the same city, let's grab a beer or a meal or a coffee and discuss it.

Are you location bound - do you have ties that would make it hard to move. Doing a PhD and early career academia is very much dependent on you being able to move anywhere in the US and possibly abroad to pursue positions. For example, even though I live in a major metro area I will likely not pursue an academic career because I met my husband while doing the degree and don't want to move from the area now. \n\nWhat is your financial situation? PhD stipends are generally not enough to adequately live on, especially with rampant inflation. To get them you will be assigned part-time work that is often more like a full-time job and will generally be doing dogsbody teaching and/or research tasks that no-one else wants to do. \n\nWhat do you want to do after doing a PhD? Do you want to teach or do research primarily? It sounds like you might be more interested in teaching, but be aware that doing the PhD is all about research. It can be lonely and frustrating. You will need to find a small area of current interest, and contribute new thought to it. If you are more interested in teaching, and can get teaching work, you might want to do that for a while.\n\nIt is not necessary to be a star undergrad student to get a PhD and do well. In fact, it might be helpful not to be. A lot of people struggle with PhD because you will fail, and you are expected to direct your own learning. Professors are not interested in giving you a gold star or hand-holding you at every point. \n\nIf you don't already have your bachelors, then I would suggest getting a double major in your area of expertise and where you want to grow your research career (belt and braces). See if you can find a mentor who is interested in working with you. Your advisor or PI can, and will, make or break your PhD career. A good will get you conference and publication possibilities, open their network to you, help you chose good classes before you get the dissertation, suggest reading for you beyond what is required for coursework.

That honestly just bored a hole into my stomach, and I just couldn't focus on anything. A similar thing happened last year when I was working for a Research center in a different department, and I couldn't be funded since I was not in that department. So I had to switch programs, amd now I'm thinking that was a big mistake. I know I can do anything if I tried but things just hit hard when you have to pay for bills and tuition but get told you haven't been employed since last month.\n\n\nAnd I've tried looking into internships and just after having looked into so many and be told, \"you don't have any experience\", when I've does projects and research during my BS and MS.

Well at the end of my PhD I realized that I had been chronically depressed and developed severe anxiety over my entire PhD experience. I left my PhD unfinished because I just didn\u2019t have the strength to continue. I got a job in research doing mostly project management.

So at the end of the day all I have is depression, crippling anxiety, a significant amount of debt, and plenty of regret. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget research poster remodeling once or twice a year.

Whether you share the details or not is up to you, although I probably would not, but you should definitely say something and you should definitely not just push through it or try to ignore it.\n\nGiven how bad it is, it sounds like a leave of absence may be in order. I erred in not taking more time off for a couple of serious medical issues in the past. My advice to others facing similar circumstances is always to take the time to care for yourself. The job will be here when you get back, and, to be blunt, nobody really cares if you are heroic and fight through it to get the job done. I did that once and all I got for it was a bad review for not doing a better job in horrible circumstances (i.e., zero compassion for the circumstances or gratitude for not abandoning my students mid-semester, just grief for the fact that it caused a few minor hiccups for the class).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ramoki/i_have_a_severe_mental_illness_and_im_terrified/hnl3ll5/"}, "1123": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Magdaki", "Date": 1638880260, "Score": 1, "Body": "My pleasure.

My thesis examiners told me it was really well written and I stand by that being because of my ignoring of his feedback to this day.  I reasoned it was my work, and he hadn't supported me in any way to that point that I didn't expect him to come through for me in any way at the last hurdle, so I wasn't going to put myself through entertaining it! I also realised that feedback is someone else's thoughts and preferences so you don't have to implement any of it that you don't agree with, and if I wasn't going to change anything, I wasn't going to read it\n\nI set myself 100 days to write my thesis and submitted to the day. Didn't want it hanging over me, and so I also informed him that I was submitting, it wasn't a request, I did it on my own timelines (and because my funding was running out and I absolutely wasn't going to carry on beyond that point) so he got my final version once I'd submitted \n\nOn thesis writing note, I always gave myself one full day off each week to not even think about thesis, and found my most productive writing routine which included exercise, some socialising and even a week on holiday with absolutely no thesis at all. I set myself mini targets to complete sections in the morning, added in less brain intensive work like working on figures, checking paper citation info all present in the pm, reviewed my written sections from a few days ago etc. And if I wasn't feeling the writing I chugged away on something else that day as long as I kept to my deadlines to send things for review, and it worked!\n\nIf you're wanting to crawl under a rock and hide, I feel you. Setting some small goals to accomplish each day will help rebuild the motivation loop to get stuff done and make room for you yo have a relaxing festive season\n\nI think you have to take charge here, and do right by you to get this over the line.

On the other side, my advisor would keep me from going too crazy, making sure I wouldn't bite off more than I could chew. For that to work, we needed to be very honest and open with each other, and I think that was very important for my PhD experience. \n\nSo, I didn't choose the easier route. But I had a lot of support during the journey. The route may not be easy, but with the right support it becomes much more feasible. \n\nBut I don't think love for the work by itself is enough to keep going. At some time, I guess all of us my start hating the work, or at least not loving it so much.

I did sacrifice some of my hobbies (temporarily), but I remind myself it's temporary.\n\n- set yourself an early early deadline. I had a friend's wedding to go to early Nov and was pushing myself to get most of my thesis done by then. Very happy I did it, since now I'm just taking care of loose ends. \n\n- relish your effort! I suffer from terrible imposter syndrome, but the thesis was mostly a positive experience. It also gave the me the freedom to work where I wanted, so I could give myself space from the lab and people there that aggravated me. I also took a month to go home and write at home (which might not work for everyone). Being away gave me a big deadline to finish several important things before I came back. \n\n- i repeated \"progress is progress\" to myself on slow days. I wanted to finish my chapter today but really feeling unmotivated? Maybe I'll work on my table of contents or I'll tweak some figures. \n\n- keep a separate file open where you can write down discussion ideas as they pop up in your brain. Then revisit it when you get to the discussion section.\n\n- some ppl cite as they go. I opted to cite on first round of edits, since the main text was already there. \n\n- just write. Even if it's nonsense, even if you write with slang, get something down. Going back to edit is so much easier. \n\n- take breaks. This is a marathon and not a sprint. Resting is important.

At the archives atm and a small break down got me to this subreddit just now haha\n\nI'm not in my writing phase yet (actually starting the first chalter in January), but I might have some stuff to help. This is how I frequently do it, and maybe certain parts will resonate with you and be of some help!\n\n\n1. \"No bullshit\". If you write something, it HAS to be in there, all the other stuff can be omitted. Clearity is key, elaboration takes place within the thesis itself.\n\n2. The first sentence/paragraph of all my introductions so far has been something like \"this thesis does x, y and z\". Basically the abstract. If you are more of the school that starts an introduction with a story, than this part can come after that story. Here you just tell, by hard, what it is you have done. You do this because now you elaborate on what you have just written down, you can now write \"after the fact\" because you have already told the key points - this gives clarity on where you want to go with what you write, this is important as you are going to give pointers for the entire book. You have just given yourself a set-up, because now you'll need to explain what you have just penned down. \n\nAfter telling your thesis summary you can tell why your thesis in this topic is needed. Probably because what you have done does not exist yet. You are different. Other authors do exist however, and you have read their stuff to develop your thesis and you have used it - you need to acknowledge this, so now you begin to show what exists in your field:\n\n4. That's where the literature review comes in (although I always give a seperate chapter to it). When you do your literature review you only need to tell what others have done in relation to your topic - but only those pieces of information important to your topic. So you don't need to describe their entire book, only what they have brought to you: what they have done before you, how you build on them / how you disagree, how they might be wrong. So even though you are writing about them, you are secretly still writing about you and your work.\n\n5. Then you can go back to the whole \"well, by now it is clear what I do is different\" - \"here is how I've done it\": here you start to distinguish yourself in more detail from the literature you have penned down above, now it's all about you. You return to your questions, hypotheses and can even describe the archival material you have used and from where. You also descibe what the findings have been and how the question/hypotheses have been answered, and the methodologies used. (You can also go into limitations/pitfalls of the thesis if you want to, but those can also only be named in the actual conclusion of the thesis, where you point to further research.)\n\n6. This gives you a natural set up to the chapters of your thesis, where you develop your larger point in smaller compartments. \"Here is how I've done it - in smaller building blocks\".\n\n7. Here you round up your introduction in an introductory conclusion, which points to the findings and basically says \"you will see, as you read this book I have worked on for ages, that all of this is correct if we take the smaller building blocks together\" (\"within the limits of the possibilities of historical research blablabla\")\n\n\nFinally: no overthinking, you know what you write, you have been working on it for years. Be confident and to the point, and you will do great!\n\nI hope you can get some tips out of it! :) Congratulations on almost being there, keep it up, this is the final stretch!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/r77w5s/am_i_the_only_person_who_thinks_the_intro_is/hnqhml5/"}, "1354": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "a_random_small_child", "Date": 1638981960, "Score": 3, "Body": "I can't even remember where I started, it's fine.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rbmpn5/how_it_started/hnqhtwb/"}, "1355": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "yeyderp", "Date": 1638983896, "Score": 1, "Body": "As a fellow Compsci this is very relatable.

I'm in no shortage, but I genuinely enjoy meeting new people :)\n\n  \n\\- The current housing and renting market in Western Australia is a catastrophe; the 50% rent discount (which I presume has come about due to less international students) in uni student housing is what drew me to consider it. So it's actually far cheaper than everywhere else at the moment.  \n\n\nIn consideration of these and your points I'm thinking of instead maybe looking at cheaper sharehouses around the uni but external.

A great way to motivate yourself is to take small, small steps with the whole thing, take it in bite sizes...\n\n\u2022\n\nOutline your writing into sections.

I'm having a read through some of it now.\n\nI'd like to take the career path of academia, even though it's probably difficult to get into. I feel as though continuing to learn is what I need to do because I simply don't know enough yet to have confidence in myself.\n\nThe topic I want to research: It's probably self-interest driven, but oh well. During a subject I did in data science I realised work had been done in one area, but not another. I started searching and couldn't find much on it at all aside from 2 papers that either made assumptions that really didn't make sense, or proposed a solution that was limited.\n\nI have a vision condition called Keratoconus. Depending on the source, between 1 in 84 and 1 in 2000 people are afflicted with it. Keratoconus can't be corrected with spectacles. It often comes down to wearing rigid contact lenses which are as uncomfortable as they sound. There are new treatments for the condition that can stop the progression of the disease, but it requires early detection and expensive treatment, something that not everyone can afford, even if they catch it early enough. My particular vision problem is complicated by diplopia. Yay me.\n\nSo, anyway. In data visualisation, there's a strong emphasis on providing visualisations for people with colourblindness. There have been studies and solutions for even the rarest forms of colourblindness. The funny thing was, I struggled to see some visualisations in the course due to my vision problems which made me ask why isn't there a solution for people with low vision? Not just people with my particular vision problem, but all vision problems. I actively avoided creating some plots for assessments because I struggled to see them. I know the premise of providing a visualisation implies that the reader has vision, but there are literally millions of people with a range of different vision problems who can't access the data. That has real world implications.\n\nA lot of decision making and communication is provided through data visualisation. Cast your mind back over the last 24 months and you'd have no doubt lost count of the number of charts that have been shown to explain a narrative. Access to clear data is vital, but not possible for many people.\n\nI want to try and solve that. I know a common thought is that it will be difficult as there will need to be some kind of tactile solution, but I think everyone who has proposed this as a solution or thought it would be needed as a solution has overthought the problem and are creating new ones without solving the existing one. The reason a tactile solution doesn't solve the problem is simple. Most people who have some sight simply don't know braille and wouldn't be able to correctly interpret a tactile objects meaning. Proposing that as a solution is a bit like buying a pair of gloves for a person with no hands so their fingers don't get cold. It's a nice gesture, but utterly useless\n\nSo that's what I have in mind, but doubtful I'll get an opportunity to get there. I've based a large number of my masters subjects on learning different skills I might need to investigate it and find solutions, but I fear it's such a narrow area that wouldn't seem important or interesting to a lot of researchers", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ra2lz7/advice_on_pursuing_a_phd/hnu8rte/"}, "1525": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "franzkah123", "Date": 1639051582, "Score": 3, "Body": "Is the date for the proceeding masters correct?

Specially for a field like Computer Science, things evolve so quickly that the field can change drastically in a few years. \n\nFor example, my university was really a great match for me when I applied a few years ago. If I decided to apply now, it wouldn't be the case anymore. Things change. \n\nA lot of things changed due to the pandemic too, and we are still trying to see how things will be in the future. Concerns about privacy and ethics of technology and data probably will affect how things work in the near future too. So, there are too many moving parts and uncertainties about the future to make a detailed plan now.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rch8h5/i_really_dont_know_if_i_want_a_phd_or_not/hnv5ela/"}, "1607": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ArianaVentiButera", "Date": 1639065786, "Score": 0, "Body": "pertaining to your last point, i see a lot of people saying i should focus on finding a good researcher rather than going to a good university. but why does everyone say mit and stanford and schools of that level are the best to get a phd?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rch8h5/i_really_dont_know_if_i_want_a_phd_or_not/hnv5hx0/"}, "1608": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SamuraiBrz", "Date": 1639066209, "Score": 2, "Body": "The prerequisites courses that I know are courses that you need to take in the first years of the PhD, before you move to the dissertation.

They see something, then think of an experiment to test that immediately (or as soon as possible), or that they have a big picture in mind but design their experiments on the fly.

I'm around 1.5 years in, and I've recently decided that I too, did not want to be in academia forever. I also did my PhD straight out of my undergrad, and in hindsight, I took up this opportunity because it was the path of least resistance. However after 1.5 years here, I've come to realise that there are endless opportunities out there, we just have to be brave enough to take the first step out there to explore. (Of course, my time here led me to realise the dark side of academia which I really don't want to be a part of either.) \n\nI think the first thing I would suggest you to do, is first to find out what would be the potential sum of money that you would have \"return\" if you really left the program. I am not sure about your financial background, but to me, problems that can be solved with money aren't really that big of an issue at all. Yes, it is easier said than done, but here you would really need to weigh if staying in the program just because you have to pay back a big sum (worst case scenario) is worth your happiness, your mental health. Honestly to me, I value my happiness and my mental health. Right now, I'm both scared but equally excited to enter the workforce, where possibilities are endless. \n\nIn my case, I am lucky that my parents are supportive of my decision. However, I can understand what you're going through with regards to your parents being disappointed. I had that fear too, seeing how proud they were when I enrolled. However, I would like to say that your life is ultimately yours, you're the one living it, experiencing everything, and that it is extremely easy for external parties to pass any comments (good or bad). \n\nI guess what I want to say, is to live for yourself. Most importantly, whatever decision you make, ensure that you don't leave any regrets! \n\nI hope this wasn't too long and a chore to read through, please feel free to dm me if you would like a listening ear or just someone to talk to, or through your though process. \n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: like what new_tomorrow_511 said, also look at any possibilities of mastering out", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rcu47b/i_dont_want_to_do_a_phd_but_a_masters_option/hnxtafs/"}, "1736": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "archigreek", "Date": 1639105985, "Score": 1, "Body": "You\u2019re 17.

I worked in a lab for 6 months (something like a master thesis) before starting my PhD at a different university. My supervisor during the thesis (a PhD student at the time) was really nice, he showed me everything and after some time I was able to do everything needed for my experiments by myself. I was so proud of myself that when I finally started my PhD in a new lab at a new university a month ago I didn't ask critical questions about methods I was already familiar with from my work before. I just thought that I shouldn't bother the other PhD students (it's not called grad where I live so I avoid that terminology) and they thought I knew what I was doing since I didn't ask many questions. In the end I hid so many little road bumps during my first experiments (just little things like using the \"wrong\" BSA for Broadford assay because this bottle is like 50 years old but no-one threw it out. Everyone knew that one should just use the \"new\" bottle in a different fridge which I didn't ask about because I knew how to do a Bradford assay and saw the BSA bottle in the fridge...). Last week I did a western blot incubating with fluorescent marked secondary AB (because I found them in the Box labeled \"secondary western blot antibodies\" and just assumed that I needed those because that's how I had done it before... turns out the camera isn't able to detect fluorescence and everyone uses the ECL method which I did knew nothing about before. Looking back it's so dumb that I just assumed all those things just because that's how they were in my old lab and ofc I was so amazing that I should be able to do everything by myself and be able to figure this out. Yeah...  \n\n\nLong story short... Just ask them to show you the whole method from the beginning to the end.

My stipend is around this as well BUT it\u2019s not a burden yet because I live in a place with low rent, on average lower cost of living (just don\u2019t order out too much, food is expensive here), and I live close enough to campus (and really, most things) so I choose to walk or bike over driving as much as possible. It should be noted that I\u2019m married and my husband makes a lot more money than me so I cover half of the mortgage (we bought a house this year, again reasonable living prices compared to most places) but he covers the other bills fully now. However, I had to be long distance due to COVID last year and was able to pay for 100% of my expenses just fine and still have leftover money without roommates because rent was cheap. So look at the cost of living in every location and compare that to your monthly pocketed (post-taxes) earnings on that predicted stipend to get the most accurate picture. Also, ask each school if they have on-campus housing options, when I was long-distance I lived in the grad student/family/non-traditional on-campus apartments and it was slightly cheaper than renting outside of campus for more floor space, still small but I\u2019m used to overpriced closet-sized apartments at my undergrad town so that was a huge upgrade for me :P. \n\nI\u2019m lucky in that I live in a cheaper small town but I know it\u2019s not the only graduate institution located in a more reasonable-cost town, however I don\u2019t know which institutions you were accepted to and if they are all more expensive. If that is the case, you will need to make sacrifices. My stipend would not cover me in my hometown or my previous institution\u2019s town or the cities where some of the other institutions I applied to were located. In those situations I would have needed to either downgrade my living space, get roommates, sell things, budget groceries, ride or walk, etc\u2026. Until my husband and I we reunited.\nIn these cases, you need to figure out which expenses are most important for you and what you will need to sacrifice. The top of your list should be food, health, and shelter. Everything after that needs to be weighed by importance.\n\nI do hope all schools will adjust stipends to accordingly match the cost of living in their areas because 25-30k gets you very different things in different places and there shouldn\u2019t be a one-size fits all stipend.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rd1m7x/how_am_i_supposed_to_live_on_this_stipend/ho09ea5/"}, "1890": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "voabt", "Date": 1639155736, "Score": 1, "Body": "Congratulations my friend!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rd7def/i_just_got_published/ho09i99/"}, "1891": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "moongoddess64", "Date": 1639156132, "Score": 1, "Body": "Oof.

People with bad experiences have more of a need and motivation to share or vent. People with good experiences don't have much of a need to keep telling everyone things are going well, they just keep going unless someone asks. \n\n**\"describing it as a something hard and painful\"** \\- I think it's like asking athletes who are trying to win a famous competition. Yeah, it's usually hard. Yeah, it's often painful. But you need to see if that's what you want. I mean, it's a PhD, you can't expect us to say it's a walk in the park, right?\n\n**\"some people say it's hard to find a job, or they are paid very little.\"** \\- This heavily depends on several factors like the field you study, the research you do, the countries you are targeting, and what kind of job you want. It can be true, and if you're doing it for the money you should think twice. I'm in my last year, I accepted a job offer recently, and I'm happy with the outcome. Yeah, I possibly could earn more if I went back to a corporate career, but that's not in my plans anymore.\n\n**\"Too much work that I won't even get enough sleep\"** \\- There are two main situations. One is when you have a bad, toxic, abusive advisor. They can make you work to death. Another is when you have a good, understanding, and supportive advisor. They understand it's a lot of work, but that's not a reason to give up on your life. My advisor asks me whether I'm exercising, my department had a budget for us PhD students to organize social meetings just for us (before the pandemic). The advisor you get will make a huge difference. \n\nAlso, a lot of the excessive work of PhD students happen because students impose that to themselves. There is a never-ending list of things to do, that's part of the nature of research. If you don't know how to manage yourself, if you don't know how to stop, if you don't know how to say no, it can be hell.\n\n**\"Do you think a PhD is by nature hard?\"** \\- Research is hard. You are trying to discover something new. You are trying to do something that no one did before. You are trying to add to the existing knowledge, when there is an ocean of knowledge already. So, if you want to be a researcher, you are choosing a hard path. \n\nPeople may be tired of reading this, since I mention it often here. But, like a professor here once said, failure is the standard in research. Our experiments fail, our theories fail, our papers are rejected, our requests for funding are denied, etc. Try to imagine how many failures researchers have already faced while trying to find a cure for cancer, for example. Is that hard? Hell yeah... Maybe it's even impossible. \n\nIf something is easy to research, probably it's either irrelevant or very hard for some reason. Otherwise, people would already have researched and found an answer, and there would be no need to research anymore.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rdnnzb/thinking_of_starting_a_phd_and_already_having/ho2bmsd/"}, "1998": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Fish_Boi27", "Date": 1639186711, "Score": 1, "Body": "Send the link", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rd7def/i_just_got_published/ho2ctul/"}, "1999": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ThePhysicistIsIn", "Date": 1639188087, "Score": 1, "Body": "I mean in your shoes I had no pets, no car, and I had roommates. \n\nThat\u2019s how you afford it - by not having those things.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rd1m7x/how_am_i_supposed_to_live_on_this_stipend/ho2fv75/"}, "2000": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Giverny-Eclair", "Date": 1639188502, "Score": 1, "Body": "same for me tbh lol... \n\nI would say maybe I intentionally tried to keep a bit of distance to my lab mates just for working purposes, but still never end up getting really close to anyone ever since my PhD...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/qjmdkv/how_do_phds_find_their_including_but_not_limited/ho2gsb0/"}, "2001": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "BeefJerkyForSpartan", "Date": 1639189295, "Score": 1, "Body": "Fourth year here.

After completing my degree, I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do career wise, and because I was involved in research for a final year project (a curriculum requirement by my university), I thought I enjoyed research and that I wanted to do it. I got an offer to do a PhD, and took it (with scholarship).\n\nHowever, now that I'm 1.5 years in, I do not enjoy it at all, and in fact recently made the decision to leave my program. I guess my takeaway was that, doing research as a career in the industry is fine for me, but I don't want to be doing research as a \"career\" and make my life for the next (at least) 2-3 years all about it. Doing research as a PhD student, it felt like I had to constantly be thinking about my project, and having the pressure to be constantly updated on the latest news so that my ideas will remain novel. This was a lifestyle that I grew to learn that I didn't want to subscribe to, as I value having a good work life balance, which is something most PhD students do not have (based on my interactions with the people I know). \n\nI feel that passion is going to be a super important aspect and driver in one's PhD journey, and if you do not have that innate drive, it is going to be tough. On the other hand, there are some who are motivated because the career that they are aiming for requires a PhD. \n\nI took on my PhD because in hindsight, it was the path of least resistance. My advice to you, would be to think carefully. Some questions that I would ask myself would be \"am I really passionate about (your topic of interest)\" \"does my dream job/ career require a PhD\". If you're just interested in doing clinical research once you've graduated, you don't necessarily need a PhD to do research, but a PhD may help you get a managerial role (e.g. lead scientist etc) in the organization (based on my experiences in my country). It really depends on what you're aiming for. And with regards to your passion about research, I thought I was passionate, but I slowly I learnt that although am interested in research, I do not care about it to the extent where I would want to invest at least 3-4 years of my life and dedicate all my time to it. \n\nIf you would like to hear more about my experiences, I'm more than happy to share with you about them, just feel free to pm me. \n\nCheers buddy!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rdxqfp/advice_to_do_or_not_to_do_phd/ho4aaqn/"}, "2048": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LikeEpisodeVIThemost", "Date": 1639229608, "Score": 7, "Body": "For me it's hiking, video games, and playing music.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rdzp9p/i_need_a_hobby_and_live_in_a_small_apartment_help/ho4aj6x/"}, "2049": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lotischmoti", "Date": 1639229845, "Score": 39, "Body": "Video Games surely are a good distraction, but I like to be creative.

Since I've worked in several labs with different model systems, I'll tell you what my thought process was when deciding where to apply in case it helps. WARNING: long post. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nWhen searching for a PhD, there are scientific factors to consider but the non-scientific factors can be just as important (the commenters here make some great points on both aspects).\n\nSo the first question is which topics you're looking to work on. Maybe you're interested in a general area (epigenetics vs virology) but don't have a specific topic in mind and care about the techniques instead. Or maybe you're interested in a specific topic within an area (for example, you like neuroscience but don't care for neurodegenerative disease research and are more interested in brain evolution) but are open to different techniques. So that's the first thing you need to figure out.\n\nThe next question is which techniques you would like to learn/use during your PhD. Maybe you're interested in using CRISPR, or want to work with a STED microscope, or you want to work with mice but not flies, or you want to do cell culture and no in vivo work, or or or... So you need to find what matters to you and look for groups where that is actually possible. If you're not sure what you like because \"everything seems interesting\", then start the other way around. Which techniques do you not particularly enjoy? Within a topic, which areas are less interesting? And then you can work your way back until you find what actually matters to you. In any position, you'll probably have to use a wide range of techniques but not to the same level. For example, if you enjoy working with transcriptomic data and don't particularly care for imaging and the position has both but it's 80% imaging, then maybe it's not the right fit for you. \n\nSo you found a group you're interested in working with because topic, techniques and model systems match your interests. Now you want to know if the group/PI are a good fit. \n\n* Check the group composition. Is it a big group or a small group (both have advantages and disadvantages). What's the senior scientist to student ratio? Ideally, you'd want some postdocs around because if the lab only has new PhD students and the PI who hasn't been at the bench in 20 years, you might run into issues that could have easily been prevented by having a senior scientist at the bench. \n* Check the previous theses. In some universities, PhD theses are published and accessible. That way you can see what a standard thesis supervised by this PI looks like. Bonus: you can check the acknowledgments. This usually tells you a lot about lab culture. \n* If you're invited for an interview, try to talk to the group members without the PI. If you're there in person, you could take them out for coffee or a beer. The chemistry with your coworkers matters because you'll spend a lot of time together. Plus, you can ask them how the PI is as a supervisor. Are they very hands-on or do they leave you to your own devices? What's the normal PhD length under this PI (in some countries, it's up to the PI when you can submit and it ranges from 3-7,8,9 years). Do PhD students regularly attend conferences? ...etc.\n* Also, if you're there in person, take a look at the facilities. Not just at old vs new construction, but more so how the lab is kept. I've been in older labs that were very well kept and clean and in newer labs that were absolutely disgusting. \n\nNow for non-scientific aspects: make sure you won't have to worry about money during your PhD. Check out the city and make sure there's something that matches your interests *outside* *of the lab,* having at least some work/life balance is important. \n\nBonus: if you're not sure about the country you want to go to, check [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/r7qujc/phd_conditions_in_europe/). It has some great insights from people doing their PhDs in different countries. \n\n**TLDR;** Find what matters to you topic and technique-wise.

I haven't started my PhD yet, instead got a SWE offer from MNC in London. Personally,  I love studying a subject in depth and working on solving problems and hence I would go for a PhD a few years down the line.\n\nBut from my experience, a PhD is a lot more than just research. The first point you should consider is finance. Can your family support you, or do you have enough savings for yourself for the entirety of the PhD study? For me, as a Non-EU student, funding is almost non existent in the UK, and they charge close to 30,000\u00a3 a year in tuition. 150,000\u00a3 for 3 to 4 years including food and rent, which is unreasonable. In the US or Canada, its relatively easier to get paid around 25,000$ a year in stipends and u can earn a generous amount from teaching undergraduates. So ideally I'll move there when I do my PhD. \n\nSecond,  your age. Are you okay being close to broke (unless you're from a well off family) until you're close to 30 or even more. You wouldn't have any savings. Your stipend will be exhausted from paying food and rent.  You'll be old by the time you start getting some serious money.\n\nThird, job prospects. Private industrial R&amp;D positions pay handsomely after your PhD. But the catch is that you've to be REALLY good at what you do. For example - a Physics or computer science PhD will get paid around 100,000\u00a3 in DeepMind (in London)  whereas university positions even in my university pays around 30,000 to 40,000 \u00a3  to new staff. (information from LinkedIn and glassdoor), even Tokamak energy pays 35,000\u00a3 to new physicists. Compared with industry, I got an offer for 34,000\u00a3 as a fresh college graduate with absolutely zero experience. In 5 years people make around 50 to 60,000\u00a3 in these jobs if not more. Are you willing to let go of this prospect to follow your academic ambitions? \n\nThese are a couple of things you can consider before joining a PhD. When you're doing a PhD, that's a whole another challenge. Although I cannot speak about that since i am not in a doctoral program yet. Other redditors can help you understand this.\n\nI have decided to work for a few years, pay off my student loans for the MSc, hopefully get citizenship in this country and go for the PhD (with. 18,000\u00a3 stipend). That can fund me for a few years until i land something.  Ultimately, its about a noble cause. Your papers will be written in history. You'll leave your name in the research circles where you work. 200 years from now, some graduate student or researcher will look up your paper during their literature review. And most importantly, you'll learn a great deal about the subject that you love and u can teach other people. I believe these reasons are sufficient for me to sacrifice buying expensive crap with a job where I'll be a nobody and will be forgotten as soon as I leave or die.\n\n\nThis is my train of thought.

If you do, it does suck. I also didn't have student debt. So it depends on your circumstances.\n\nThe way I looked at it was as a cost of opportunity.

So it could just be that one prof being a gatekeeper.\n\nAnother consideration: I have a friend who had always done well in school but started floundering in her PhD. Turns out she had an undiagnosed learning disability that she had gotten very good at coping with but Grad school was more than she could handle.

Don't do part-time. You need to be on campus, in-person so that you can take full advantage of network effects.

It's becoming increasingly competitive to land in a tenure track position in the Top 100 schools.\n\n\\- The schools that don't require GMAT/GRE/some form of standardized testing tend to not be ranked that high and don't get that many applicants.

Undergrad and PhD aren't even in the same ballpark in terms of dedication, commitment, and intensity.

On a standard undergrad course, you're told what to read, what classes to attend, and given assessments and exams - it's basically scheduled out for you. The Master's is similar but with more of an emphasis on your own research and deeper specialisation into your subject. The PhD, however? You're on your own to research and write on your own time, you're totally responsible for scheduling and managing things yourself (your supervisors can be considered consulting figures rather than teachers - you're doing most of the heavy lifting), and you'd best be passionate and committed to what you're doing, because sometimes that's the only thing that keeps you going when data doesn't work or things go awry. The PhD is so much more responsibility because the aim of it is for you to learn how to research and to contribute something original to the field that hasn't already been covered.\n\nAs with the poster above, I'm not trying to put you off doing it if you really want to do one, but 100% find out what it is you're going into and that you REALLY want to do it.\n\nAs for what you should study, aside from meeting admission criteria, that's really up to you.

Dismissal tends to be reserved for students who don't put the effort in for non-valid reasons (for example, coasting on a studentship for the money without putting the work in). You've only requested a couple of extensions, not failed to submit anything for months on end.\n\nPhD life is not like employment in that you have X number of sick days per year and past that you are in deep trouble. A good university will understand that life can get in the way of your studies and that you may need a little help from time to time. It is also good that you made them aware of your difficulties from the very start. However, if it impacts your ability to research within a reasonable time frame (assuming you are full-time and expecting to finish within X number of years), you might like to consider switching modalities if possible. It is also worth reading the PhD conduct/academic regulations guidelines to see if there is anything specific on this. You could also consider discussing your concerns with your equivalent of the Research Degrees Office if this is likely to dog you throughout your PhD. Is it worth moving to part-time, possibly, to make things easier for you in terms of medical management?\n\nMy personal opinion is that you should be fine as you've continued to communicate with them on this subject and it's apparent from your post that you WANT to succeed. Keep talking to your supervisors and don't let fear overwhelm you.\n\nThe only other thing I'll say is that, as a first year, try not to get yourself too worked up about submitting absolutely the best possible quality writing ever each time that you submit to your supers.

One thing that has worked for me in the past was, I submitted a paper and after 6 months got a review back(2 times the listed speed of journal and after an email requesting the editor to update the status). The review was crap with like 2 good points. One of the reviewer had termed the paper out of scope. I was devastated but somehow I incorporated the 2 points and submitted to another journal. Got a major revision after 8 months with better reviews so I stuck with it.\n\nOne other thing I have noticed is that often the reviewers are not clear in their comments and at the start I was apprehensive. However, once I started the experiments it made more sense to me. Now I dont know if it was indeed the intention of the reviewers or not but once I submitted the revision with 50% changes in my non methodology section and answered every single question, the paper was accepted. You also dont have to agree to everything the reviewer says as long as you can defend your argument. E.g. one comment I got was, there's no need to show the hardware specs, especially GPU for this experiment. However, I searched and found out that the use of GPU was critical to the speed of the experiment. I replied in comment with the same and indicated that outside these minimum specs the experiments would be atleast harder to reproduce or at worse impossible to produce. No follow-up comments.\n\nSo I suppose the take away is, reply to every comment and change more than they requested and your paper will improve and get accpeted. Once you get a major revision it is just a matter to time and commitment. So hold on now!\n\nThe reviewers are also correct that the literature review should be specific. If you dont want to waste your previous 2 year work, just move from general to specific review by adding a couple of paragraphs related to your specific topic. Reply to the reviewer that while he is correct that literature review should be focused it is also important to build a context for the general reader first. So you have restructured the text to move from general state-of-the-art to a more focused one.

I set stupidly high standards for myself out of anxiety/perfectionism and then find myself completely unable to write because the task has become so big in my head. At that point, escapism through video games or Netflix or doing stupid stuff that can wait like chores become paramount.\n\nIt also depends on your ability to self-motivate. It's really hard for a lot of people when you don't have specific goals or dates to aim for as with a regular office job or an undergrad course. You're entirely responsible for yourself. When nobody else is watching you, it's way easier to get off track. Being in a public space like the campus library also forces you to focus more because there's less around to procrastinate with. \n\nIf you want it (I know you said it doesn't need fixing but I'm going to put it in case it helps someone anyway, sorry), my tips are: watch the Ted Talk by Tim Urban on the dark playground (where you have fun instead of working but it's still on your mind) and consciously make an effort to recognise when you're doing it. Think how much you'll enjoy having fun AFTER you've got something done without the guilt. \n\nSecondly, break the task down into manageable chunks. Sounds annoying, I know, but it helps. When I was researching for my literature review, I was given the tip to pick a topic per day and read five papers on it and make notes. Before that I was trying to cram read and putting more pressure on myself, meaning I did sweet FA. \n\nThirdly, either by yourself or through someone else, set up a block on your laptop/phone etc. for access to any social media sites you go to regularly and don't release access until you've got something done. Even if it's a 45 minute writing session, it's still something. \n\nSucks though.

The PhD life depends much more on the PI than the university so my foremost advice is to pick a PI that aligns with your expectations. The example I always give is micromanaging. I hate it and I could never be in a group where I am micromanaged. I even left a first position for another one because of micromanagement (and a myriad of other problems as well).\n\nThe application process can vary but in general is:\n1) Phd positions* are posted online (I can give you some links later today if you like),\n2) you apply by submitting a cover letter and a CV (masters degree might be asked for),\n3) after a certain period you most likely get an answer (some ghost though...) of either no or an interview (in person or online)\n4) for the interview, it can be a bit different from lab to lab. Sometimes you are expected to do a short presentation of your masters work for you sample. Sometimes it's super informal.\n5) they tell you if you are accepted or not.\n\nThese are very rough guidelines and of course it might be different. Regarding my asterisk *: sometimes you can apply to graduate schools instead of just replying to a job ad position. That's the case for the life science Zurich graduate school for example. PhD positions aren't only posted at \"regular\" universities but also at universities of applied sciences as well so that's worth checking.\n\nBasically the PI, more than the country, will make a difference and can lead to either a very positive experience or an incredibly awful one.\n\nWhat's your field of study?

I had finished my 2-years of coursework and I thought I'd be done with my dissertation in no more than 3-years (5-years total). Year 3 was spent taking extra classes because \"why the fuck not\" I thought, I was in no hurry. I had already fulfilled my mandatory 36-credits worth of courses and just paid for an extra year worth of courses due to my personal interest in a few courses and their focus. Year 4 was spent teaching all year at my university and it just ate up all my time, especially considering I had never taught at the university level so creating material and grading was completely foreign to me. During the fall semester of year 5 was when I finally had that \"oh shit\" moment and a sense of panic started to set in. At my university, they send out the Thesis/Dissertation announcements every month of students who are defending their thesis or dissertation (they attach Zoom links if you care to watch their defense). In your beginning years of your time in a Master's/Doctoral program, the names of students are individuals who are in cohorts several years ahead of you so you really pay no mind to them. However, by year 5, you begin to recognize the names and in many cases, they are people one cohort above or after you, or students within your own cohort. For me, that added a lot of stress, resentment, and pressure that I had not felt before. It was at that moment where I started to realize time was of the essence and I had spent a lot of time not dissertating. What scared me was I started to become really bitter toward my cohort mates who were on the midst of defending their entire dissertation or successfully did so. These were people I loved, cared about, had many fun times/laughs with, and wanted nothing more than for them to be successful. This was the first moment where I really had to self-reflect, look at myself in the mirror, and ask myself where these uncharacteristic feelings were coming from.\n\nIt didn't help that my university was in the midst of mass faculty/employee retrenchment and 3 professors from my department/doctoral program were on the verge of losing their jobs, including my dissertation advisor. Students from our program were picketing on school grounds, sending e-mails to our administration, and just doing what we could to not only save our beloved professor's jobs, but in reality, the doctoral program itself, which was very much in danger of folding due to a lack of professors that were able to teach undergraduate/doctoral classes, recruit prospective students, take on the responsibility of being a thesis/dissertation advisor to 100+ students, publish, and take care of their families. During this time, my dissertation advisor was understandably preoccupied with saving his job and thinking about the well-being of his family. Thus, responding to my e-mails and giving me feedback was secondary to his own needs.\n\nIt was during this fall semester of my 5th-year where I was at my lowest. I've always been a pretty confident, productive, and pretty decent at time managing. However, I was just lost. I felt like a failure, worst case scenarios an through my mind constantly (dropping/failing out, disappointment in my parent's face, not being able to find a job, having wasted 7-years of my life. etc.), and I just was directionless not only in my dissertation, but at that moment in my life. Lot of ugly crying in the shower XD and just not wanting to socialize/talk with anybody, not even my friends/family.\n\nThroughout all this, in 5-years, I was still stuck on chapter 2 of my dissertation, with essentially 2-years left of my doctoral eligibility before getting kicked out of the program. Keep in mind, I had already lost my first doctoral dissertation advisor due to her leaving for a better job at another university (tenured job), but I also think she gave me up due to my habitual tendency to miss chapter deadlines. I admit I was a terrible dissertation advisee and I would have done the same (missed 4+ deadlines in a row). I made excuses and usually made light of the situation when in fact, I was showing a lack of respect for my professor's time and missing deadlines in a sign of disrespect.\n\nWith having said all this, what kept me motivated to keep going? That's a good question and one I spent hours pondering late at night as I stared at my ceiling. I think several things:\n\n1. **My family** (mom, dad, sister) who supported me all through this journey. I've been one of the very fortunate few who have had my parents pay for my entire education (undergraduate, Master's and PhD) and the only way I can ever repay them for their commitment to me is to successfully finish out a program and present them with the degree at the end (as a \"thank you\" of sorts). \n2. My friends/former professors/teachers who supported and believed in me. They've all played their part in getting me to this point in my life, whether they know this or not and I want to make them proud. \n3. As someone who has learning disabilities (LD) and ironically, is writing my dissertation on the topic of LDs, I want to show people/the greater society there is no limit to what people with my label/disability can/can't accomplish. I understand that my disability hinders me in some way (short-term memory loss), but I'm not going to make excuses and I'm going to be just as successful as students without LDs through hardworking and persistence. I want to get my Ph.D so I can show other people with LDs that it's possible for us to be successful within higher education. \n4. **The support of my cohort mates**. One of my professors said something that I not only believe to be true, but sticks with me 6-years later, but she said that your doctoral journey is just as much group effort as it is an individual one. She meant \"group\" to mean your general support group, but she mentioned all her cohort mates who were instrumental in getting her past the finish line in finishing her Ph.D. They are the only ones who know what you are going through based on personal experience because they've taken the courses with you and have struggled through writing each dissertation chapter just like you. They are the ones you talk to when you need to blow off steam, give you that shoulder to cry on, and offer words of encouragement. For me and my cohort mates, we push each other to keep writing, even on days where we have hit a wall. We check in on each other, Zoom up every couple of weeks to see how we are all doing, and show up to each other's dissertation defenses. Are goal is for all of us to finish the program with our doctoral degrees. \n5. Lastly, I think of what my dream job is and it's working as a English composition teacher at a 4-year university or 2-year institution. It's all I have ever wanted and thus, to give me the beast chance to land one of these jobs, I know I have to soldier and on and keep writing so I can my dream a reality. \n\nI can't tell you what my epiphany moment was during my 5th year in the doctoral program, but I just woke up one day and just started writing. I told myself, \"there is no tomorrow for you,\" \"you are good enough,\" and \"think of all the people who are rooting for you and are in your corner.\" I just stopped making excuses and took full ownership for my dissertation and dissertation progress. I Emailed my dissertation advisor and made realistic deadlines that I knew I could honor and meet. This meant making deadlines that were double the length if compared to other students (2 months for each chapter). However, I know how I learn/work best, know I have a tendency to procrastinate, and thus, needed a bit more time to write.

They also weren\u2019t afraid to get to know people who were substantially different than their usual \u201ctype\u201d.\n\nThe work life balance you\u2019re describing is not only physically and mentally unhealthy, but it\u2019s probably keeping you from becoming a more well-rounded and, frankly, dateable, person. If you\u2019re struggling to find things in common or things to talk about, consider getting a new hobby, reading more, or working on self-improvement.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that establishing a relationship is about more than common interests. People can have different hobbies and backgrounds and still learn a lot from each other, have fun, and be compatible partners. \n\nOn that note, have you considered broadening your tastes somewhat? You don\u2019t actually need to be with someone who has a similar level of education, socioeconomic status or ambition to find a great person with a meaningful connection. Prioritize finding someone who is kind, fun, dependable, a good communicator, and makes you a better person for being with them. Plenty of smart, interesting and creative people don\u2019t go to college or have big dreams, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a lot to offer.\n\nIt\u2019s not about lowering your standards\u2014 never settle for someone who is disrespectful, manipulative, unkind or disloyal. It\u2019s about broadening your understanding of what a good partner can be like. If you\u2019re losing interest simply over the lack of a bachelor\u2019s degree it means you\u2019re not approaching dating with the mindset of actually getting to know someone, just their resume. \n\nIt\u2019s time to give yourself space to grow as a person!\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that it\u2019s super important to cultivate friendships with people. If you go out with someone on Tinder who isn\u2019t you\u2019re \u201ctype\u201d you should still consider establishing a friendship with them. It\u2019s going to expand your social horizons, and to be blunt that\u2019s extra important if you want to become more connected with your local gay community.

Some people maintain this kind of schedule surprisingly long, others (like myself) collapse with mental health issues within a month of working as much as you do.\n\nFor my mental health, I prioritize my tasks according to the mantra \"If it can't be done before 6PM, it's not worth doing\". Then, I DON'T WORK AFTER 6PM. EVER. Okay, that's a lie, for a very occasional major deadline I will work in the evening, but only if there are good reasons to. Even when faced with a deadline, I believe that 80% of the work gets done in 20% of the time and returns are diminishing on investment of extra time on a project. I have a hard limit of not working after 9PM even in busy periods or near deadlines, because not having time to wind down before bed affects my sleep and reduces my productivity in the following days. If you are regularly working until 11PM you may not be getting enough sleep, and sleep that is not restful enough. You may be working many hours because you are not allowing your brain the rest it needs to be efficient.\n\nSo my recommendation is: For the next two weeks, write down which tasks you believe need to be finished. Then consider the bare minimum standard to which they need to be finished to be acceptable. Do not be too perfectionistic here. You want to know what needs to be done for a just barely \"passable\" result, not a perfect one.\n\nThen, consider how much time it would take to finish the task to the minimum passable standard. Timebox this in your Calendar. Example: \"I need 1 hour to make these graphs passable for a presentation in the lab meeting\". This means your graph needs to be legible and display your data understandably, but it doesn't have to be pretty, it's not for a publication. Timebox all the tasks you outlined for the next two weeks, for minimum passability, in time blocks all before 6PM.\n\nAre there too many tasks to finish even minimally passable before 6PM? You are WAY overstretched. Consider shelving some tasks for a later time or cutting some responsibilities permanently if possible.\n\nDo you have time left before 6PM after timeboxing all tasks for a minimally passable standard? Great! You can spend the remaining time refining.\n\nDo they exactly fill the time until 6PM for the next two weeks? You are probably still overstretched - most people want to do better than just barely passable. It's probably still best to shelve or cut some tasks.\n\nBut the secret to planning for minimum passability first, is that you don't spend too much time refining one thing first, and then get into trouble with time with other tasks. You will find that if you produce complete, but unrefined work, all before 6PM, the mental load of work you do past 6PM becomes lower, less stressful. You know you can quit at any time and have a passable result. Overtime becomes voluntary. This matters, because we can focus our attention on things where doing well is more important, when everything else is at least covered.\n\nI wrote my Master's thesis this way - I wrote all sections fast for being \"passable\", made legible but unpretty graphs etc., that way I wouldn't end up with a PERFECT Introduction and Lit Review and super rushed Discussion and associated deadline-induced overnights. This way, you also have a more complete overview of what still needs to be done to make it better, and you can prioritize better accordingly.\n\nOn the dating topic... I solved it by dating a labmate, it's easy to spend time together but it's also literally impossible not to spend time together. :')", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rgo986/dating_life_as_a_phd_student/hongmyp/"}, "3216": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "edenchair", "Date": 1639581341, "Score": 3, "Body": "I feel I am in a similar spot.

Maybe something can help you. \n\nOne is that academia is a world where we are often trained to disregard opinions. We want to see evidence, proof, sound reasoning. So, when I have an opinion that goes against what we are doing during my meetings with my advisor, for example, I know that I first need to think about how I can convince him. Just telling my opinion is rarely effective. \n\nSecond, since I'm in marketing, we always discuss about the difference of having value and communicating value. We see many examples of excellent products that fail. Maybe trouble shooting is second nature to you. But are you doing that in a way that provides the benefit that people want, and are you communicating it in a way that they notice? For example, I often see people who are really good at pointing out the problem, but not so good at presenting the solution to that problem. And that comes out negatively. \n\nThird, I think this whole thing of who is better can be a dangerous path. Even Nobel winners had trouble convincing people of the value of their work, being rejected by journals, etc. Who is better and who isn't shouldn't matter that much, in my opinion. I'm not in this to win a popularity contest. One may be better at something, while another may be better at something else.

But the complaint process really impacted my mental health even further than the abuse itself.\n\nAfter 4 years doing my PhD in a lab, I found myself having to give up my project and find another lab to restart my PhD. A professor who had been witness to my abuse situation offered me to work for him and I took this opportunity.\n\nAfter the change I filed an internal complaint against my previous professor for psychological harassment. I knew this would not lead to much because he was tenured and he for sure would never lose his job over it... but I couldn't remain silent on the other hand, I had to do something. \n\nIt was only when I started this process that they realised in all his years at that university, 1/4th of his PhD students had discontinued their PhD, which is a freakon high number. Had I not done this, they would never have put these together and seen these individual events are linked to bad management. \n\nAfter reviewing my case, they did not acknowledge the harassment, but they acknowledged a very bad management on my professor's part. As a result, he was prevented from hiring any further PhD students on his own, except if another cosupervisor was involved and had to take a management training (which itself constituted a giant middle finger to this arrogant a**).\n\nWhen I talked about complaining I got mostly positive feedback, but I also had an instance of someone asking me why I couldn't just move on with my life and leave the poor professor be with his few years as a teacher left. No can do though. Sorry for this \"poor professor\" but it is because of all of the previous quiet students that I had been hired in this very problematic lab... It was because of all of these people wanting to move on with their lives that I had wasted 4 years of my life because none was taking my case seriously ... \n\nBut complaining is no easy task, and honestly I've needed therapy for the official complaint process more than for my experience in the lab itself. The process dragged for months, and I had to go through defending myself against the easy \"but she was such an incompetent student\" response... It was like reliving the abuse a whole new time over and over again. It would have been so much easier to just move on with my life, to forget about it altogether like it had never existed...\n\nBut I regret none of it. Now he has something written on his file, on the next complaint, he will probably not be allowed to hire anyone anymore and for sure he isn't going to run the experiments for his research himself. I regret none of it, because when they saw how many students had left his lab without a PhD, they proceeded to do the same for all of the labs of that department and brought up some other labs/professors to keep an eye on. \n\nI took one for the team and will never ever wish I didn't do it. I will also never feel sorry for that \"poor professor\"... because none is mourning all the poor students who had to waste years of their lives for nothing.\n\nedit: we have to do something about the toxic academic culture which is currently way too much accepted by our peers.

However, what they both had in common (and what I think can be a common trait amongst growing and established PIs) is that they had no concept anymore of how long experiments take and what is actually possible from the logistics of the manpower available. Same thing with writing grants/permits/reports \u201cthat takes an hour max!\u201d when in reality making the figures alone takes a couple of hours, not to mention the literature research and writing.

I was never formally diagnosed with depression, but I was terribly depressed for years and am still digging my way out of that hole. \n\nI was the last of my cohort... everyone else finished years before I did. I breezed through undergrad at the top of my class, breezed through my graduate coursework in a similar fashion, and then got completely stuck in the purgatory of my research projects and writing for what felt like an eternity. \n\nI burned out and dropped out after 6 years, but after 6 months I decided to come back to the same department but under a different advisor and in a completely different research area. Shortly afterwards, a close family member was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I spent 10 months helping them to juggle medical appointments and treatments, while simultaneously trying to keep my research inching forward.  Eventually I had to take another couple months off to provide around-the-clock hospice care as they wasted away and died. I didn't even have time to process that trauma, because I had to get right back to my research to try to make up for lost time. \n\nMy defense day was so anticlimactic. I cried when I was done, but some how I felt more ashamed than happy. The shame was (and still is) tied to how long it took me to finish, and how close I came to failing to finish. That day I just wanted to spend time with my husband, relaxing and doing nothing. I didn't have any desire to celebrate, and I didn't even go to the graduation/hooding ceremony months later.\n\nWas it worth it? No. But it's done, and like you, I finally made it through to the other side.\n\nIt does get better, though.\n\nI'm now several months into a nice job in industry. It no longer matters how long my PhD took to finish, even if I do have regrets about it. Many of my coworkers look up to me with admiration because of my education.

That knowledge and experience came directly from the years I spent suffering and slaving away in my research lab.\n\nBe kind to yourself. Grad school can be absolute hell. You made it through and accomplished something that only a tiny portion of the population accomplishes.

Don't try and do everything all at once. I spent my first year going in every day including weekends just to keep up. You need time each week to say aside for yourself. Not chores or errands, but good quality time to unwind before going back in. Burnout is real and it happens to everyone, but knowing how to take care of yourself helps. Don't be afraid of therapy or reaching out if you need it!\n\n2.) If you're teaching, set aside a weekly block for grading. I used to do it during tutoring hours when things were slow or while I waited on analysis results. Helps with making sure you stay on top of it.\n\n3.) Make friends with your cohort and those above you! Having people for support and to listen to venting is the best thing ever. Also, if (when) you practice your seminars, it's good to have reliable people there who want to to do well and will give honest critique. \n\n4.) If your advisor is treating you poorly and you've done everything you can to resolve it, go to another lab. Grad school is hard enough. Your PI should be another support system, not another headache. \n\n5.) Have a social life and hobbies! We're told that you have to live in the lab. That's a lie. This will definitely help with mental well-being and just make you happy in general. Also some people advise against dating in grad school, but if you can handle it and your partner understands the time and mental commitment, you're good. I got married a little over a month before my final defense. Trust me, the right people make it work.\n\n6.) Speaking of that, maybe don't plan major events whole in grad school? Mine was unintentional since I didn't plan for a pandemic and my defense getting pushed up a semester, but it just adds extra stress. It's doable, but the weight on my shoulders at that point sucked.\n\n7.) Also also DO NOT TRY TO WRITE YOUR DISSERTATION IN 2 WEEKS. Take it from me, procrastinating isn't your friend. Start early and write daily, even if it's just a few words. At the end of the day, words on paper is the goal. \n\n8.) Don't try to run tons of experiments at the same time unless you've done them a ton/they don't require heavy babysitting. Want to run some IR while using a column? Sure, but don't try running multiple columns and polymerizations at the same time because odds are one will get messed up and you're starting over. \n\n9.) Don't be discouraged if experiments don't work. Failing is part of science and helps us learn! Don't beat yourself up and instead look at what happened to try to make changes for the next experiment. Plus, PIs love it when you come to them with potential solutions for a problem you're having vs just saying \"I dunno\".\n\n10.) Keep a good notebook. If not for you, for the poor student trying to find that one experiment you did ages ago that they need for their work. Plus put the page numbers off the experiment in your file names with data. Makes it easier to trace back when looking for something to make a figure.\n\n11.) If you've got vacuum pumps, make a maintenance schedule for oil changes. A seized pump is a useless pump.\n\n12.) Close all those article tabs. You and I know you aren't reading those any time soon. \n\n\nThat's all I can think of right now, but if I think of more I'll add on!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/riynua/45_years_later_and_i_escaped_with_my_phd_in/hp23cn8/"}, "3658": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dbarcari", "Date": 1639842605, "Score": 2, "Body": "Hello friend.

Most of them also realize they are not that once-in-a-decade genius for whom it all comes easily and naturally, so their only way to stand out is through their unparalleled dedication and sacrifice. They want to feel their suffering is a necessity, that it's worth it. They want to feel special and unique for being able to put up with it.

I know first hand how traumatic, unpleasant, demotivating, and straight annoying this can be.\n\n&lt;backstory you can skip&gt;    \nI was heavily bullied by a domestic student in my first year as a PhD. Later I discovered it was actually a bunch of students, including one of my room mates who has a very vivid imagination. The stories I heard about myself spreading around my program were ridiculous. Unfortunately, some of the faculty were involved in it too. As a result, I lost the advisor I had come to work with, changed my research interest entirely, isolated myself from the program, and have a hard time to trust the institution. I still don't know the reason to be subjected to the bullying and I will never know. Even though the Title IX office got involved in the matter, it didn't solve anything. My, now former, program director told me and another PhD student when we came to his office, and I quote, \"this is how academia is, get used to it\". The bully, who had had history to be unpleasant and bullying other female students before I was around, is still in the program and is now teaching an undergrad course. Sigh.  \n\n\n&lt;/end of the backstory&gt;\n\nAs SulphurSnuff pointed out quite well, a lot of PhD students can be socially inept or borderline sociopath. In my case, the guy got triggered by people knowing more about a matter he perceived as \"his\" and he thought he was more knowledgeable in. He had a hard time understanding that there are people equally or even more intelligent than he is. His target were women, he was spreading rumors about them, using his lovable persona around all the faculty, painting women he attacked as unreliable, unstable, etc., profiling people from talking with them once, etc. When confronted he didn't know how to handle it as a normal human being. I blame how socially inept he was. But that's not an excuse for him treating people like this.\n\nI wish I had a better advice but **be assertive and stay calm around the person**. **Keep all the conversations in print** (emails, Slack conversation, whatever you use) in case they try to gaslight you. If there are more people feeling the same as you, **do a group intervention**. Bullies don't thrive when there are more people standing their ground. Show them evidence of their misbehavior and tell them you don't like it and why. If it doesn't help, take it to your program director or the Student Office. If someone tells you you are a troublemaker, brush it off, and stand your case. Be brave! You just want to be treated as a human being, not a doorstep rug.

Chronic leader of tomorrow and anxiety sufferer doing PhD here, so I feel your pain. In my case, my procrastination is rooted in perfectionism, which is in turn rooted in self-imposed pressure to make sure everything I produce is of a high standard. This creates an endless feedback loop in which the pressure I put on myself makes the task in my head SO BIG that the more I think about it, the worse it becomes, and the more I end up doing absolutely nothing at all.\n\nTips for overcoming this:\n\n- you might benefit from speaking to a student counsellor. Worst case scenario you get your concerns off your chest and some support, best case scenario you get qualified counselling for tackling the root of the procrastination (it's often related to anxiety caused by self-esteem tied to performance and fear of failure).\n\n- break the work down into bite size chunks to get rid of this sort of BIG TASK syndrome where it becomes borderline insurmountable in your mind. For example, for my literature review, I was trying to cram read a ton of different papers on different topics, and all it did was make me feel overwhelmed and stop reading. I was advised to pick a topic per day and read just five papers on it. Much more productive and much more manageable too.\n\n- it might help you to make a mind map or plan or flow chart to visualise what you need to do in manageable steps and tackle things one day at a time. It helps crystallise your thoughts.\n\n- watch Tim Urban's TED talk on YouTube about procrastination and what he calls the Dark Playground (where you want to do almost anything else other than the task at hand but it's still in the back of your mind making you feel guilty - you're essentially doing the work in your head). Think about how good you'll feel if you just set yourself a manageable task and play games or watch Netflix or whatever it is you want to do after you've done it, guilt-free. \n\nMaking things manageably bite sized sounds like anathema to procrastinators like us, but it really is much better to get into that habit. \n\nAs for imposter syndrome, been there too, and it's quite common among researchers (I wish I had known that earlier!). Again, it's often tied to anxiety (I'm not good enough, surely I should be able to do this if I were, people will realise what a fraud I am, etc.). \n\nIf you have the sort of relationship for it, it might be worth sharing these concerns with your supervisor. You'd be surprised how supportive they can be - but it really does depend on your bond with them and their character. Failing that, definitely approach your research degree team/mentoring team/student counselling body for some support. It will help you feel less alone and more able to cope.\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rk7zur/how_do_you_deal_with_procrastination/hp8jsgi/"}, "3916": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "seagreengoddess", "Date": 1639961322, "Score": 2, "Body": "I moved to the beach to study for quals and one professor called it my \"sabbatical.\" I just wanted to dip my feet in the ocean while reading Butler.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rjw2zv/i_honestly_dont_get_the_work_culture_in_academia/hp8jtq9/"}, "3917": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Rat-Dot-Com", "Date": 1639961748, "Score": 1, "Body": "Why are you taking this so far?

Your research is \"your homework\", and the uni expects you to do your homework no matter what.\n\nIf the ironic tone was not strong enough, just to clarify: I don't think this is healthy and I don't support this perspective, just what unis tend to communicate to PhD students.\n\nThere are ways to get around this (enjoy conferences, go to social activities in the uni, low key things like that). However, you will not get anywhere discussing that issue with the uni. You can even forget you are at a university. You are in a lab. most things that happen beyond your lab's walls are irrelevant (paperwork-wise), so I suggest you try to work within its borders, at least at first. Try to set expectations that make sense with your PI. It was mind boggling to me how much power PIs have over their student's careers!\n\nThere is also this stupid idea that respect is correlated with your suffering, which is super crazy, and you guys should dismantle. For now, try to thicken your skin.\n\nIn my case, what helped the most was to build a peer group where we supported each other. Me and some friends from gradschool got involved in a student association, and used it to meet, vent, share research (and non-research) ideas, party, cook, etc. To the point where we would send messages in the middle of the night when we were crying and doing experiments, so the rest would support us and send us nice messages. I couldn't care less if it sounds cheesy, but I will never be able to thank them enough for keeping my mental health afloat.\n\nMy point is: don't expect the system to help you in the short term.

For some it's recording themselves talking through it. Whatever 'it' is, the aim is to make sure that when you get to the actual writing bit, you have specific goals/outcomes for every section, and a map of how you get there. The writing bit is just putting words on the page that achieve what you've already decided.\n\nIf you can, set up all your writing stuff - computer, books, notepads, etc. - in one room. Do your work, and *only your work*, in that room and nowhere else in your home. Don't let the work spill out across the whole home so that you can't escape it: it exists in that one space and nowhere else.\n\nBreaks are incredibly important.

Yours sounded like it ended up being structured slightly like mine, with little to no heads up to you\n\nFriends of mine at my university but in a different program had a presentation on their thesis work and then Q and A on that only. They got to select committee members and they didn\u2019t have a general science section\n\nIn my program, we had no say in committee members with no right to petition. Committees are made with the goal of having people OUTSIDE your field. We don\u2019t get to present anything, we have to submit a mock F31 application and that is the ONLY information we can refer to during our Q and A on our thesis work, which is half of the exam. \n\nThe other half is a broad science topics exam and each committee member would pick a subfield within their field to ask extremely detailed questions on. We were informed of those sub fields three days before the exam. That means in my program, students have to study three broad fields outside their work when they find out their committee (~1 month before exam) and then study three smaller fields in extreme detail for three days leading up to the exam. We knew this was going to happen and tbh it was much more work than the thesis part of my exam and on information irrelevant to my thesis. It sucked but was a hoop to jump through\n\nI think comprehensive exams are described too frequently as a longer thesis committee meeting with different members. They aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a way for the university to make you jump through hoops to \u201cmake\u201d it past that point and get you out of your comfort zone of your thesis field. As much as you like/dislike it, that\u2019s what it is. It sounds like nobody told you to prepare with that outlook. The fact you have someone in your field on your exam committee or not really shouldn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s about showing how great of a student you are, how well you can understand topics you\u2019re not meant to be an expert on, how logical your project is, how well you can explain your research, how much your general knowledge base is, etc.\n\nThe good news is you now have a few months to study these topics. Read papers your committee published and from their fields. Learn what techniques they would use and how they work. Understand all basic information from those fields like you should know everything that would be included in an undergrad textbook. You even have an advantage because they asked you questions at your first exam so you know the level of detail and general topics they want\n\nAnd just to add, either that one committee member is a complete ass putting their head down on the table or you somehow made an ass or yourself. The #1 piece of advice I got in preparing is to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. The point of the broad section was to question you until you got to that point and could actually admit it.

Some of my friends have part-time jobs in the service industry, and they turn out fine. In fact, if it's not relevant you don't need to put it on your resume.   \n2) If you are in fact being hired part-time during your Ph.D. as a coordinator (or someone close to the process of conducting a study and not a personal assistant or receptionist - not that these positions are bad), it might actually help your profile a bit. Especially in public health where I think it's an advantage to spend some time living closer to the data. Furthermore, if you're planning to be a researcher at that institution, understanding and knowing the research staff is definitely a boon.   \n3) However, at the end of the day, while it doesn't hurt you and in fact can help you, it can't take center stage to your research projects.

Many of the things I do seem overly structured / clinical to an outsider, but it's a necessity. \n\nPhDs are hard, and by their nature they don't have a standard, a rulebook, a how to guide. But there are commonalities. \n\nYou need to structure your time, your tasks, your reading, and your knowledge. So I'd encourage you to have a system for each. \n\nI break my work down into compartments.\n\nOrganising tasks: look into the getting things done method, or \"Zen to done\" for something easier to approach. \n\nOrganising time: Deep work by Cal Newport. Prioritise deep work or work that requires concentration early in the day, with unbroken attention. Use the pomodoro technique to manage small sprints. \n\nPersonal knowledge management system. You have to learn and read a lot. It's hard to know how these connect and interlink, and see in one place. I'd recommend the software \"obsidian MD\". It's based on the zettelkasten technique, which is a way to note and connect knowledge. The book \"taking smart notes\" explains this really nicely. \n\nReference management. Zotero, you can integrate this with obsidian quite nicely. Make tags for to read, read, noted etc. \n\nLearning: spaced repetition. Anki is a good tooll for this. Look into the book \"a mind for numbers\" for great literature on how to learn effectively. \n\nInbox zero to keep inbox and mind clear. \n\nFinally, meditation. Meditation helps with all of the above. Focus, organisation, and most importantly happiness and relieveing stress! \n\nAll of these require the development of good habits. So if I were to make you a plan, I'd recommend the following:\n\nRead atomic habits. \nTake on one of these recommendations I've given at a time, stick at it for 30 days, then build upon it. \n\nOrganise your tasks. \n\nOrganise your time. \n\nOrganise your knowledge. \n\nOrganise your learning. \n\nSuccess. \n\nBest of luck and let me know if you want any more info!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rlbbvc/executive_dysfunction_and_complete_lack_of/hpfif6w/"}, "4150": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "iamthephixnux", "Date": 1640099477, "Score": 9, "Body": "I have a 1 hr commute.

I didnt use it for PhD work, but for the smallest easiest tasks I struggle with but that seem easy for most people. I'm talking I have \"brush teeth\" in there, \"Check e-mail\", etc. In bad days/weeks, if a bit of motivation appears, even if its completely minuscule, instead of feeling overwhelmed by all the work that's ahead and turn to whichever coping mechanism I have at the time, I'd check my todoist knowing there was surely something I could do! It worked as a safety firewall stopping bad days from spiraling down into bad weeks, into bad months, etc..\n\n\nAlso, it's fine to work in bursts of motivation, its fine to spend a few days being unproducive as fuck, because hey, we made it here, that means, on average, at the end of the day, we get stuff done one way or another otherwise we would have never made it past highschool/uni.

For the last year, I've been using VSCode for LaTeX (and Python) exclusively. I'm starting to explore other options now too.\n\nThe main advantage of the other options is that text editors like VSCode, Atom, Sublime are *designed* for people who write a lot of code, not simply sentences. These editors are designed for use cases where you have to constantly use special characters, indent in special ways, move cursors in and around brackets {}. They are much more widely used in industrial and academic settings, spanning dozens of programming languages. There is a much bigger community of support for technical issues. If your LaTeX documents are full of dense math, special formatting, and anything that feels like you're 'coding' more so than writing words, you'll benefit greatly from the existing features of VSCode. Further more, VSCode (for instance) easily integrates with other languages, has Git/Github support, debugging, provides a terminal. It's convenient to use the same editor for TeX as you do Python. The same theme customizations, snippets/macros, keybindings can apply across several software uses.\n\nI mentioned Vim elsewhere. I don't like Vim as a text editor, but I just started learning its keybindings, and VSCode enables Vim keybindings via a shortcut. Atom also enables Vim keybindings and I'm sure Sublime does. Not sure if you're aware of what Vim is, but I'm not going to give a recommendation to use it since I myself am still in the learning stages. But I believe it's an investment that will pay off in a year. VSCode?

I commuted 140 miles a day in order to live with my wife and do the last three years of my PhD. It was about an hour and a half door to door. Does it suck? Yes. Can you do it? Yes, absolutely. \n\nMy PhD was rigorous and it dominated every aspect of my life for nearly 6 years. I published 3 first author papers and had a total of 11 co-authorships. You can be productive, just be prepared to do the ~3hours of driving on Saturday to go in and do 30 minutes of cell culture just to keep your shit going. \n\nSome people are going to tell you about work/life balance. Unpopular opinion incoming: you\u2019re middle aged, you don\u2019t make shit as a grad student, you\u2019ve got to get in and get out and squeeze every bit of clout you can out of those few short years. I personally don\u2019t want to move to another state for a job/post doc, so I wanted my resume to be the best one in the pile so that I can be near my wife and work the job I enjoy.\n\nI\u2019ll give you the other side of this coin regarding commuting, which I did during years2-3 of my PhD: you and your spouse get separate apartments an hour and a half away from eachother. You\u2019ve lived together for like 7 years, so splitting your stuff is like getting divorced. Do you need a second vacuum, or just cart the one you own back and forth? Who gets the coffee pot? The big pasta pot? The cat??? Who visits who and when? What if I have an experiment running over the weekend?\n\nLiving alone sucked. I dove deep, deep into work and pulled 14 hour days, because I had nothing to go home to. Laundry, cooking, cleaning all took a back seat. I attempted to work out in my free time, but that ended quickly. I started drinking quite a bit, both with lab mates and alone. One night, I was walking home from the bar at 3am and I fell on ice and cut my hand. That was the day I decided I needed to live with my wife again. She was not doing any better. We are co-dependent. We moved back in together 3 months later.\n\nTips for the drive: podcasts are your friend. Don\u2019t know how much of a nerd you are but I dove into Critical Role and they have over 1000 hours of content in podcast format. There are long form podcasts where people just shoot the shit for hours, it makes you feel like you\u2019re sitting at the table with them. Also, audiobooks are great. Some days you need to just headbang on Spotify though. You can also practice presentations pretty easily.\n\nKeep yourself alert! I attempted many drives that I shouldn\u2019t have because I was exhausted. Stop. Fill up on gas. Grab a snack and a drink. walk a lap around the gas station.

Do you think it's not right for you because you don't have the credentials to get the position, or because you don't think the lifestyle is appropriate for you? I personally don't believe that you need publications to become a PhD student - not everyone gets a paper out of master's. \n\nAbout having no credentials to show for: \n\nI worked in a lab for over a year, alone, 9am to 9pm, Mon-Fri, when I was in my second year of undergrad. While my peers were out enjoying uni life, I worked my ass off in a lab with an unappreciative professor who left me to get all her data for her. If I wasn't in class, I'd be in lab. I'd go home to the dorms, crash til 12midnight, study/assignments until 3am, go to sleep, lab at 9am.\n\nThings I earned: technical skills (molecular bio, plant culture, genetic engineering), crippling depression, severe burnout that took over a year for me to get out of. Having said supervisor tell the school counselor that I was 'unstable'. \n\nThings I didn't earn: papers. For all the hours I worked, data I got for her - I got nothing. \n\nFinal year research went about the same too. Hours of microscopy, made only bearable by the fact that I knew when to say no and go home, and to take breaks every 3months to stave off burn-out, I withstood abuse during monthly seminars by the head of my then-lab... got nothing out of it. \n\nI went into masters knowing that I had 2 years of so much lab experience under my belt and zero papers or concrete results to show for it. It was painful. I bought myself a bottle of ice wine from my graduation trip with a friend and told her that we'll drink it when I finally my first paper published. I finished my master's a few months ago, and paper? Not yet - first draft of my two manuscripts are done though. \n\nDoes it still make me self conscious? To some extent, yes. Most part, no. But my master's/PhD supervisor didn't get his first paper out until he became a Postdoc, so... yeah. \n\nAbout your last paragraph:\n\nI feel like science in general is going to wreck ones mental health - there's only so many times your experiments fail before you start wondering if it's you that's the problem, rather than an unoptimized experimental design, and then let's not forget imposter syndrome and all the fun bits to that. \n\nBut I consider myself an emotional marshmallow too. I have anxiety issues that can become so crippling that I end up stuttering just to tell my extremely supportive supervisor that I need to take a few days off because my anxiety is acting up - as if he can't already directly tell from my body language LOL. \n\nI had a massive bout of imposter syndrome on my third day of PhD that had me crying in the office and then at home for the rest of the day. I am extremely emotionally aware of the bucketfuls of issues I have related to social relationships and familial issues, and those are the issues that have me crying on my walk home some evenings. \n\nBut I've wanted to do research so badly since I entered university. There isn't any other work/field/occupation I can see myself doing except science - and I say this even after I was driven into depression and severe burn out because of lab in 2nd undergrad year. Doing research? It's terrible. It's exhausting. It's maybe semi-rewarding on the best of days. But I do it because I can't see myself doing anything else but research.\n\nDeliberate on how badly you want to do a PhD. Emotional issues nonwithstanding, is this something you really want to do? Is it necessary for what you're aiming for? If yes, then do it. Talk to the PI - if they're great and extremely understanding, they might be able to understand your issues and help you with it, provided that you too, are willing to work hard for the project. Personal issues-wise? It's as competitive and stressful as you and your PI make it to be imo. And also talking to the school psychologist can help, if you're open to trying to make it work for you. \n\nBest of luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rlmn5c/deleted_by_user/hpjcshd/"}, "4381": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nathan_lesage", "Date": 1640164078, "Score": 1, "Body": "Well, even with humans it\u2018s like that \u2014 I\u2018m doing a sociology PhD and a lot actually revolves around the same ideas!

If you only have a vague idea of this, then don\u2019t do a PhD, do a masters and see what areas you like. \n\nSecond, PhD is a huge time sink and money loser if you come from high paying industry. As Engr manager at large tech, you stand to lose &gt;2m in earning potential over time of PhD. Are you willing to have your degree be that expensive? Then what jobs are you thinking of when you get out? I\u2019ll let you know unless you\u2019re a top ML researcher you will never make anything close to your current TC in national labs/academia/ industry research group following your PhD. You will exit as junior scientist which is a totally different track. Are you willing to totally reset your salary track?\n\nFinally I would not recommend the culture of academia. It\u2019s much different than industry and values overwork. Work can be collaborative, but your PhD will be a lonely process of you grinding against the research. I personally missed how much time I got to spend working with colleagues in industry while doing my research. I also developed depression during my time. \n\nI am likely biased, so take my advice with a grain of salt. But just look over these forums and you\u2019ll see my experience is congruent with many others. I don\u2019t know what to do after being drained of corporate. You can change jobs to something that allows you better hours. You can also move towards technical path of software instead of management. You can also just leave your job and take a break for a bit while you clear your head from corporate BS. I dunno, I just think PhD is a radical departure from what you\u2019re doing. If that\u2019s what you really want at end, then try Masters. At end of that, ask yourself very hard does PhD really work for my future life goals.

But whether you should refuse this opportunity, with what could be a world leading academic, because of this interaction is to be debated. You may be a good enough student to easily take another good opportunity but that may not be the case as competition for placements can be fierce. Any high level academic with a large group will be busy, if they have 20+ PhD students then just by the law of averages you will not command a lot of their time. This does not excuse being rude but accepting that experiences like this are common for PhD students might give you some idea of what you are in for, I don't think many students are prepared for how independent the learning and research can be and it varies greatly from PI to PI. I would thoroughly recommend contacting some current/previous PhD students, most academics have a department webpage and you should be able to find them.

Contingent faculty now makes up 70% of university faculty, up from 30% like 40 years ago or so, and the trend doesn't seem to be slowing.\n\nSooooooo....", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rnbewr/phd_or_law_school/hps1n20/"}, "4892": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BeefJerkyForSpartan", "Date": 1640326149, "Score": 1, "Body": "Lol take it easy dude.

If the contribution of my paper is a new technique, then I need to think a lot about the new technique, reading lots of papers that will help me with that. \n\nSo, when I'm reading papers, I always keep in mind how those papers can help me to develop my paper. And which papers are more important to develop my own paper. I try to start with papers from top journals and papers which are most heavily cited. \n\nLet's say, for example, that my research idea is to prove that X influences Y, and that relationship is moderated by Z. In that case, I may adopt a strategy like this:\n\n\\- Read the most important papers about X (how it is defined, how it is measured, etc.)\n\n\\- Read the most important papers about Y (how it is defined, how it is measured, etc.)\n\n\\- Think about why X might influence Y, and then read papers that would help me to explain that. \n\n\\- Think about why Z might moderate the relationship between X and Y, and then read papers that would help me to explain that. \n\n\\- Check which techniques or methodologies would be appropriate for my research idea. \n\nIt is a lot of reading, but always with the strategy in mind. Oftentimes, I can quickly see that a paper won't help me with any part of my strategy, even if it is related to my topic.

Sometimes it's something very logical, natural, intuitive. People probably wouldn't argue against that. In that case, it doesn't make sense to have 50 papers to explain that. \n\nOn the other hand, sometimes there are parts of my research idea that need a lot of support.

You could blow the whistle right now, and as you have said, a lot of people would probably either not believe you, or think that you are just misinterpreting his actions. Additionally, he will also have his defense, which I\u2019m sure will sound reasonable, especially with his reputation and standing at the school.

Document everything as others have said, but also ensure it is time stamped (e.g., email to your .edu account, even if it\u2019s a written diary, take a picture of it and email or text it daily/weekly).

You have no obligation to gather any evidence whatsoever, the fact that you feel sexually harassed should be enough, but we have all seen one too many times that it often results in anything but a slap on the hand, or vilifying the victim. Be very specific in documenting as well, don\u2019t generalize experiences, state exactly what happened and when, and how it made you feel. Not only will this solidify your case and convince others, but it will also allow you to see clearly that he is indeed targeting or trying to groom you, so there is no question in your mind like there is now. In being objective and specific, perhaps you even come to the conclusion that it\u2019s all just accidents (though I\u2019m sure you will indeed prove otherwise).\n\nDefinitely do not leave without bringing this up. If you decide to wait until you\u2019re done with your PhD because you don\u2019t feel physically threatened and want to make sure you get it, I don\u2019t blame you one bit, but please don\u2019t just leave without saying anything, someone else could be next. \n\nI wish you the best, and again, please do confide in someone you trust sooner than later.

At least this has been my perspective on it, it may have different mileage for others.\n\nAnyways, my perspective, for the biologist (molecular, cellular, genetics, etc.), the paradigm for the last about 30 years has been relying on finding and exploring individual genes. \"Gene X has these phenotypic outputs in these systems.\" Over time, it's gotten more complex, but still focusing on the individual genes. I mean, the reality is that you can only create so many knock-out mice before the whole thing becomes unstable.\n\nBioinformatics just was one of the hot new ways of \"exploring\" which genes to find. And by genes, I mean the \"individual favorite gene\" that a lab may have invested into to make sure it's relevant. The results in some population or whatnot says that *this* gene is the most important.\n\nOf course, that's an idiotic way of looking at it. Signaling pathways are highly compensatory in most cases, things are messy, and shutting down or looking at one gene or a few genes isn't approaching the problem. But the investments of biologists and institutions like the NIH on genes has resulted in this very mantra. Looking for \"needles in haystacks\" and \"favorite genes\" on these individual processes. And there's a palpable lack of success in translation that can be stemmed from expectations from large genetic screens and such that have been done which have not even come close to solving some of our biggest problems. That's not to say it hasn't been useful; rather, that it's been a lot harder than biologists *thought* it would be to solve these issues using that way of thinking.\n\nBut it propagates because the next generation of scientists are pushed by the previous generation in this direction. It's encouraged actively, because it's been a train of thought for so long. \n\nPersonally, at least in my postdoc, I became much less interested in this direction of thinking. It simply was becoming just foraging of data which I had no idea whether it had any real substance. Nice way of publishing a paper, but horrible way of dictating what the next thing to do in your research was because it always turned out to be far riskier than expected. But that's just my interpretation of it all and what I was working on.\n\nMeanwhile, complex modeling by bioinformaticians have different expectations and outputs that simply don't spit out a gene. The disadvantage I'd say for most bioinformatics guys is the lack of wetlab realities and experience for what their findings may mean. At least that's coming from someone that did wetlab experiments for years.\n\nThis typically happens though, when you have two disparate fields forging together. It takes time to sort out, to sort of \"understand\" one another. But it requires new scientists I think to really sit down with their counterparts and sort of learn those worlds.

Maybe call the campus security to see how long they keep videos on file so you can time when/if you report him before they delete them.\n\nOne thing people will ask you is if you expressed discomfort or declined advances, and if not, why. This is obvious - he's your PI, maybe you feared retaliation. So you really don't have to feel like you must say something if you are very afraid. However, if he does it again, you may want to try just saying, \"That makes me uncomfortable,\" or \"I don't like that.\" Jump back and gasp, act all afraid, make a face, make a scene. Vomit on the floor. If you acknowledge what he's doing and act like it's a problem for you (which translates to a problem for him, the person he actually cares about), he will likely stop ASAP because he will sniff that you're a \"troublemaker\" and may report him later (and he'll be worried about all the other people witnessing it). BE A FUCKING TROUBLEMAKER. If he *doesn't* stop, then you can probably have him arrested for some type of sexual assault since it wasn't consensual (or when you go to the department, it is obvious it wasn't consensual).\n\nNo one really accidentally touches people like that. If he says, \"That was an accident,\" then look at him directly in the eyes and say, \"Be more careful then. I do not like that.\" Don't excuse it because it was an accident! If you do, he will say it's an accident every time because he knows that excuse works.\n\nIf he stands in your bubble, step back from him. Like deliberately each time.

Some people escape this, due to the nature of their topics i.e. they can conduct their work with a small amount of resources, aren't necessarily tied to the university for instance if thier work is simulation based. Others go through hell because they do require physical resources which sometimes the university isn't well planned to supply causing stress but as the department doesn't want to sully its name they brow beat students into silence.

Shouldn't we compare ourselves to students who are having to pay tuition and other expenses the entire 4 years of their degree program (bachelor's or PhD or whatever)?\n\n\nWe (I am a PhD student in the US as well) are students. So ideally we are here to learn and typically one has to pay to learn. Think of all the money one would spend on tuition, books, lodging, etc as a student. As a PhD student who's funded, we're getting all that (full tuition reimbursement, discounted lodging, discounted food, several travel expenses reimbursed) plus a stipend. It's not a salary. So maybe we shouldn't compare our stipend to a job's salary?\n\n\nAlso, I'd say we are not being asked to work. We do research to learn. It's a desire to learn and publish and progress. We do it to get a well paying job in the future. Typically, we choose how many hours you put in every day while doing our PhD. One can choose to not to be overworked and take it easy. The disadvantage (unfortunately) is that it'll take longer to publish and someone else may publish the same idea. So it's the competitive nature of research and the drive to finish faster is what makes one overworked. That's just the nature of any work/school in society, isn't it?\n\n\nSo i think it's a mindset.

Some thoughts from my own experiences:\n\n1. Dont just ask current students, ask former students. When doing so, be wary that they will have biases, so take their words as suggestions for things to look for but not necessarily expect. Many former students from my current lab talk about how the PI was chill, but if they left before each chapter was fully published their relationship soured quickly. Wish I knew that before getting in, but it's something I can now work towards mitigating when the time comes. Edit: As an additional example and comparison, I knew two female students that claimed their former PI was sexist. Other women from the lab (include a trans woman) were there at the same time as these two and strongly disagreed and went to the PI's defense against the formal allegations. Sexual harrassment is definitely present in higher education, so never take the accusations lightly. Getting the perspectives from just one group would clearly bias the impression one would get of this PI, so check around if you hear any rumors because views will vary. You'll have to come to those judgements yourself though.\n\n\n2. If it's a lab you're really interested, like one of your top choices, ask them about where they see the project going after you finish. This shows interest beyond your tenure there and may help you when formulating your own project. My current PI loved it when I asked that and I honestly think it helped me get the position in the end.\n\n\n3. What is their writing/editing process? My PI is painfully methodical. First is Methods, then Results, Intro, Discussion. Each is written in order and does not like moving on to the next section until the previous one is done to satisfaction. My first manuscript literally took 2 years to write from start to finish because of this. During that period the central thesis shifted multiple times inevitably making the whole thing feel more clunky than necessary. When you have your 'story', write it down in full, even if just as an outline, so you know how the manuscript should flow.\n\n\n4. How much background do they have in your specific area of interest? Most of the time this probably wont be an issue, but it can be. I came in to my PhD with an interest more in genetics, but my PI was focused on niche and ecological modeling. Because of this, despite having genotype data of over 2000 animals, I was denied access to that data for half a year to focus on developing a tracking project for a movement ecology study - something I had no experience in. The reason for this was because both my PI and the post-doc I worked alongside had little genetics experience and therefore did not see much use for the genotype data beyond ID purposes. Now my entire thesis revolves around identifying matrilineal lineages across a multi-ploidy system of all-female predominantly clonal hybrids. &lt;- How does that not scream genetics study? Point being, their suggestions may fall more inline with their expertise, not necessarily yours.\n\n\n5. How well do they work with other profs on campus? Save this question for their students or even other profs on campus (might as well chat with them as well), but it can help inform you on their ability to adjust their way of thinking. Being too stubborn can lead to fallout which can impact the students. During my MSc, I had to get access to local wildlife refuges and sanctuaries and the like. They all either had heard of, or had experiences with, my then PI and were all VERY reluctant to work with me by proxy. The same was true with the other profs on campus. Their burned bridges became my obstacles.\n\n\n\n6. What is their policy on going to conferences? Outside of the whole COVID thing and the want to reduce emissions in general, even virtual conferences are useful. My current PI is adamant that he WILL NOT PAY for more than one conference a year, and that's only if we have a paper that is close to finished for advertising purposes. In almost 4 years I have done 3 virtual conferences, two of which were free. During my MSc I did 2 solo back-to-back in-person conferences and went to 2 others with the lab in the course of 3 years, each of which my then PI paid for.\n\n\n\n7. If this requires field work, what is the food/accommodations payment policy? For my field work, we go out on a small island for weeks at a time and have to pay for our own food. It f-ing sucks.\n\n\n\n8. General lab bonding. This will vary depending on the students in the lab as well, but a PI can help to foster these connections. My previous PI was decent at having lab get togethers at his place for various reasons, typically for either entering students or graduating students so like one or two a year, but that was good to help us meet up and connect. A few times we even had sushi nights when he would prep fish they caught from that days dive! I have multiple friends from then I still keep in regular contact with 4 years later. Compared to current lab where the only get togethers we have are for weekly lab meetings for someone to just discuss their recent progress (note: there are 15 students in this lab, with distinct specialization groups within). Multiple times new faces would show up with little to no introduction, once we even had to ask who this new student was AT THE END OF THE MEETING because our PI completely forgot. I feel I hardly know any of my labmates even 4 years on.\n\n\n9. What is their \"teaching style\"? Do they micromanage or give you a loose leash? Do they encourage exploration of novel ideas or do they want you to stick to already prescribed theory? Both of my PIs have done well for me in this area, giving me a loose leash and allowing me to explore things and change direction when I saw fit. Sometimes it took a while to convince them, but in the end my ideas were often validated. And when needed, I think they were generally good at reigning me in from going overboard. But each student has their own way to advance, so be sure you know yourself before just saying \"either way is fine\".\n\n\n10. What are their expectations for other lab duties? My current lab (15 or so students) has no lab manager. We are often finding things are misplaced or not cleaned, partly because there are four different lab spaces to work in, three of which provide equipment storage. Our freezer space is almost completely full because no one has emptied out material from projects that are over a decade old. One time when cleaning out a freezer I found a complete bear head from before the turn of the century sitting BELOW multiple bags of apples I later learned our PI meant to make cider out of... Recently we were sent an email requesting us to each take on various tasks such as maintaining the freezer space, lab webpage maintenance, lab advertising videos, etc. These are the job of a lab manager, not the damn students.\n\n\nIf more come to mind I might add to this, but here's a final word for now. Recognize that PIs are still human and each have their own faults. Part of being a grad student is learning how to deal with them in all their foibles. While I would generally say neither of my PIs have been great, they each had some positives that I could easily point to and say \"that helped\". That said, I also know that multiple students have come out worse-for-ware from both of them, with one having diagnosed PTSD from their experience. I dont think anyone comes out of grad school unscathed, but you can come out stronger and your PI has a big part to play in that. They need to be a good fit for you, otherwise you will be hurt. The best guide for knowing if a PI is right for you is making sure to KNOW YOURSELF FIRST.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ro0oiv/im_currently_looking_for_a_phd_talking_to/hpxj439/"}, "5278": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Dragroundfly", "Date": 1640451748, "Score": 38, "Body": "Of course !

I experienced similar situation. I started my PhD in STEM in Winter 2020 in Montreal, and I just passed my proposal exam (comprehensive exam) four days ago. In my case, I decided to delay my exam from January to December as I wanted to focus on a side project and one conference paper (which was unfortunately rejected). Often, my panic striked time to time, whenever I see some of my colleagues, who started a semester or two after me, already had their paper accepted for conference this year while I got nothing and fell behind schedule.\n\nMy five cent tips for you would be \"don't be hard on yourself\". PhD is not a race and you are here to horn your research skills. Keep in mind, slow progress is still a progress. I understand you have time pressure to complete your PhD in 4 years, and so do I.\n\nOur cases may not be far different, and I think it is normal to have this little panic when you see your peers progressing. From my observation in my research group, I think everyone has this same feeling after one year of literature review. Of course, there are people who manage to publish papers less than a year, but we are not in a race with them. This worried feeling, on a bright side, I think it is a good thing because for now you will work more. At the same time, you are just one year (and a half) in your program. In a year, you managed to complete the mandatory courses, so this is a huge milestone for you already.\n\nIf I compare your situation to mine and my colleagues, majority of my colleagues have not completed their five courses requirement yet, let alone the comprehensive exam. It took me 2 years to complete 5 mandatory courses and one extra course due to my interdisciplinary research. So overall you are doing a good job for yourself.\n\nIf you are not in a position to have publication/papers or do any side project, then your priority would be to complete your proposal and defend your proposal in the coming Winter 2022. After that, you can fully focus on your publication.

In general (and I get that this is going to sound harsh, but if you've made a decision to do a PhD and are thinking of dropping out after the first semester, then you're going to need to sort your feelings out very quickly):\n\n- Just because you enjoy research doesn't mean you should do a PhD.\n\n- You have other means of doing research. A Masters is a perfectly acceptable route that gives those options as well, especially in Industry.\n\n- If you like bigger picture aspects, designing experiments, and pushing ideas forward, then the PhD is more applicable.\n\n- If you DO NOT enjoy these things, then 4-6 years of going through this is not for you.\n\n- I keep hearing the money and vacation aspects. Look, guys, I get it, you aren't making a lot of money being a grad student. But think of it the other way around: you're getting a fully paid opportunity to learn and pursue a degree rather than paying for this out of pocket. Yes, it's \"paid off\" by you doing work, but this isn't like med school or a Masters where you're having to pay your way through and being in debt. If you're taking a pay cut from industry, I get it, but then *you needed to have thought this through before you committed rather than complain about it after having gotten into the program*. That said *lifestyle choices are important, and it may not be for you.* I would just frame it this latter way rather than admonishing it in a way that makes everyone seem idiotic for deciding to do a PhD while getting paid poorly.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t know if any of this makes sense, but part of me wants to stick it out because I want to be able to call myself doctor and lead very innovative R&amp;D research in the future...\n\nIt's interesting that you put the \"doctor\" part first here. Admittedly, that might be a bit too much psychoanalysis, but the *absolute worst reason to get a PhD is so that people can call you \"doctor.\"* \n\nBecause, frankly, people won't call you that. It's a title, you get to get some magazine subscriptions that way, but in the end of the day, the degree is an means towards a greater end.\n\n&gt;Sometimes all of the work feels pointless, as I could be working, making better money, taking trips/enjoying my life, and gaining experience in industry. It just feels like I\u2019m already burnt out and I haven\u2019t even really started yet. \n\nWhat is most important to you?\n\nFor me, during my PhD, the most important part for me was truly the work I was doing. I loved learning, coming up with new ideas, exploring ridiculous avenues of research. I loved talking about it with friends, telling them cool ideas I had or tried out, had these crazy fucking stories about the different things we were finding.\n\nYears later, now being in a job and getting to relax, I look at that past fondly. I don't regret the hard times (especially towards the end), I don't feel poorer for it. It helped shaped my experience.\n\nThat's not for everyone. Some people absolutely despised the PhD, hated every moment of it. Many went in for very short-term or misguided goals. Sometimes, their lives changed in the middle. The people that shifted out of it because it wasn't for them usually didn't regret leaving. The people that stayed and hated it often were filled with regret.\n\nBut you need to really answer that. What is most important to you? What do you want? What is it that you want your life to be focused on?\n\nAnd be honest. Yes, it's ok to say you want to make money and go on vacations and just enjoy it. That the research and everything isn't what you wanted. It's perfectly acceptable. But you need to really seek that answer out.\n\nAnd once you do, you need to plan accordingly.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rp8mig/advice_on_whether_i_should_stay_in_my_phd_program/hq3x89o/"}, "5566": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Daejik", "Date": 1640578700, "Score": 2, "Body": "My primary concern is being too early and not having much opportunity to leverage my skills.

Systematic means several things: \n\n* it's objective (you can't just choose studies because you want to, else it's a narrative review),\n* you should have pre-specified criteria for exclusion/inclusion before looking at the resulting papers (else, people would say \"oh you added this criteria to not include my study because you don't like me)\n* try to be two people at least (so you can see if you have the same results)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my case, I created a query as \"broad\" as possible and look for papers on PubMed (save that query somewhere, with the date it was made/searched, it's very important). The query generated 7,000 results. All those results were put in an excel file, with an additional column \"Accepted/Rejected\".\n\nI sorted those results using criteria that I defined prior sorting (to keep consistency, and remind myself of the boundaries): is it in english, is it on the disease that I am interested in, is it on human infections. For each criteria, I wrote a description so that in 6 months, if someone asked \"why this paper is not included?\", I could say \"Because of criteria X, which says the paper did not have X or Y\". Believe me, it's very helpful to keep track of those criteria, especially for yourself. \n\nEach of these criteria was applied like a funnel sorting (starting from the largest one, i.e. language, to the most precise one, i.e. human infection here). If a paper reached the 3rd criteria, it must be that it passed the previous ones, and was therefore in english and about the disease of interest. Obviously, it is impossible to ask someone to read the full content of 7,000 papers, especially when most of them are not useful for your studies (hence the sorting/filtering). Use the title and abstract for that.  \n\n\nFor instance, using the title and abstract:   \n\n\n1. is it in English? No -&gt; Write \"Not in english\" in \"Accepted/Rejected\"\n2. Yes, is it about X disease? No -&gt; Write \"Not about X\" in \"Accepted/Rejected\"\n3. Yes, is it about human infections? No -&gt; Write \"Not about human infections\" in \"Accepted/Rejected\"\n4. Yes, include for full reading.\n\nFrom the 7,000 results I got from PubMed, I got only \\~500 papers that passed the criteria, so \\~500 papers to read full content. You can remove some inside those remaining ones AFTER reading the full content, but use criteria that you specified for that, so that it is not purely subjective. After reading the eligible ones, I got only 95 papers of interest, that I summarized -&gt; it is here that you will take out the main ideas and the very specific points of each paper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end, you have an excel file telling you how many results you got from what query, how many you removed because of each criteria, how many you have fully read, how many you removed because they were out of topic after fully reading them, how many you included. You can even make your own prisma flow diagram for that (look for it if you don't know what it is, it might help you). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, don't worry you got it, we've all been through this, but it is very helpful!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rpr6na/how_to_structure_the_literature_review_matrix/hq9k5rf/"}, "5711": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LithiumAmericium93", "Date": 1640691591, "Score": 10, "Body": "Lol you're not going to get anyone to critique that first one for free.

He is now very happy with his research and never talks about classes again. If you don\u2019t have an advisor yet, try to get in touch with some \u2018nice\u2019 professors, they may be helpful. Within your institution, I\u2019m sure there are grad clubs, organizations for grad students or international students that can also be a greatly helpful resource.\n\nWork on improving time management.

Most programs believe you already have the necessary  intelligence to succeed, therefore it's mostly about getting you to do things the way they want. You're taught what the important topics of study are, the best methods to study them, and how to present your findings. All of these parameters have emerged out of particular cultural, economic, and historical contexts and do not necessarily represent objective intellectual and scientific consensus. \n\nEven in STEM fields, there are often a lot of value judgements made about methods, techniques, topics, etc. that have more to do with a scholar's ego or preference than anything else. Essentially, most professors want us to be miniature versions of themselves, however narrow-minded that might sometimes be.  I've known professors who insist that PhD students need to spend every waking hour in the lab, because that's what was expected of them when they were PhD students. The experiments aren't necessarily better, the results aren't more valid, it's just some bizarre expectation that killing yourself makes you a better scientist.\n\nTruthfully, there is very little evidence that completing a PhD makes a person more competent or intelligent in anything but a very narrow area of specialization. For example, people with PhDs in Political Science are actually worse at predicting political outcomes than people without. Ultimately we learn a lot about specific topics, but who's to say that makes us smarter? For the most part it just means we got good at jumping through a certain set of strange hoops.\n\nFor me, these kinds of unreasonable expectations are what have been the biggest source of stress. I'm in a social science field, so I'm not expected to be in a lab, but I'm still expected to spend an absurd amount of time on my work. In order to do everything necessary to be considered \"successful,\" I basically need to forget about anything else in my life besides research. I have a friend who will graduate on time, and almost certainly get a tenure-track position, but she's only managed it by getting less than five hours sleep a night for the past four years.\n\nAt the end of the day, I ended up having to make a choice and prioritize my own health and wellbeing. It was difficult though, because that choice effectively shut me out of academic jobs, because I haven't done nearly enough to be competitive for them. I'm lucky in that my degree is easily portable outside of academia, but plenty of people aren't so lucky. So at the end of the day, I don't think leaving a PhD means a person is less intellectually able or lacks the mental resilience necessary to succeed. In many cases it might mean the opposite if they are choosing a path that won't lead to a nervous breakdown or total financial ruin.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rp03ll/when_is_it_a_good_idea_to_excuse_mental_stress/hqdvbj2/"}, "5886": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "GalwayGirlOnTheRun23", "Date": 1640766430, "Score": 10, "Body": "Be ready for questions at the end.

This isn't med school where every minute of your life is mapped with appropriate branch points. \n\nYou are the arbiter of your own fate. That's both terrifying and exciting at the same time.\n\nBut it means you need to determine what that fate actually entails. What you may think is important may not be what your mentors think are worth pursuing. \n\nAnd that's ok. That's encouraged. \n\nThat also takes time to figure out. It makes no sense to mindlessly do experiments, and is more important to figure out whether what you're doing adds to what you want to do after the fact. \n\nTake the time to figure this out earlier, not later. You should be thinking about this pretty regularly once you're doing lab work, and seeking opportunities accordingly.\n\n- Take advantage of opportunities\n\nGrad school especially is the time to take risks, and to learn *how* to take risks. Usually you have more protection during this period (especially compared to a postdoc or an industry job) to take on risks.\n\nBut learning *how* to take those risks are also important. I've seen a lot of people fuck this up, especially when they hit the postdoc, because of either putting too many eggs in one basket or because they put a bit too much stock in their \"luck\" that something \"should\" be happening.

They leave out that (a) after they worked 26 hours straight (which usually entailed a nap), that they took the *next two days off*. Or that they had discreet experiments, that was followed by a day at the library (because Pubmed didn't exist). Or that their publications were after a year or two of work followed by 4 figures with 4 panels apiece.\n\nYou know that advice about how to get a job? You sit in those forums of 5 or 6 people telling you what worked for them. They tell you they worked really hard. Then you find out that they left out some important parts of that story, like that their neighbor was working in a company and had an in, or that their family member played golf with the department head to get that interview, or that there was some hanky panky going on between Prof. A and Prof. B.\n\nThis happened much less during grad school and a lot more during my postdoc I found, but it's something you hear all over the place.

To tell you the truth I've been severely struggling with my research productivity as well because of all this baggage for years, and I am not close to completion. It's just that there is quite obvious judgement from my peer group, advisor and a general sense of \"You don't deserve to be here\" lurking around, which I can easily gather from social cues. Even the sympathy from colleagues seem patronizing. I just posted it here because i feel like anonymity allows people to speak freely and reddit hits the sweet spot, where people can speak freely but are not downright mean for the sake of being mean(usually). It reassures me a bit that at least some people feel its not downright insane to continue(yes, there are people who'd say its not very prudent to take advice from random people on the internet, but idk, i feel its closer to reality than most real \"friends\" are...).\n\nI think i still continue because, not in any particular order:\n\n1. Sunk cost fallacy.\n2. Social status of the degree, where the inner dynamic of how miserable the program was is effectively hidden from the rest of the world once you complete it.\n3. relics of Sophomore ideas of being knowledgeable in my field and working on problems associated with it.\n4. Financial stability. I do know i have the option to Master out, but I am not sure about my job prospects at this time. I am actively trying to get one, and situation might change if i do get one.\n5. Dropping out is seen very badly in our culture, especially since I came all the way around the world to get this degree, so going back without it really looks bad- socially.\n6. General comfort with this kind of misery. I know this misery, however uncomfortable, and change is scary, even with misery.\n\nWhy I shouldn't continue:\n\nI don't deserve it. This is not some subjective depression laced imposter syndrome, but I genuinely don't. My advisor is simply too good of a person to let me go like that, and cites \"emotional bond\" over the years to keep continuing with me. It is essentially pity, and lack of a machinery and/or heart to throw me out at this point.\n\nThe point is if I should continue with full objective awareness that I am undeserving.

Your situation right now is being dictated by personal emotions and battles, which is made more understanding by your post.\n\nI'm asking what you were looking for because it wasn't clear, not because it's a judgment on you. There's not much advice to be had here other than you need to get your shit together. And that's really not impossible; whatever screw-ups happened in the past is the past. You're given a path forward, and you can take advantage of that. Programs don't invest because of a sympathy on a person unless they are to get something out of it all. So clearly you have enough clout or ability or what have you to continue, otherwise they would have done whatever they could to kick you out.\n\nBut as mentioned earlier, your problems don't go away when you leave academia. Entering the working world is a whole other battle of \"imposter syndrome\" and what have you. And there's not a whole lot of protection either.\n\nDo you \"deserve\" to continue? I don't think that's actually the right question at all, because it actually doesn't make any sense. What does this even mean? \"Deserve\" to continue on a PhD? The PhD isn't some luxury status, it's not like you're in some social program. Your program has criteria for you to stay or go, and you would have been expunged if you were not satisfactory to stay. The same goes for the entire \"imposter syndrome\" thing going around. If you weren't smart enough to be in the program, you would have been kicked out already, that simple.\n\nI think there's a more difficult question you need to ask that really hits at it: Are you happy being in the program and doing the work you're doing? Do you have something else you want to do? How much more do you need to do in order to finish?\n\nThat, admittedly, is a very scary question.

Tech leader here, with PhD in the appropriate field.  Sounds like I'm very close to what you're aiming at, career-wise.\n\nIf you want a PhD, *go for it*!!  That said, very very few people need a PhD in this field.  I think you'll have about the same degree of difficulty transitioning into a relevant industry role with a PhD as with a Masters.  It's about learning how to select projects with a high likelihood of success, and figuring out what team members and expertises you need around you in order for your project to succeed.\n\nThe biggest roadblocks I've hit in my career are lack of executives (who initiate projects and control funding) who understand even the basics of the relevant tech. They design projects that cannot ever succeed, and then hire a bunch of appropriate MS and PhD engineers who enthusiastically claim it can be done anyways.  4 years and $5-$25M and several rounds of chopped heads later, and the project is a hot potato that has been handed off to several other junior executives and the company is just trying to pretend that all never happened.\n\nSo, during the course of my post-PhD career, I've ended up focusing on designing the projects myself, and actually, designing the entire business entity myself.  Because the ML will never succeed if there's problems elsewhere in the company.  And companies have an ugly habit of blaming the ML for all company problems.  (User turnover too high?  Must be bad ML, we need better ML.  Marketing costs too high?  Must be bad ML, we need better ML. Product development delays?  Obviously bad ML...)\n\nExcept for FAANGS and some financial institutions, I don't think I've ever talked to a company where MS/PhD made a difference for an advertized role, regardless of what the ad said.  (High level roles often aren't advertized, but that's a separate issue.)\n\nSo: I don't think 'reassuring an employer' is a helpful perspective.  It's tech, they'll hire anyone that's cheerful and can turn on a computer.

Furthermore, a master's degree and thesis tends to be far more extensive work in comparison to the undergraduate thesis.

This is that you work towards.

With a corporate career that included several business fields, but finance was the main one. \n\nBut I was getting tired of the corporate world, where I felt like I was fighting alone to make things better. With my experience, I thought maybe my time and life would be better used to help other people. \n\nI started teaching and after some time the school asked me if I would be interested in doing a master of science, as the school had support available for that. \n\nMy master of science was in finance, and I had to choose something to study. But there wasn't much left in finance that excited me. On the other hand, my experience showed how other fields seemed to be too disconnected from finance. Including HR and Marketing. \n\nI decided to study the financial impact of marketing actions. I had worked in marketing too, I  saw that a lot of times they didn't know what the heck they were doing. I tried to make things better but, honestly, I think I didn't know what the heck I was doing either. The corporate world sometimes don't really allow us to understand, they want quick results, they don't care that much if you know what you're doing or not. \n\nAnd that had bothered me for a long time. Huge amounts money invested and wasted. Many ethical issued. So, doing a masters was an opportunity to go back to that problem, and see what I could do about it. \n\nDuring the process, I saw that people in finance don't really care about that. But marketing people do. So, even with my masters being in finance, the end result was a marketing paper.\n\nNow I'm 48 years old, doing the last year of a marketing PhD, on the research tracks of quantitative marketing and marketing strategy. I study brand equity, which is related to finance. And it is also related to HR in the form of employer brand equity. \n\nPeople say I'm quite different from many PhDs for several reasons. One of them is that I'm the big picture type of person. I investigate connections between marketing, finance, HR, and other fields. Given my interests and background, narrowing the field too much (as typically expected for PhDs) wouldn't make much sense.\n\nNow, there are some challenges with the process. \n\nFor example, you said you \"always had an itch that I should be doing research.\" Then, a big question will be: why did you wait so long to scratch that itch? It's easy to think it is just an itch, and not something you would be seriously committed to. Schools are often worried about the impact of doing a PhD for someone like you. They don't want to take someone out of a successful corporate career and take them into an academic career to be unsuccessful. Doing a PhD is often a big sacrifice for someone successful. For example, living on stipend after making a lot of money tends to weight heavily as the years go on during the PhD. So, you need to think if that's really what you want to do, and how you're going to convince schools of that. \n\nAnother concern is that oftentimes people from the corporate world have no idea how academic research works. I see people trying to see their corporate experience, maybe involving some type of research, as something valuable to do a PhD. But, if they are not careful, it just seems they don't understand the differences between academia and industry. \n\nSo, to convince potential supervisors, I think you need to be sure about what exactly you want to do (and that can take a masters or at least some heavy reading of research until you have research ideas developed on our mind), find evidence of commitment to research and academia, show that you understand what you're getting into. You may also have a hard time getting letters of recommendation from professors, if you have been out of school for a long time and people don't remember you. \n\nWith degrees in computing and finance, I'm sure you should have plenty of knowledge and skills to show. You would still need to present your GPAs, GRE/GMAT scores, and things like that. But those wouldn't be my main concerns.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rs05k3/narrowing_down_a_field_for_a_late_starter/hqjgndu/"}, "6301": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "kmhuds", "Date": 1640868425, "Score": 2, "Body": "A lot of PhD programs have prerequisites for applying to the program, like certain college courses already taken or minimum scores on whatever standardized tests.

Your cover letter should make a case that you\u2019ll be good in a community college specifically- include information about student evaluations if you have any, and make a case that you\u2019re interested in teaching a diverse student body to show that you understand the CC\u2019s population is a bit different than your PhD institution\u2019s.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rsqogj/teaching_at_a_local_community_college_in_the/hqq5xcs/"}, "6545": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "muvicvic", "Date": 1640986141, "Score": 7, "Body": "I like Muji\u2019s unlined notebooks.

Live like a frugal local. Cultivate and visit friends and collaborators who live in interesting places.\n\nHousing - stay with friends or camp (socially or adventurously rewarding). Use youth hostels if available. Sleep in airports if desperate. \n\nFood - grocery stores or working-mans-cafes. It can be culturally interesting to try local brands.\n\nLocal travel - take public transit or walk. I like walking in foreign cities, you see a lot.\n\nActivities - travel slow, get a local friend to show you around if at all possible. Walk around interesting areas, make conversation with strangers, do free nature things like hikes and picnics. If you pay entrance fees for something, make time to linger, absorb, and engage deeply. Museums and national parks are great for this.\n\nAir travel - try to tack vacations onto reimbursable (or at least tax-deductible) work trips: conferences, invited talks, visits to collaborators, fieldwork, whatever you've got\n\nAir travel (if you can't get reimbursed) - buy the cheapest Tuesday/Wednesday tickets and don't pay for \\*any\\* add-ons like seat selection. Inflatable pillows, water bottles, and snacks to make it suck a bit less. \n\nLuggage - collect *tiny,* multi-purpose travel items. Useful things include collapsible water bottles, micro travel-towels, and thin-but-warm clothes in neutral colors that you can mix and match. The goal is to have everything you need for a week fit in one under-the-seat (free! easy to carry!) bag.\n\n...Of course, some of these tips are uncomfortable or inconvenient, and if you have extra money you'll want to spend more. I like to feel like I'm *choosing* the luxuries that I most like, not defaulting to the ones that the tourist industry wants me to have.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/rs6svq/saving_money_during_a_phd/hqqk5t2/"}, "6551": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "fantasticsky_hng", "Date": 1640990359, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank you so much.
