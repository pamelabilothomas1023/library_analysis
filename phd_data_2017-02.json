Below, we explain why this is important to everyone (not only scientists!), and how the community could create and maintain a new archive based on technology that is free and minimally resilient to (possibly) attacks from parties with interest in this business.\n\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nScientists learn from their first day on the job that anything they say will be scrutinized, reviewed, criticized. The whole point is to construct on top of previous knowledge. To make this work, scientific journals are peer-reviewed: upon a submission, peers review all claims made in a paper and evaluate whether the arguments presented are convincing.  This guarantees that any scientific paper published in a peer-reviewed journal has a minimal standard of quality. One of the problems with this system is that it costs money, and thus papers are usually made available behind a paywall. A little over than a decade ago, some people started to question why science should be behind a paywall, especially given that most of it are created by publicly funded institutions and projects. It was the start of the (peer-reviewed) Open Access Journals, which charge institutions and authors for publication fees, and then make scientific papers free to download.\n\nThis also ignited the emergence of journals with low standards, promising certainty of publication in exchange for a fee. Often, the peer-review process of such journals is, to say the least, questionable. In extreme cases, some publishers would use names that resemble those of reputable journals and try to fool some researchers. We refer to such practices as \"predatory.\" This practice not only harms the ideal of how science should be conducted, but also creates uncertainty as to which papers can actually be trusted when you are conducting your research.\n\nThis is what motived Dr. Jeffrey Beall in creating the Scholarly Open Access (scholarlyOA). As the good scientist that he is, Dr. Beall did not simply present a list of journals that he believed were predatory open access publishers; he also published, for each entry in his list, a blog post containing all the information that led him to believe that the journal or publisher should be on that list. Also, comments were open to everyone, and in many cases, people would either contribute with more evidence or explain and refute the presented evidence. In other words, this was a joint effort of a large scientific community. It is also worth commenting that, at least in a few cases, journals were removed from the list after observing an improvement from the publisher's end.\n\nEvidence is what drives scientists, and transparency is what makes a claim trustworthy. By presenting users with the evidence that would characterize a journal or publisher as predatory, scholarlyOA was leaving up to the scientists the final decision of trying to publish or not in the journals listed. It has not been confirmed that there were threats, or by whom. It is hard to believe, however, that the website would be removed without any notice to the community. Regardless, Editage reports that it is unlikely that scholarlyOA is changing host or being moved somewhere else.\n\n\n**How can we have a free web archive resilient to third-parties attack?**\n\nWe want to propose a method by which a project similar to scholarlyOA could be created and maintained by the people. From here on, we will use the term \"publisher\" to refer to both publishers or stand-alone journals. Here are the keystone aspects for such a system to work:\n\n* Maintainers must be anonymous.\n\n* Anyone, anywhere, must be able to replicate all records at any time, and be able to save a copy of the entire website locally.\n\n* For each candidate publisher to be included in the list, there must be an associated Evidence Page in which evidence is recorded.\n\n* Both evidence in favor and against the journal may be added to the Evidence Page.\n\n* Each evidence must be indexed by time. Records cannot be deleted, even. If anything changed, the change should be logged.\n\n* Anyone should be able to submit their evidence to the Evidence Page of all publishers; a code of conduct and ethics should apply.\n\n* Public comments should be allowed; a minimal code of conduct and ethics should apply.\n\n* Although numerical scores could be used, the ultimate decision whether to include the journal or not in the final list should be made by the maintainers.\n\n* In the actual list, it must be crystal clear (i) that the list represents probable predatory publishers and (ii) where the Evidence Page is for each record;\n\n\nBased on these guidelines, we believe that most of the key features from scholarlyOA will remain. Given that such information will be created by the community - and to the community -, replication of the data (second item) will likely ensure that the project is not discontinued (unless nobody is interested). And the anonymity of the maintainers, given the current level of security provided by privacy software, will likely mitigate possible lawsuits. In the event of a maintainer(s) being compromised, however, others could emerge.\n\nTo implement this idea, there are free options available that would satisfy all conditions above. We provide a few points below as to how.\n\n* Instead of using a hosting service, maintainers could create a git repository (e.g. on GitHub). Almost no knowledge will be required from users, as the web interface of all git services now provide embedded text editors.\n\n* No prior knowledge should be assumed from the users. In this regard, using a git repository seems ideal. All the webpages could be stored as markdown documents. Most git web services render markdown to HTML automatically.\n\n* In this sense, the actual list could be a file, and each associated Evidence Page would be a file linked from an entry of the list.\n\n* Anyone would be able to contribute to this archive by using Pull Requests. Because most of the git services hosted on the web do set up Pull Requests automatically, this does not require any prior knowledge from the users.\n\n* Issue tracking services can then be used to keep track of discussions related to any claim against a publisher. Github, for instance, has this feature implemented for free.\n\n* By cloning the repository, any user would be able to replicate the\n  entire website, including all evidence for each entry in the list.\n\n* Comments could be made in the Pull Request which originally added the publisher to the list. Alternatively, an Issue could be opened in the git project web page for each publisher, and comments would be added to the corresponding Issue.\n\n\nIn the idealized model presented above, even if the archive is shut down, anyone who has cloned the repository will be able to re-upload it. If GitHub is forced to block our repository by some legal decision, it might be sent to another git web host, or even to a self-hosted solution inside a Tor hidden node.\n\nAlthough comments in Issues or Pull Requests are not copied by cloning repositories, tools that backup all such data already exist, such as https://github.com/ejmr/save-github-issues.\n\nMirrors of the repository could also be created. In other words, this structure creates an inherently decentralized system from the start.\n\n\nWe hope people appreciate the importance of an archive such as scholarlyOA. If you have other ideas, better ideas, critics, then please comment. If you want to implement this, comment. Maybe this can go somewhere.

These experiences made me stand out from other PhDs and also the droves of MBAs applying. Most other PhDs I knew who applied to consulting were President of their school's Biotech Club. That was the extent of their experiences. Only one of these PhDs that I personally know got a FT offer in consulting. She'll be starting at McK soon. (Actually- I cased with the president of our biotech club. He got final rounds, but didn't receive any offers).  I had a funded startup, a summer internship at a notable VC firm and a clear interest and knowledge of business. I got these experiences because I took the initiative to find them. That's the type of person the top firms want. A person who is smart (that's evident in the graduate work), but also a go-getter who steps outside the box to do something interesting. At the firm that I'm joining- I waltzed through my first round interviews ( of my two interviews- one partner didn't even give me a case. We just shot the breeze for 45 minutes). Second rounds were a little harder, but still a breeze, because I was given unusually easy cases. Also, being likable and chill was extremely important and not a trait many PhDs I met on the interview trail had.
