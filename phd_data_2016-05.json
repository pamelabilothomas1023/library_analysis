However, at a doctorate level you are expected to bring new knowledge to the field you're studying. Doctorates are topic specific within a subject, in fact most research programme applications explicitly ask the candidates to demonstrate how their proposed research would be significant in terms of the contribution it would make to the knowledge of the field, at least that's how it works in the UK, in US I believe PhD is a 5 year full-time course, with the first two years essentially being a Master's programme as students are supposed to undertake course work and in the third year they develop their research plans based on the interests they have developed in the past two years or before that.

That is all ideal, in reality you may find that your topic changes and you end up with very little data. \n\nPhD life is strange. You are still technically a student, but you are not treated like one. It really hits home around year two where you will finish a days work and then feel guilty that you are not working in the evening. It never ends up being a 9-5, as it tends to loom over you. However, you can get some amazing experiences that very few people will. It's a real rollercoaster.\n\nAdvice for newbies? Love your topic. You will be slogging away at this and it will probably define your career. If you have only a passing interest, then it is not the right topic for you. Often you will be working on the very edge of knowledge and your supervisors will get to a point where you are far more up on your subject than them. \n\nFinal piece of advice: Do not ignore warning signs. Health (both mental and physical) take a beating. You get so wrapped up in your PhD that you get ill and you just dont think it's important because you have your thesis to finish. I ignored my decline in health and it almost killed me and I am sure I am not the only one that made the process harder by not sorting my health issues first.\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_4jqgwl.json"}, "100": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Grantmitch1", "Date": 1463579138, "Score": 2, "Body": "Utterly shameless self-promotion is utterly shameless. 10/10 would shame again. \n\nI read the article and while your research sounds, for want of a better word, weird, the article was interesting so thank you. \n\nWhat helps me is that my PhD research is an extension of my undergraduate and research master's work.

After freaking out a bit and writing this, I finally wrote a first draft. Then my professor and I scheduled a meeting to frame out the poster. The conference was last week. It actually all went much better than expected.

Have you talked to others in your program about these feelings at all? I found out recently that a lot of my friends were struggling internally as well, but no one talks about it.\n\nI think my main thought after reading your post is that believe me, you're not screwed. You're going to be ok, truly. The task ahead of you now, aside from actually finishing the thing (which you *can* do, though it will be hard), is to decide what you **want** to do after you're done.\n\nDo you want to continue in science? Forget about all your feelings of inadequacy. If you do, then you can start to think about how to put yourself back together emotionally so you can continue. Many, many successful scientists have felt this way. They just managed to keep on going and not give up.\n\nIf you feel you don't want to continue, that's ok too. Most of my friends decided this. There are a lot of other things out there. Once you've decided this (not that it's the easiest thing, you can give yourself a few months to think about it), then you can move forward.\n\nI agree with the other poster about finding a therapist/counselor to talk to. I really avoided this for a long time but it did help me a bit. The way in which it helped was to have someone force me to talk aloud about what I wanted and what I was afraid of, without getting stuck in my very negative thought loops. I am very critical of myself and have developed a lot of negative/pessimistic ways of seeing things during my time in grad school. Not that I have stopped entirely, but my therapist helped me put that aside for at least a few minutes so I could think about the way I wanted my life to go.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_4lukpm.json"}, "154": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sewballet", "Date": 1464736199, "Score": 1, "Body": "In addition to being really over it, it seems like you might be burnt out. For me wanting to curl up in a ball and hide from the world is a sign I have been pushing too hard for too long. Is it feasible for you to take a short break? A Sat/Sun/Mon long weekend - without working on your thesis *at all*? I find in these times I am able to recover some energy, and remember what I was enjoying and passionate about. Feeling depressed makes you less productive, which makes you feel depressed. It's a horrible vicious cycle, you might need to check out for a few days. Yesterday I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRFsuNczIjk) workshop - it is a bit cheesy but I found it overwhelmingly comforting, and much more practical than a lot of academic \"self help\", it might be useful to you.\n  \nI agree that it's important for you to turn your attention to what you *do* want, that way completing your thesis will be a stepping stone to a good place, and seem easier. Just 6 more months to go, wishing you all the very best. \n  ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_4lukpm.json"}}
