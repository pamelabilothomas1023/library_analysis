One of the things that attracted me to this program (which was one of my top choices btw) was the focus on social justice and multiculturalism. Specifically, I felt like I could do research with any of the faculty as they were all doing research that was a good fit for me. However, once I was actually in the program, it felt like the multicultural values they had espoused weren\u2019t what they actually practiced and I felt somewhat deceived by funding expectations (I thought I would be receiving more than I am). Basically, I find people in this program rude and inconsiderate which just adds to the already created financial stress. I have not found the faculty to be supportive and my cohort is a whole other issue. I loved my masters program (in the same field) and I had hoped to continue developing and learning in my PhD but unfortunately I feel that I\u2019ve done little of that. With psychology programs typically you must complete an internship (kind of like a residency that medical students go through) before graduation.

By research output they are top 10 for business in general (and very good for accounting as well). A \"good\" GMAT score is relative. If you have a good GPA, strong recommendation letters, research experience, etc., the GMAT matters less (but still matters). Average GMAT scores are above 700 these days for PhDs. For an accounting program they will focus more on the quant side (but you can earn easy points from the verbal side so don't neglect it). Aim for at least 700, but above that is better. \n\n2) Any PhD worth doing is going to be competitive. At a minimum you need to find one that is AACSB accredited. The second thing to look at is who will you be working with? Are there good professors? Publishing on topics you're interested in? Do they have placement records that make you think \"if I went to one of those I'd be happy\"? Besides what you mentioned the thing they look for is potential for becoming an academic researcher: past experience in research or signaling that you want to become a contributor to the field. Also for PhD programs I think UT Dallas is Ivy League level. The typical rankings for MBAs don't apply to PhDs, everything is about research output, and this is an area where UT Dallas excels. \n\n3) Talk to your current accounting professors and tell them you want to do a PhD. They are your best resources and the fact that you are interacting with them daily means you should make your intentions clear. If you really want to do a PhD at your current school they are the gatekeepers. If you want to do a PhD elsewhere they still matter because you need letters of recommendation.

Talk to professors and make connections for references and maybe get some research experience. All three letter should be from people who hold a phd and are active in research if possible so start talking to those people now. Also in accounting it's common to not have research experience but if you can get it then that's one more thing to make you stand out. \n\n2.  Rankings are difficult but there are some top schools for phd that isn't what you think. Harvard and Yale etc are ok but really places like UT Dallas, UNC, University of Illinois are the power houses. A good reference is UT Dallas ranking by journal and just choose the top 3 accounting journals to filter. Also BYU has a ranking based on subject but counts all journals even ones no one has heard of. Still great though you can see who is good in financial, managerial, tax and audit. \n\n3.  A phd anywhere is extremely difficult to get into even lower programs have around a 5% acceptance rate. Many schools post class profiles although it's usually for all the business programs still you can get a idea of if you are at least competitive. Many schools have an average gmat of 720 though and only admit between 1-3 people each year. These programs have great funding compared to other fields which is why it is so competitive. Most business phd students get free tuition and a $30k year stipend and healthcare so schools can only afford to admit a 1-3 students, whereas other social science have lower funding requirements and grant funding so they can have larger programs.

If you can identify one or two key things that affect you strongly, you might be able to work on changing them for something you find less stressful.

Have a look at something called the imposter syndrome and allow yourself a few hours to have a read about it. \n\nIn the first instance, I agree with the poster before me - there are professional counselors and therapists that are trained specifically to go through this with you and I'd really recommend setting up an appointment as a first step. You should be able to access this through your university and their benefit over us is that they'll see you on a continuing basis. \n\nIf you've made no progress and feel that your supervisors are disappointing with you, they have a responsibility as supervisors but also as functional adults, to convey this to you in a proper manner. If you haven't had a meeting with them where they've expressed this is proper wording, then it doesn't deserve the time that you've spent worrying about it. You cannot control how others may or may not act in that way and it's up to them to put their feelings out there if they're genuine. \n\nIf your supervisor is one such that you can talk to them about things outside of your project, a quiet word and perhaps telling them that you acknowledge you get anxious before meetings might help.

Write it, put it in an envelope and keep it on a shelf somewhere with a timer to say when to think about it. See how you feel after writing the letter.
