It depends on where you're interested in working in afterwards country-wise. Academia openings are rare and competitive in the US due to scarce funding at the moment. For any one faculty opening there's likely to be 100-200 applicants from what I heard in my department.\n\n2. As long as you have decent research experience, you'll be fine. Microbiology PhD programs in the US doesn't require you to have a Masters to apply. You can get in with a bachelor's but research experience is quite important.\n\n3. I don't know how true this is but one of my professors told me if the program doesn't offer funding, it's probably a crap school anyway. Most programs offer guaranteed funding for this field. It's typically RA but in the case that your boss is broke, you can usually TA for department funding.\n\n4. Application deadlines are usually in December. Latest you should take the GRE (required examination for PhD programs) by late October/very early November as it takes ~2-3 weeks or so to get your scores in time for your application. Take as much time as you can to study for the GRE. Start scouting the programs you're interested in and prepare your personal statements etc. You'll need to plan time to get your professors to review them for you if you want.\n\n5. You won't know till you're invited for interviews. You can then talk to different faculty members and get a feel about their lab. Even within the same program there's different lab cultures depending on the PI.
