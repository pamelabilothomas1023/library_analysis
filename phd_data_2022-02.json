Our household income throughout my whole life was under 25k USD. As a US citizen pursuing state schools, I received a lot of financial aid. Some was merit and some was because I was poor. I still had to take out some loans to pay for my education, albeit not many. I was working 3 part time jobs at one point during my undergraduate career to stay afloat financially. It definitely impacted my grades negatively. If I were to redo it, I would have rather taken out an extra 5k in loans instead of working so hard. I got my Bachelor\u2019s, then immediately my Master\u2019s, and after being in industry for 1.5 years I\u2019ll be entering my PhD. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is possible but not having family support makes the situation a lot more difficult. Basically no Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s is free in the US. There are exceptions, but most people pay out of pocket for those two to some extent. Most PhD programs, from what I\u2019ve seen, offer full tuition stipends and usually 15-35k USD for your time as a teacher. None of the programs mentioned will pay for your housing for you. If in a Master\u2019s, you have to get a job or loan to pay for housing. If in a PhD your teaching wages \u201cshould\u201d be enough for you to rent with some roommates. Be prepared to be low income for a decent chunk of time if you take the PhD program route. Not all programs pay for travel or accommodations for conferences or even research. My top program is very clear that we must pay for our own airfare to South America if we wish to do extra field research down there.\n\nEdit: To answer how higher education has changed my life: It has put me in touch with people who are at the top of their fields, which I am also passionate about.

As a result international applications from unknown universities will just not be considered further as time is very finite. There are a few ways to get through this first filtration anyway, but they are not easy:\n\n1) Work with and get a recommendation from somebody in the field you want to work. Ideally someone the PI you apply with knows.\n\n2) Compete (well) in an international programming competition. This does not only show that you can code but also and more importantly that you are able to tackle and solve complex problems in a short amount of time.\n\n3) Have a publication at a high rank international conference.\n\nTeaching videos sound like a stretch to me.

Having transitioned to the industry myself, I would like to share some thoughts to help others.\n\nI learned about CS in early 2020. I had been searching for a job for about half a year at that point, several companies I was interviewing with announced a complete hiring freeze and the whole situation looked rather gloomy. Needless to say, I was desperate and wanted to grasp every opportunity. Along came CS, I attended a webinar and signed up for the association and one of their \"advanced\" programs. I was aware that I was pressured into signing up (50% discount *only* then and there during the webinar), but a quick Google search turned up positive results.\n\nThe realization that the association offered very little value for money hit me when I opened the materials. I signed up for the data science track and what I got for about $500 (mind you this is the discounted price) was a couple of pdfs and videos just describing what data science is and a couple statistics. On the surface, it looks like a complete program with parts covering the foundations, the interview process and the career trajectory. However, there is very little in terms of data science-specific information, and it feels like generic material where you just replace the title and sell it as a different product. The \"advanced\" module (yes, that is advanced within advanced) is very much the same. You get several videos with different titles, even with different \"experts\" talking about the exact same things. If you jump through all the hoops you have the possibility to get certified by CS and display your certificate on LinkedIn. The certification is complete BS, you need to answer questions like \"Which sectors hire data scientist?\" You got some answers wrong? No worries, they email you the solutions and you can try again... I have to admit, having seen this from the inside, I would likely **not** take a second look at a CV listing anything related to CS.\n\nEven though I got hired in April 2020, giving in to the sunk cost fallacy, I attended some of their webinars, hoping that I might get something useful out of it. However, the only new piece of information I ever got from them was how to look up my LinkedIn score (Social Selling Index). All the more I learned was how much they try to pressure you into signing up for one (or more) of their programs. Fearmongering was real, they always painted the direst outlook of the job market, with a special focus on stating that you had absolutely no chance surviving in academia, and with signing up being your only chance at succeeding even in the industry. I have not attended their events since about summer 2021, but nonetheless they reached out to me cold recently if I wanted to sign up for their transition program. By the looks of it, nothing has changed and they still sell the same garbage for an ever higher price.\n\nI would like to echo that most of what CS is offering is out there in the public domain. The information is even well-curated, you will find many dedicated YouTube channels and career sites with resume writing guides, sample interview questions and tips and tricks for just about every step of the process.\n\nThe real issue is what the actual value added part should be. From what I can tell, the CS CEO has a \"my way, or the highway\" attitude to the hiring process. I would like to emphasize that this is wrong, and you cannot follow his advice to the letter. For example, one advice is never to put out any salary number, but let the company make an offer. It can happen that the interviewer wants to know if they can afford you and deferring the answer just makes you look like a dork. Depending on your personality, you may never have a good feel for these types of situations, but there are two things that can help you: real life practice and researching the specific position. You do not need CS for either.\n\nOverall, I feel that CS should be avoided. They really underdeliver on their promises and even if they offered a top quality service, they would be extremely expensive. You can get all the information they offer for free and then spend a couple hundreds on coaching, but your  school likely offers that for free as well. Attend meetups to practice talking to people and expand your network. Most things that make a job hunt successful are actually free, maybe get some business cards printed for in-person events.\n\n\\[edit: some typos\\]", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hgd2mv/my_opinion_on_cheeky_scientist_personal_job/hv4ppal/"}, "109": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jovnv", "Date": 1643722771, "Score": 2, "Body": "I think so too, but it gets the job done!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sh3jd4/overleaf_is_down/hv4pwx1/"}, "110": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "FeAuWoman", "Date": 1643723050, "Score": 1, "Body": "Hahaha no we make money but compared to what you could make in industry it\u2019s nothing.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/she2cs/my_phd_advisor_wants_me_to_finish_very_quickly_i/hv4qhs3/"}, "111": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "majinLawliet2", "Date": 1643723497, "Score": 0, "Body": "You have a great advisor!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/she2cs/my_phd_advisor_wants_me_to_finish_very_quickly_i/hv4rgrk/"}, "112": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SpeedyTurbo", "Date": 1643723889, "Score": 2, "Body": "But why?

You don\u2019t get paid to grade, though neither do professors, but you\u2019re often spending 2+ hours a night grading. If you\u2019re an English teacher you\u2019ll spend a lot more time on this than a math teacher, typically. Professors can sometimes get away with TAs grading or can be giving homework out on online platforms that grade for them. \n\nBeing a HS teacher you have to deal with parents, and boy are the parents ruthless. I was integrating newer, but proven, methods of teaching in my classroom and a parent who was a psychologist called multiple meetings to essentially break me down for not teaching like the \u201ctried and true\u201d teachers. Even after providing her with studies she wouldn\u2019t stop calling endless meetings. \n\nIn a HS teacher position you have to be a behavioral management super star. If you\u2019re teaching an AP or upper level class, the students tend to genuinely care about the subject. If you\u2019re teaching the \u201cremedial\u201d (even though it\u2019s not called that anymore in most places) or average student classes behavioral management is absolutely critical. I\u2019m not saying the average student is more likely to misbehave, but they\u2019re most likely to be disinterested in the subject matter naturally. So you have to be constantly planning amazing activities that grab their attention (which often don\u2019t follow content standards) which is honestly exhausting. Planning a well rounded and fun activity takes days sometimes. As a professor behavioral management isn\u2019t at the forefront as the students are paying a lot of money to be there and behave because they\u2019re more embarrassed of acting like a fool in front of peers.\n\nYou also kind of act like a parent in a HS.

Your supervisor is there to guide but a big part of the PhD to explore and shape the work yourself. \n\nThe difference between MSc and PhD is that you must produce a significant and original contribution to knowledge (SOCK). Therefore, I see \"research in practice\" as exactly that. To be able to broadly understand a field (like at MSc) and also contribute in an original way (PhD &amp; researchers).\n\n&gt; 2) Typical week?\n\nMassively depends on you, your field, institution, the culture and the supervisor. I set up my own schedule; I worked around 5 hours of very intense work a day and 1-2 hours of less intense work (mon-fri) and that was enough to meet my goals. There was the odd weekend here or there, but no all-nighters or anything like that. You have read the horror stories as have I, but it wasn't that bad for me!\n\n&gt; 3) Industry?\n\nIn the UK most STEM PhDs are usually funded and may have an industry sponsor/partner. At that point it depends on the company, but at the very least they will attend meetings and want to shape the research a little bit. I found it a real help, especially in finding research questions; if they have a problem or issue you automatically get a novel research question. I am not sure how you would go about setting this up yourself, everyone I know who worked with industry had a formal sponsor in place before they were even selected.\n\n&gt; 4) Team vs solo?\n\nThe thesis will be your own, but will be shaped by supervisors. More collaboration is probably possible in your research group (other PhD students, researchers) but I just focused on my own thing.\n\n&gt; 5) \"publish or perish\"?\n\nOf course, as a researcher, it's your job to produce papers. I wouldn't say it's \"publish or perish\" exactly, but I would strongly suggest getting a journal article or two before you go the viva (the final exam) because it shows your work is original and contributed to the area.\n\n&gt; 6) Worth it?\n\nYes, loved it. Very hard but worth it.\n\n&gt; 7) Attributes?\n\nSomeone that isn't afraid to ask questions. Someone who is willing to make mistakes and learn. Good time management and willingness to work hard.\n\n&gt; 8) What kinds of jobs await you afterwards outside of academia? Are they worth the investment? (to clarify: not that someone should choose to pursue a PhD just for the job afterwards)\n\nI am staying in academia, at least for a while, so I'm probably not the best person to answer. You will definitely be earning a lot less than your peers while you do the PhD, probably near half as much, so it's something you need to think about. You *might* be able to catch them up with promotions after, but no guarantees.\n\nHopefully that has cleared up some of your questions.

I moved away after college to chase a passion of mine in the music industry. I was working along side the biggest names in the industry. I learned the native language in just a few months. I was getting paid next to nothing for my work while making the rich richer. I was going to bed hungry some nights. Searching for coconuts on trees just to drink and get nutrients.

I took mushrooms for some soul searching because I heard they were the future of pharmaceuticals. They were extremely helpful to my condition and I developed a love for psychology. I instantly took whatever money I had left for savings and dumped it into a masters program non matriculated, without knowing if I would ever even get accepted. I ended up getting 100% average in all my classes. I became the top 1% in all of Psychology. I got invited into a research lab. Did tremendous work systematically and was very reliable. I received 3 letters of recommendations from doctors. I took out a loan from my financial aid and applied to 23 schools. So now, here I am, pacing. Thinking about all the hate I  experienced.

Instead, they got caught multiple times doing what they shouldn't have and I was both a witness and a person whose research would be irrevocably harmed by his actions. Hence, I became an instant target. I wised up before it was too late, and learned a lot.\n\nFirst, before you do *anything* is extensively document everything you can. Every email or text message, every time he did something inappropriate, and every time he reserved shared accommodations. Make multiple copies and store them in safe places.\n\nSecond, I would look for your institution's Ombuds officer. They are confidential advisors who can help counsel you on what your options are and who to talk to. They can help you figure out what you want to do, and recommend resources and point you to the right administrators. They will likely give you much the same information as Randy did in this discussion (admins, student groups, Title IX) but also help you think about your advisor's psychology.\n\nI don't know this POS, but I can guess what he might try to do. He may try to pin it on *you.* When backed into a corner, he could lie send say that you were coming on to *him* and he was trying to separate himself from you to get away from you. When I discovered that my colleague was hiding something,  I had a short lead time. Once he started to clue in that I was suspicious I he threatened me while we were both at the same venue. I reported it as harassment, he escalated, and then it went quiet for a while. Then he started sending private threats, which I ignored, then public anonymous threats, and concocted a story about how I was harassing *him.* I had the receipts and I did not respond to his threats. So make sure you keep quiet around him and get what you need while thinking about what he might do.\n\nIf you are at a public university in the US, you may also get information via a public records request. This can be used to obtain his emails, receipts, and more. It may often be done anonymously, too. You'll want to think about getting in touch with other students who may corroborate your story.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry that he is hurting you like this.

I can't give you a generic model, but I can tell you how it happened for me:\n\n* My co-founder used his PhD project specifically to find a technology that could be translated. He did techno-economic assessment on a few different projects on which he worked to find the most viable, and pushed that one as far as it could go within the timeframe of his PhD\n\n* Our PI is very industry-friendly, and actually came out of industry to become an academic. He maintains an industry network that we've been able to leverage (though much less than I expected we would). **Many PIs are not interested in translating technology, so find a supervisor who is**\n\n* My co-founder personally had money to invest because he's rich (\ud83e\udd2e, but it's the way things are). Though this may not be a necessity, it certainly does help.\n\n* My university has several incubators through which we found most of our support, both in terms of $$, names to attach to the project, and customers (potential and real)\n\n* Incubators like Indie Bio are friendly to this kind of work. Be aware of IB specifically, though, as the deals they offer aren't great and they have a perspective that often puts the cart (customer and $ acquisition) before the horse (having an actual technology). We avoided them, but we've had friends who've found them useful, so YMMV\n\n* Because of connections made through incubators, we've been able to partner with larger research institutes to build out projects. These institutes/similar organizations are difficult to find and even more difficult to become friendly with, but once you're in the network you have quick access to everyone.\n\n* Government money for technology transfer is almost free-flowing. Apply for grants, find partners to apply for grants with, leverage money through tax credits and dedicated leverage programs. We have turned almost every dollar we've received into 2-5 dollars through leveraging programs.\n\nAbove all, you must have an idea, a technology backing that idea, and a mechanism by which that technology will turn $1 in into $2+ out.

I joined his group as an undergrad and stayed for PhD, so I was his first student. I think it was a learning experience for him as well as for myself so I guess he put in the effort to make sure that he was doing the best job. He was available for his students, he kept a pretty good eye on us, and most importantly he prioritized what's good for his students. For example, at one point I was considering transferring to a different university for personal reasons. After hearing what I said, instead of being mad or upset, he actually encouraged me to apply (but I didn't end up doing it because my plan changed). He also encouraged his students to get internships (which apparently is something rare), and he even found me my first internship. The best part was when he requested his students to stay late in the lab at night or come to the lab on weekends he would buy us lunch, donuts, or coffee. I know overall these might not sound like much to some people but as his student I really felt that he cared about us, and I was actually a little sad when I graduated.

I was in my 2nd year when I had the thought of leaving. The main reason was the toxic culture in the lab I was working in. There was no way I could have known about it, because my PI was new, and I was part of the first batch of graduate students. I realized her biasness and inclination for kitchen politics in my 2nd year, and contemplated leaving, but stuck it out anyway because of the harmful conditioning that students undergo before joining a Ph.D. program: that the program is \"supposed\" to be mentally and physically grueling (to a point that affects your mental well being), and leaving a program midway is a sign of failure.  I have read this in another post, and I completely agree to it: mental burnout is considered normal in Ph.D., and a lot of graduate students wear it as a badge of honor. I was ready to deal with the intellectual demands of the project I was working on, and never complained about the long hours I had to put in, but the underlying bureaucracy and politicking are what drained my energy. My PI was initially quite unhelpful and ignored me and my project for as long as possible, but she got interested when I had interesting findings and was ready to publish. I graduated about 2.5 years back, and the project I worked on is now probably the main focus of my PI and has generated multiple major publications. This is the same project she termed as \"low priority\" in multiple lab meetings, whereas right now, there is hardly anyone working on her so-called \"high priority\" projects. I published well too, and right now I am a Postdoc, but do regret the fact that I could have authored a lot more papers with the leads I generated, had my PI not been selfish, and supported my work (like she did for other grad students). While I like the fact that it made me an independent thinker, I feel depressed thinking about the lack of support I received from my PI and what I could have done if I got the guidance I deserved. I plan to switch careers (leaving academia) and right now, actively looking for industry jobs. I still love the benchwork of basic research, and the thrill of a new discovery, but don't have the appetite for the useless politics in academia anymore. My advice: stick out only if you think it is necessary, but weigh the cost-benefit ratios early on.

Talk to their grad students and do not join any group without talking to the grad students and asking them what they do Friday night to Sunday evening. If they're telling you that they work all weekend, don't have outside interests, and spend all their time in the lab, don't join them. You want a life, and in fact I think the most important thing you can do is set boundaries earlier. If your PI wants you to work over 60 hours a week, they're toxic and want you for free labor instead of your value. I wouldn't give hours of work to Starbucks for free, and I view grad school in the same way. I don't care how much anyone in the department begs, I will not work an hour over my contracted teaching hours during the semester. If they wanted more hours, they can pay me more for my time. Most academics have never worked a job outside of academia and because of that they don't realize that grad school is just a job and not some charity case where you need to put the problems of the school on your shoulders. I'm contracted to teach general chemistry, I'm not contracted to stay up all night emailing students, chase them down for work, or spend my entire weekends grading if it goes over the 20 hours Im alloted to work for them. If you set strong boundaries when you start, you won't get walked all over and treated as if you are lessee. Especially as a woman in STEM, faculty and staff will take advantage of your time and try to take as much as possible because they know you'll let down your boundary, but they won't bother you for extra tasks if they know you won't work uncompensated. It's not my problem admin refuses to pay faculty positions and would rather have underpaid grad students teach all undergrad courses, and I'll never make any of it my problem or stress to carry. \n\nYour PI will dictate the experience you have in grad school. Mine is awesome, and his work style is something I can work with. It's important to me to have a work life balance because I have a disability and can't afford to allow my health to dip to satisfy others. He doesn't care what time or the number of hours I spend on research as long as I'm productive and have work to show for it. You don't want to work for someone who sees you as a subordinate because you're a grad student, and you want to work for someone who values your work as a scientist. My advisor told me day one that nothing is a stupid idea and he's not there to be a publishing farm but actually help grow our skills as independent researchers. Most people do NOT know how to actually mentor students and too many see grad students as free labor. A lot of students in the organic division at my school are accepted because the college knows they needed grad student labor, and when they won't spend every waking moment in the lab they're mentally abused and make to feel inferior if they don't keep working until they get results. That's not real science and that's how you end up leaving a program when you could've completed it. \n\nI spent many years in therapy and I encourage you to go as well. I wouldn't have developed the interpersonal skills and coping mechanisms on my own, and starting grad school with a stable mental health is so important.\n\nFinally, it's important to have a life outside of science. I'm not just a chemist, and I want to be more than just a scientist in my life. I still love chemistry because it isn't my only interest. I work on two different topics, one in Chem and one in physics because when one project isn't working, I can jump onto something else and come back to the problem more refreshed and to look at it with different eyes. Both topics are computational work which is why it works, but having something that adds to your professional toolkit that other candidates will not have wxposure to do. Grad school is the time to be a sponge, talk to as many outside people as possible, and use the time to LEARN. You will get so much more out of a program if you don't make it your entire identity and make sure you take care of YOU first. My girlfriend is the most important person in my life and she certainly helps me stay away from those more toxic habits grad students slip into. We've been together since undergrad and I seriously couldn't do it without her in my life because I can just bitch to her and she just gets it and helps me get out work mode. My education is certainly important, but our relationship is something I'd dare to say is just as important to develop with her, and I want to be a good partner and also be a good grad student. I also try to have some friends outside of the program who are just living life as adults and not students anymore.\n\n\nAnalytical Chemistry/Physics", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sjjuqk/can_someone_say_something_positive_about_their/hvg76s2/"}, "730": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "historianbookworm", "Date": 1643911570, "Score": 6, "Body": "If I have to be honest, it didn't work at all for me.

My classmates have published in nature, nature biotechnology (IF of 55), Science, Science translational medicine, science immunology, JAMA, nature medicine, and I'm sure there are other ones that I can't recall off the top of my head and 2) the student's success is also the success of the PIs because it goes into their files for their tenure reviews and general opinion of their faculty peers. While thess students had multiple papers, I found that they took longer to graduate, likely due to staying to finish the papers or the PI being unsure of how to graduate a student or holding the student back because the lab depended on them.\n\nHow you described the senior PI is 100% correct. How else do you expect the PI to have time to be so well know, to collaborate so much, to have that many papers or citations. Most of these labs have a system in place where the senior people train the new people, and rarely if ever do you get one on one time with the PIs become the PIs' times are very valuable. I was trained that way and my meetings with my PI were 5-10 minutes long, once every two weeks or once a month because she was always out of the office. She never showed me how to analyze or run any assays. It was always to the point conversations on the big picture while the postdocs were my real mentors. I preferred it that way and also got a handful of papers out due to being in a resource rich environment, which includes money, knowledgeable people, physical support from a ton of research assistants, established collaborations, AMAZING LAB MANAGER, money, money, MONEY. Never once was I held back from doing research or going to conferences due to money. Because she had a bunch of other people to work for her and because I have already finished my four papers requirement set by her from the start, she let me graduate at four years and probably forced my committees to let me leave too because she was a senior to everyone. But more importantly, I just don't like to be micromanage, which she did not do. I could take as much vacation as I wanted to because whether I succeeded or failed did not affect her amazing career. It only affected my graduation timeline, as said to me by her. Overall, the clear goal to graduate, my lab manager's amazing ability to organize/order/maintain the lab, and endless lab money were my reasons for picking the lab\n\nI had no problem transitioning into industry but am doing an industry postdoc because my technical skills are limited due to having very focused PhD projects. But my soft skills - project management, critical thinking, running multiple projects at once, writing, presentation, troubleshooting etc -are great because of the independence force onto me by an absent PI and busy senior mentors.

I have gravitated towards groups like this over the course of my career for a number of reasons.\n\n1. They have an established network in academia that will help you in the next phase of your career and beyond. This includes getting your papers published through top journals, getting grants with this professor, and also getting grants/jobs after. When I apply for grants, the reviewers always comment on my track record of having trained with leaders in the field, I attribute a lot of my success to that alone.\n\n2. They tend to give you more independence in constructing your own theories / research aims. This is huge. Young professors usually have a more narrow research focus early on and it can be tough to look like you are adding any of your own intellectual ideas to the work, especially if they are telling you exactly how to proceed with the research. The further you go in your career the more important it is to have less project overlap with your colleagues, as you're trying to carve your own space/niche out and convince people you're the only one who can do this work.\n\n3. Young Professors micromanage. If you are early in your career and lack a lot of project management skills, this can be advantageous. Generally speaking though, if you are going to succeed in academia, you will need to learn to do research independently and I think it is good to challenge yourself and learn these skill sets early on.\n\n4. Morale is usually higher when working under established professors in my experience. This is really important as your attitude and perspective can influence your PhD experience tremendously. It just helps to be on the winning team and not fighting for space/resources at your institution.\n\n5. Established professors usually have more funding.\n\n6. You want to learn from the best so I feel it makes sense to train under people who have not only succeeded at becoming a professor, but also succeeded at being a professor. Not all junior faculty are going to \"make it\" in the field, and few of them are going to rise to the point of distinction.

Working with postdocs and senior PhD students might not be a bad thing because they likely are the ones that are doing all the work in the lab and probably know their research and the lab better than the professor. The downside is they might be too busy with their own research and might not have the time and energy to spend on you.

Speaking from my own experience, my PI was very motivated so we were able to get a lot of things done. He also kept a close eye on us and was very available for us. He had weekly group meetings and even one-to-one meeting with us. One additional perk is that AP's chance of landing a tenureship is somewhat dependent on the number of PhD students they produce so there might be a chance that you could graduate a little earlier than your cohorts (Of course that's contingent on how much you get done). The downsides though include long working hours, funding uncertainties, and you might have to spend time building/developing lab/equipment/methods that might not directly contribute to your graduation.

I do think not doing so does create a disconnect between things that are going on and things that are reported to you, especially given that it is *your* lab.\n\nIt's not to say that these meetings need to be a super formal \"Here's the lesson for today.\" It's more of a \"shoot the shit with your boss\" in some cases, help talk about ideas or concepts, and set up action items and goal posts for your students and employees in general. It's something I've seen regularly away from academia in professional roles, and to be honest (especially in a virtual world) it has been very effective.\n\nIn my own previous experience, I spoke with my PI pretty regularly (5-10 minutes a day, usually while getting coffee in the morning) so that he was aware of what was going on in his lab. I think at first he was really uncomfortable with it because, yes, personnel management isn't usually something that you're taught. But it became such a habit that if I didn't do this, he would eventually look for me to chitchat and discuss things. It helped really develop ideas and get on the same page on projects and where things were to go.\n\nHis subsequent students and postdocs haven't taken this approach, and I think my old PI attributes this to \"everyone works differently.\" But the output is pretty stark (e.g., fewer publications since I've been gone, breakdowns in communication that were clear while I was still there, confusing resentment based on a lack of communication). He had a graduate student that was clearly struggling, and not having a weekly meeting with him (only talking during lab meetings) really exacerbated issues until the student dropped out entirely. I have professor friends also that are struggling with their students, largely because of expectations of things that they believe a student should know even though they're new in research or publishing, and they also don't do weekly individual meetings (if they do a regular meeting, it's spread much further out).\n\nHaving a weekly meeting doesn't mean putting members' opinions a colleagues in high regard.

As a faculty member I have students fail out, probably due to an issue they are unwilling to share. \n\n-While having an inside view of a disorder can be a great help in research and clinical work, it can also be a liability. It will color how you see the research and clients and objectivity will be harder to achieve. Ive seen this in students who start their research believing the truth IS x because they are fully invested in that explanation for personal reasons. Properly they should start believing x is a hypothesis to be disproven like every other hypothesis.\n\n-risk of disclosure includes stigma, even among mental health professionals who should know better.   However, they should recognize that having persons with a variety of backgrounds gives clientele greater choice in finding a therapist who matches them. We all have challenges and strengths and the goal of a graduate program should be to help you recognize how your particular combination of traits can be managed to help others most effectively. \n\nYour ethical obligation is to know what clientele you should not work with because you are either too emotionally invested or are insufficiently invested. Your clinical supervisor can do a better job of helping you through that process if they understand your strengths and weaknesses. They will likely suspect you are on the spectrum, the signs are distinct. Self honesty is an important part of being a clinician but it is a journey. Observe your clinical supervisors and decide who to trust with this information. If the answer is no one then get your own therapist through the counseling center so you get help on the journey. No one can do this alone.\n\nLet me leave you with 2 role models. First is Marsha Linehan who created Dialectical Behavior Therapy based on her own experiences as a person with Borderline PD. She came of age in a different time and I believe did not reveal her situation until she was functioning as a professional. \n\n2nd is Elyn Saks, author of The Center Cannot Hold. She is an exceptionally intelligent person who developed schizophrenia. Her journey disrupted her education at repeated intervals and couldnt be hidden. It took time to realize it wasnt going away.

That's not to say there are bad programs out there that are a complete sham, but the PhD does provide valuable training and growth.\n\nI do think that the biggest issue is that most students go into the PhD with an unrealistic idea of what the PhD actually *entails*. The PhD isn't a jobs or professional program like getting an MD, PharmD, or JD. You're not on set paths leading to a number of jobs you *should* take at the end. And you're given a lot of responsibility in terms of choosing your own career path, albeit all in very different ways and circumstances. If you're looking for something more regimented, more likely than not you should be applying to Masters programs.\n\nIn the same token, you're left so much *on your own* that it's difficult for new students to manage. The burnout I think people face has a lot to do with setting self-expectations too highly without giving yourself a break. And things like progress and mapping are often left to the student, whom sometimes may be too stubborn or afraid to ask for help when needed, or may not be able to find adequate help. Mentors should ideally help navigate this (e.g., it'd be nice if a mentor actually told their employees to *go on vacation* or force them to take off for a bit), but often they do the opposite which is just stupidly unhealthy. \n\nPersonally speaking, I think fewer people should be in PhD programs, and more should be encouraged to go through the Masters route, which is what I think most people expect.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/smobby/what_a_great_email_to_wake_up_to/hvxxrr7/"}, "1472": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Diddly_eyed_Dipshite", "Date": 1644240796, "Score": 25, "Body": "Hey, I've looked over your post and comment history, I hope you're okay and that you find the help you need.

I should say my opinion is not shared by all; some people think he's a terrible PI and blame him for them failing the program.\n\nIn the beginning I struggled a lot; he basically will never tell you to do anything. I have seen a student in our lab just totally flounder, do nothing for 4 years and no one said anything to her. Don't underestimate when people say \"are you a self-starter?\", really consider if you could read papers, generate a PhD-worthy project/hypothesis, and learn all the skills required to do it/apply them. In my lab we're really given no guidance, I have hit walls where I spend 6 months and hours per day simply trying to generate a hypothesis. In my experience this is a little bit *above* normal graduate work, more similar to post-doc.\n\nNow, on the flip side, if you *are* a self-starter then in a lab like this you can do literally anything you want. Since joining I've spent over like $100k on genome-wide crispr screens, whole-genome sequencing a bunch of stuff, can order any reagent I want under \\~$1000 and if it doesn't work no one cares.

Frankly, early PhD students don't yet know enough to spot holes in the current literature, identify what new work would be interesting to your community, scope the topic so that it's large enough for a dissertation but small enough that you can actually finish, know what constitutes a sufficient contribution... The goal of the PhD is to teach you these things.  \nYou should talk to your advisor, tell them everything in this post. Is it expected that you come up with a research topic \\_entirely\\_ on your own? Your advisor might already have some potential project ideas that you can expand on. Also, if you have browsed one topic for 4 months and can't find anything, it's possible that there just isn't anything to do given your constraints. Mention this to your advisor too, and specifically mention the questions you considered but don't think will work. It's possible that they can help you modify one of these into something that \\_will\\_ work.  \nThis isn't the only way to do a dissertation, but another technique is to find out what is currently interesting to your research community and see if you can carve out a niche there. You can do this yourself by looking at the most recent papers in the conferences you're interested in and see if there are any commonalities between the papers there. Any of your research professors should be able to tell you this for their field, so you can also ask. Literally just something like \"I'm interested in \\[\\[broader research area\\]\\]. Where do you see this field going in 5 years?\"   \nUltimately my biggest suggestion is to tighten the feedback loop between you and your advisor. I find that it helps me to always have some sort of actionable, achievable plan that is scoped to a period of time. If something comes up to force a change of plans, you enter an iterative process where you quickly (&lt; a week) come up with ideas and get feedback on them from your advisor. \u200bThat way you don't get stuck in situations where you have been working hard but somewhat aimlessly for months.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sn90gc/help_need_advice_even_if_it_is_blunt_or_maybe_i/hw4rdrf/"}, "1766": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "maddumpies", "Date": 1644355532, "Score": 13, "Body": "This feels less PhD advice and more friendship advice.

I actually made my presentation for the defense along with the thesis (not aesthetics, just a high level of bullet points/slide of what material I wanted to touch upon). I first did the intro on the presentation as how I want to present the topic, motivation behind choosing it, current state of affairs, etc. Writing this out helped me form a logical train of thoughts (as I would verbally explain  to an audience). I then roughly followed this structure to write out the corresponding sections of my thesis (with minor tweaks as needed). Once you have a structure set, it's less daunting to fill out each individual sections.

All TAs have the same negotiated contract. ~22k/year for TAing 20 hours for 3 quarters (so 9 months). Includes (very good!) health/dental insurance and student fees minus ~$500 in local fees. You\u2019re also guaranteed graduate housing (you have to pay, but it\u2019s cheaper than anything else in the area) for the duration of your normative time to degree. Graduate housing ranges in price from ~$450 to ~$1,300 on the most expensive end of things, with most paying probably $700-900 a month. \n\nWhat\u2019s good: grad housing is pretty nice for the price and you don\u2019t have to worry about moving at all during your PhD, the health insurance rocks compared to other student health insurance plans across the country, the 9 month appointment means you can choose employment over the summer. We\u2019re also negotiating our new contract with UC right now, which should include a big pay raise for us, but there will probably have to be a strike before any real movement happens.\n\nWhat\u2019s bad: Irvine is expensive as hell. Forget living off campus. If you have medical bills, a pet/children/dependents, or any other needs, surviving on the base stipend alone isn\u2019t going to happen. Many students make it work, but as a student with chronic health conditions and resulting medical bills, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to attend on the base stipend alone because I pay the same amount I pay in rent on medical bills every month. \n\nMost departments have departmental funding of various kinds that they offer to incoming students to lure them in, e.g. $5k one time stipend top-ups. The Grad Division also has some top-ups of ~$20,000 that they offer to ~5% of incoming PhD students (again, a recruitment tool). Things like this make it possible for many students to come. It\u2019s also common in STEM fields for people to be RAs, which (until we negotiate our contract with our new union) comes with varying salaries (sometimes higher than TAing, sometimes lower). It\u2019s possible that will be part of your funding package. If CS is anything like my department, you might be able to squeeze out some no strings attached summer funding by negotiating, which is also quite helpful. `\n\nTL;DR: Irvine is, IMO, a great place to be.

Over time, the field will shape into a collection of very useful and insightful findings that have solid evidence to back them. The bad stuff will get wedded out as well.

I found a lot of these funny to reminisce on as I am close to finishing. I also saw some that astounded me -- like who gives first years some of those pieces of advice? LOL.\n\nObviously though the biggest thing is that it's going to vary by field.\n\n1. Don't focus at research is correct. At least in the social sciences where I'm at, in the U.S., unless you come from a wildly more prepared background than the average first year PhD student, your research in year 1, should you even be trying to get it published, will be shit enough that you will be embarrased by it later; instead, yeah focus on learning how to be a good student and, yes, the rest will come.\n2. LOL this one hit me hard. But in all seriousness you can't read everything at the level of depth to have extensive critiques of every article/book. PhD year 1 is learning how to synthesize and critique scholarship quickly; if you aren't doing it as fast or as well as others, it just means they had a leg up in terms of being ready to dive into the process. But that doesn't mean they are inherently more likely to be a successful scholar. We've ALL known that genius kid in coursework who never finishes the PhD. Don't sweat this.\n3. In my field you have to try to get less than a B. I'm sorry if you're in a field where coursework is designed to weed people out. Where I'm at it's designed to be tough but not to fuck you over if you put in the work.\n4. I'm finishing my PhD and didn't have a clear idea of what exactly I wanted to research after year 2. I had general ideas but not a specific focus. Varies by field but 100% I would say don't sweat this one.\n5. 100% agree talk to your advisor, again, unless you're in a toxic field or department, EVERYONE in my program who had a good relationship with their advisor had really great outcomes when they were open and honest about challenges, struggles, etc. This idea that you're \"not cut out for PhD\" is stupid and toxic and I'm sorry if it's how your program works but I hear about it on reddit wayyyy more often than I see it IRL.\n6. Research is stupid, let's just all take a moment and admit that methodology and research ethics is SUPER important when they teach it to you but the second you're out in the cutthroat world of TT jobs and publish or perish work, the profs and researchers love to pretend like they wake up every morning and shit out T1 journal submissions with zero problems in the research. The process is messy as fuck under the hood, people just learn to fake it til they make it.\n7. IDK what to tell you about this one. Faculty determine who they let in to the PhD program based on the stated interests fitting what they do. If your interests diverge between when you entered and when you're ready to commit to a project and the dept. doesn't accommodate you, transfer. Transferring happens a LOT more than people realize.\n\nAnyway.Maybe my whole ass response is a woosh bc the topic DID have a /s, but seriously reply if anything is stressing you out (OP or anyone).

They literally just want to talk to you and get an idea of who you are as a person. I literally talked about windows with one of the professors and we were laughing!!\n\n\u2022 Know your research!

Details below v \n\nMy current supervisor (who has admittedly known me since undergrad years, although we became more familiar around my final when I was applying to do masters in his lab) is really supportive about my anxiety problems, general shitty state of family etc. When my anxiety is on overdrive and I can barely speak to him without a stutter to tell him I need some time off, he barely misses a beat and tells me to take a few days off. No judgement, little pressure, our working relationship does not change when I come back in my normal, functioning working state. He understands that PhD is challenging, research can be hellish, we openly discuss imposter syndrome and mental health in society/academia as a conversation topic while in the lab sometimes.\n\nIn a previous lab, it was recognized that mental health issues is a 'thing', but it was never discussed openly if at all, the topic was almost taboo even amongst the students, and the general lab environment was a 'you have to work a bare minimum from 9-to-5' plus the typical extra hours of weekend or working til late. The pressure was exerted by the lab culture, but not strictly enforced, so I could get away with going home at 11am because I was unwell and had already messed up a DNA extraction thrice in a row at the same mistake (me packing my bags and leaving still earned wide eyed looks). \n\nIn a previous-previous lab, I was worked to the bone by a professor, worked more hours than SHE did to get data SHE wanted, maintained some semblance of sanity \\*somehow\\* for a full year while juggling a full university workload (I was in my 2nd year of undergrad), and I had to fight with her to be able to go home for the holidays (International student, in undergrad years I typically go home once a year, and going home for me is also horrible because family issues but still).\n\nI begged her to let me leave pretty much in tears/nervous breakdown because I was so severely burnt out and depressed. She let me go, but then she went to the school counsellor without my permission or letting me know, where she told them that I was 'unstable', and then she spoke to my \\*current\\* supervisor about me and told him how she doesn't understand why I'm 'like that' because she thinks her childhood was 'more traumatic' than mine therefore I shouldn't be like that. Current supervisor, at that time wasn't even that familiar with my family issues/mental health problems, but he shot her argument down. (Jokes on her, she tried to recruit me behind my supervisor's back to work on a project for her because she cannot get any students to join her lab, I forwarded my supervisor EVERYTHING. Also, really, why does she want someone 'unstable' in her lab anyway lol).\n\nSo it's really a lottery when it comes to academia + mental health really.

First off, I hope you can find your way out of what makes you feel that way.\n\nFor the homesick part, I can relate that a lot. Although not quite the same experience, I had similar troubles during my freshman year. I got accepted to my dream university, in the biggest city of the country, but the campus was in the middle of nowhere at the same time (you had to spend your first year there for language school), way too away from everything. So only thing you could do was to go to your classes and socialize in the cafeteria or the bar (literally nowhere else to go). I was quite shy, didn't make hardly any friends, and almost everyday I cried, thought about going back to my hometown, resit the university entrance exam and start studying at a university in my hometown. I did not even have a laptop or anything, (this was also before the smartphone era) and I felt quite lonely. Luckily i met a guy and we started to date (he turned out to be an a**hole later on, lol). And suddenly I had a reason to stay there. Homesickness immediately disappeared, and I survived. So my advice would be to find a reason to stay there, it could be making friends, membership at a gym or whatever. I know that these are not easy in your condition. But one little change could change everything. Of course this is the thing if you choose to give it another chance and decide to stay there.\n\nFor career part, first, immediately forget about others' expectations of you careerwise. You don't need to be successful for other people. \u0130t is your decision and yours alone. Your worth is not based on it. Even though they do not pressure you formally, don't even let them your let yourself think that they can guilt you into anything like that. By the way, being mid twenties when you finish your degree is not at all a problem. I know it might seem scary from where you are now but for me, age doesn't work like that. Speaking as a 31 year old in the first year of her PhD. Your life energy -whatever the hell it is- determines what you can or cannot do. About the lack of experience, it of course depends on the country, the field or other things but, even people with a lot of real life job experience struggle with that, do not go hard on yourself with that, but maybe read some sources or watch some videos about it. Also I think getting a job is at least 50% is networking. (Again, this depends on the context). Maybe you can talk to someone who knows about your qualifications and they can recommend you to some position etc. Also, i guess you are comparing apples and oranges here. Please don't compare yourself with your friends who got into good positions as soon as they graduated. There might be millions of reasons why this was or wasn't the best route for you. \n\nIf I were you, I would try to change the little things in my life that I actually have control (which possibly you think you don't) and give it another chance, since you say that you like what you are working on etc. Try to break down your problems and slowly work on them, see if you can at least reduce the negative effect of them on different parts of your life.\n\nBut of course, these will require time and effort. If you think you cannot deal with these, there is nothing wrong with quiting.\n\nHope you can figure it out.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sqvl6v/quarter_life_crisis_long_ass_post/hwo6qgy/"}, "2655": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1644688559, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

You will read papers that aren't related, papers that aren't related but are interesting and have interesting questions, papers that will help you build up your publications, and papers that will actually help your progress. There is no \"wrong paper\" or \"wrong knowledge\" or \"waste of time with reading\". \nAbstracts usually have two methods: one is when the publications is already done (it's rare) and the other is when you know the topic but nothing about how your publication will end in the summary.\nFor the first it is really easy the second is harder but every abstract has it's \"bullet points\". \nFirst you introduce the topic itself and write one or two sentences about it. Then you write 1-2 sentences why your topic is important. Then you show the methodology (what method you used etc.) then you write down what are the results (first method) or what results do you see (without the actual data). If you write the latter here, in the paper you can point back here in your summary and write that \"our previous thoughts / hypothesis was good / wrong about this, as data showssomething like this. \nAlso communicate with your leader because no one knows your topic better than him / her.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/srgdr2/starting_it_right/hwrzudx/"}, "2791": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "eddypat-med1990", "Date": 1644762426, "Score": 6, "Body": "Much too familiar", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/srjdq9/we_did_not_say_a_word/hws3h8g/"}, "2792": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SanctimonyBasher", "Date": 1644762538, "Score": 75, "Body": "Self care is important.

In Aus and for some programs, during fourth year (Honours) a thesis is required and involves supervisors who usually also happen to supervise PhD students. If there is some access point like that where you can develop a research relationship with supervisors in the university/college where you wish to do the PhD, and you do well in the remaining years of undergrad, it will help with surmounting the GPA issue. In Aus, we often already need backing from potential supervisors as part of/before applying for the PhD. My field is psychology.\n\nI\u2019m one year in to my 3 year PhD and have ADHD.

Have a planner and put all your work in it. Reading schedule. Assignments. Meetings (with zoom links if virtual). And tasks like \u201cput readings notes into zotero.\u201d More on zotero later. \n\n2. If you struggle with mass amounts of reading, look up reading strategies and tools. Find something that works for you because professors aren\u2019t necessarily super compassionate in terms of decreasing their reading load. \n\n3. Your courses are basically \u201cintroductions\u201d to the ideas and topics. The class will not cover everything which means you are not expected nor should you feel like an expert at the end of the course. You should have a good foundation and you should have a direction of where you\u2019d like to explore further. Again, you will probably not master the content by the end. \n\n4. Know why you\u2019re reading what you\u2019re reading. If it\u2019s just for a class discussion, skim for main ideas and talking points. If it\u2019s essential to your dissertation, read more deeply. \n\n5. Expect that the most important texts for you, you will likely read again someday for a paper / dissertation. Help future you with an annotation system that works well. I like to highlight good quotes. Then when I read again later, I\u2019m like \u201coh, that\u2019s a juicy quote\u201d or I\u2019m like \u201cthat\u2019s lame.\u201d But the important thing is that it\u2019s allowing me to have a \u201cconversation\u201d with myself about the content. \n\n6. Have a file management system. I put all my class readings in a folder specific to that class. Then if I think it\u2019s important, I pull it into my \u201cresearch archive\u201d folder where I have literally all the readings I\u2019ve done outside of class in addition to good readings from classes. My field uses APA, so I label all my articles as \u201cauthor last name (year published) title\u201d \n\n7. Start using a citation manager day 1. I use zotero which is free. I input all my readings into there so when I need to cite something, it pumps out a citation in proper format. I also use zotero to tag and sort my readings based on themes and ideas. So if I need to reference \u201cimmigration,\u201d I can literally just look at that tag and find everything I\u2019ve read which I associate with immigration. I also put my notes into zotero as well, so all my quotes and ideas are in one spot like a giant notebook \n\n8. When in doubt, make a mind map / concept map. This advice has been unironically recommended to me by older grad students, young professors, and well seasoned professors. Remember that academia and research isn\u2019t just about knowing facts. It\u2019s about understanding the connections and being able to synthesize across several similar or dissimilar ideas. \n\n9. Outline every paper you write. A step in your writing process can be \u201cword vomit\u201d on the page to just put words to ideas. But do not word vomit the night before a paper is due in hopes that your word vomit makes sense. It might. But you\u2019re leading a lot up to chance. \n\n10. Try to join a writing group. Even if you don\u2019t have big writing projects, being exposed to more academic writing while it\u2019s in the drafting stages is great for your learning. \n\nOkay, there\u2019s probably more I could say, but I\u2019ll leave it at that for now lol.

Based on the fact that you started your doctoral program last October, you obviously (**1**) survived a year into your doctoral program, (**2**) your first year of coursework, and (**3**) your respective first-year course professors all deemed your work good enough to give you a passing grade. Thus, I see no reason to question the quality of your work.\n2. I can tell you right now, there is never any good that comes from comparing yourself or your work to that of others, including your classmates or other students at various different points in your program. **Firstly,** at the doctoral level, you're expected to get an \"A\" grade. As long as your pass the course and your professor considers your work good enough to pass their course, who cares whether someone's writing ability, research ability, or vast knowledge in a respective subject is better than yours? **Secondly**, in a lot of instances, unless you ask or get to know them, you don't know people's educational or work-related background. I have a friend of mine in the same doctoral program as me, but came to the program 2-years after me (2 cohorts after me). Even though I was working on my dissertation (and was done with coursework) when she started her first year (first semester) of coursework, her writing and knowledge of teaching was vastly superior to mine (like not even in the same galaxy). This was because she had taught abroad for 20-years and she had published close to 50 or so articles before coming into the program. I'm not sure about your doctoral program, but even in my own cohort, the age range is anywhere from 25-46, with me right in the middle at 34. While we are all at the same or similar stages within a doctoral program, each respective cohort/classmate brings different levels of teaching experience, knowledge, and expertise into the classroom. This also means that they may be at a different part of their journey in life in regards to research paper writing or teaching compared to you, which is perfectly fine and nothing to be ashamed of. **Thirdly**, as someone who is getting his Ph.D in English Composition and Applied Linguistics, I tell all my Freshman students that writing is a skill that you never master and are constantly improving upon all throughout your life. It's no different at the doctoral level and frankly, is something that is a life-long venture. **Fourthly**, The reason why I implore you to stop comparing yourself to others is because of the potential person you could become. At my university, they send out monthly theses/dissertation E-mails for our department that states who will be defending and on what day/time. When you first enter the program, you never know any of those people because they're in cohorts so far above yours. But as time and the years go on, you start to realize that you do actually know some of the people defending because they are either from the cohorts 1-year before you, are in the same cohort, or are in the cohorts after yours. That happened to me and as someone who really struggled with getting my dissertation started and wasted basically 3.5 years of my eligibility being in a funk, I started to become a really cynical and jealous person. By comparing the speed of my progress and at what stage of the dissertation I was to that of others in my cohort, I started to get jealous and hateful toward my classmates due to their success, **which really scared me**. These were people who I loved, supported me, were intelligent and awesome classmates, and had worked their ass off (and made countless sacrifices) to defend and pass their dissertation defenses. I had to have one of those self-talk, self-reflection moments in my life and say \"no more.\" I had to tell myself that I had nobody to blame but myself for being in the predicament that I was in, that I needed to stop comparing myself to others, and finally, get my head out of my ass and start working. After this, I wrote my 3-chapters in 5-6 months (and successfully defended) and accomplished something I hadn't been able to do in 3.5 years. It's all about having a positive mindset and having a structured plan/schedule.\n3. One thing that one of my professors said to me (and my classmates) on the first day of class (during my first semester of my first year in my doctoral program) that I believe to be absolutely \"**true**\" is that getting your doctorate degree is very much a group effort as it is an individual one. You're all striving toward the same goal so why cause division by pitting yourself or competing against other classmates or people in the same program? In regards to strictly coursework and coursework quality, there really is no benefit at all to comparing one's quality of work or writing ability to others, or competing against other classmates. Quite honestly, from my experience, the classmate(s) who were like this were the ones who would unintentionally alienate themselves from classmates and other cohort members because people found that type of behavior childish, cancerous, and they usually only wanted to only use you to further their own single minded agenda (homework help, personal editor, pass off workload to others). For me, I want to see every one of my cohort members graduate and be successful professors/educators. I've attended every dissertation defense of my cohort mates who've gotten to that point and vice versa, I know they'll be there for mine when that day comes. I've even prepped several of my cohort mates for first or final interviews for teaching jobs because they need the support. Likewise, when I was struggling with mental health and similar to you, second guessing my ability to finish out this doctoral dissertation work, it was my classmates picking me up. My advice for you if you have not done so is really invest in your classmates/cohort mates. Spend time outside of class hanging out, getting lunch/dinner, studying together, or even going out for random hangouts. Building authentic, genuine relationships is always great, but your classmates can be a great support system, especially when coursework is done and you no longer have that forced interaction. This is something that many doctorate programs never tell you about or prepare you for. All of a sudden, you're alone in your room for hours/days on end just writing your dissertation or teaching most of the week/semester and you don't really see many of your cohort mates/homies. This can be a really depressing time of your life as you have this herculean task in front of you that you know will take several years to complete before you can go onto the next chapter of your life (future job). Thus, investing and developing those relationships with your cohort mates is so invaluable because they can be the people you need in your life when you need someone to vent to, socialize with, or just have someone who you know knows what you are going through. I always say, my parents/friends are an awesome support group and while there verbal statements of support mean a lot (Ex. keep working hard, you got this, try your best), they fall on deaf ears sometimes because they have no idea what writing a dissertation or doing doctoral level work is like. They can't talk from personal experience. It's actually my classmates word's of encouragement that mean a little more in this instance because again, they're working on the same thing (coursework, dissertation chapter), they've been in my shoes, they can relate to similar stress/frustration, and they can talk from personal experience. Moral of the story, don't compare yourself to others and instead, build tighter relationships with classmates/cohort mates :D\n4. Lastly, if you're that worried about your quality of writing/work, if your university/institution has one, use the writing center. That is, of course, if the quality of writing is what you are truly worried or self-conscious about. I thought I was a good writer when I entered my program and on the first major assignment for one of my classes, my paper was literally bleeding (marked up in red) and I got one of the lowest scores in the class. It was suggested by my professor for that course and ironically, the writing center director, to use the services of the writing center. It was one of the best suggestion and decisions I ever made. I used it all year and the difference in my writing ability was a night and day difference. I loved the help I received so much that I decided to apply for a job there the next year and I've been working at my uni's writing center for 5.5 years now. I actually looked at one of my first semester, first year final papers a few months ago just for shits and giggles and the quality of writing was disgusting (in a funny, English nerd sort of way). You'd be surprised how much the quality of your writing and work improves from the beginning to near the end of your doctoral program journey. Don't be too harsh on your own work, just make the conscious effort to actually constantly improve and know this change is not going to come over night or in a single semester (but over several years).\n\nGood luck OP, you got this!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/stjb2w/first_year_woes/hx4fsu7/"}, "3242": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "emp_raf_III", "Date": 1644979479, "Score": 12, "Body": "The small silver lining is the knowledge that in 90 years, the tragedy of your graduate studies will be made into a major motion picture.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/statbp/the_story_of_my_phd/hx4fuzx/"}, "3243": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "No_Income6576", "Date": 1644980183, "Score": 2, "Body": "Perfect response.

And also the experience of PhD is very different from area to area, and from country to country. So, not knowing your reality, I can't give you a specific advice, I can just offer my experience as an example to (hopefully) motivate you. What I can tell you is that I learned enough to do what I needed to complete the thesis. And the cost of learning new things was that it took me a little longer to graduate than usual. Until 2000 I was studing AI, data mining and machine learning. In 2001 I learned about genome sequencing, just enough so I could build the machine learning models to analyse the genome sequences. I didn't learn the wet part of genome sequencing, but I can understand a paper about it. I was suposed to write a dissertation in 2 years, it took me 3 years because I accepted to work in bioinformatics (the program granted me an extension because they were interested in the bioinformatics project). After that, they offered me to study the immune system, as I already knew bioinformatics, but after I accepted I found out it was a completly different area, had to learn new things again. So, I visited labs with mice, saw how they do the experiments, and I can interpret the results. I can't do the experiments in mice, and I don't know how to extract the fluids and how to put in the immunoblots, but I can read papers about covid and stuff like that. So I learned enough to be able to write a thesis. 2 years after the thesis, I began working as a full time professor in another area completely different, because of my background in data mining. So here I am 12 years now in a completely different area, studing all sorts of new stuff. So, have you heard of T-shaped professional?

I started working full-time after I completed all my coursework and was ABD. It was very challenging to find time to work on my dissertation. I was drained after working 8+ hour days + taking care of my life, and finding time/inspiration/energy to write and analyze data. I think if I stayed as a full time student, I could have finished my dissertation in a year, but it ended up taking me 2.5. I have a colleague who did the same thing, and they ultimately withdrew from the program ABD after four years of trying to balance things. There are obviously many factors (especially your mental health) that will promote or discourage your progress. So, is it possible? Yes. But I would say that for me, it was more challenging than I anticipated, especially as time wore on, and if I had the choice, I would NEVER have done it. \n\nNow, since you are asking for advice, my advice is write everyday. Get your routine down where there is dedicated time in your schedule each day to not only write, but do all the other things that are school-related. Don't let your work create distance between yourself and your program. Make sure to meet with your advisor regularly (maybe weekly if possible), Stay engaged as much as possible with your program. The more attention you shift away from your program, the more distant it will become. Grad students are honestly a dime a dozen, and I am willing to bet that if you disengage from your program, you can expect the same from your advisor in due time - even if they are supportive and you have a good relationship. Set deadlines and goals for yourself, and schedule your proposal hearing (or equivalent) with your committee to keep you on track.

I worked in the industry for around 10 years but three years ago, I decided to quit my job to pursue a PhD. I also have a family with two children. I want to comment because the conflict you are having is similar to the ones I had many years ago. \n\nIf your parents are like mine, their definition of \"happiness\" may be different from yours. I don't doubt their sincerity when they wish me happiness, but their unique life experiences helped define their definition of happiness and that can't be the same as mine. \n\nNow, while we have differences that arise from having different life experiences, there are also differences that arise from just being alive for a longer period of time. Now that I'm in my late thirties, I can see the points where I was wrong and also points that my parents got wrong. Nobody's perfect and there is no \"right\" answer.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest two things. One is to be open-minded. It's easy to take an all-or-nothing stance on these issues, but it's  more difficult to find a good balance. For example, you could buy a house, have children, but not have a 6 figure salary. Or, you can do your post-doc, and have children, but buy a house a bit later. Talk to your parents about which things you can't compromise and which ones you can accommodate. \n\nSecondly, and more importantly, show them (not tell them) that you are happy. They may wholeheartedly want to encourage your career path. However, as parents, it's not easy to encourage that path if there is even a sliver of possibility that it may lead to unhappiness and regret. Your parents are not afraid of your being happy, they are deathly afraid of your choice leading you to unhappiness. \n\nI see this, now that I'm a father. When my first-born insists that I share my spicy chicken sandwich, despite there being a slim possibility that he may enjoy spicy food, I discourage it because I know how spicy it is. He eventually tried it, and he was screaming and crying for a good 5 minutes. On the other hand, my second child actually loves spicy food, and I would never have found out if he never tried it. So, do what you think is right, but show them (not tell them) that you are happy.

Then, for all 30, I setup an input flag file (which theory level to use, how accurate to make it, what to actually do, etc), k point sampling file (don't worry about it), and a potential file (describes the shape potentials of the core of the atoms in the simulation).  Then, I \"relaxed\" the geometry of each to its local energy minimum. Then, I did more calculations by editing the input flag which determines the number of electrons in the calculation in order to vary the charge of the defect and relaxed their geometries with the new charge. We're at about 150 total calculations now. Then I wrote a script to package all of the important results I wanted. Now, over in python, I'm writing a script that imports the resulting energies. I will compute the formation energy of each of the defects within the band gap of the material to look for deep trap energy states. Then I'm going to build surface simulations with the defects associated with the deep traps (hopefully there's only 5 or so) and do band structure calculations to actually identify the trap state in the energy band.

This depends on the PI. Even more so than in other countries, in Germany you depend entirely on your PI.

Today a PhD would be like an entry-level or early associate-level job in a given career path. You got to the associate level in your career path and decided it wasn't a good fit for you. So **now you've made a mid-life career change**.  There are *so* many people who do that, many of them after 10-15 years in a given field. So you're actually at an advantage compared to those people because a) you only spent 4 years in your original career before making a change and b) you have a credential and extremely valuable skills that will make learning this new job easier/faster than if you just had a bachelor's degree.\n\nYou feel like you're starting from scratch because this career is unfamiliar and unrelated to your degree, but I guarantee that every day you are bringing skills that you gained at your PhD to your new job, even if they are not super obvious. PhD programs teach project management (designing and running a course or managing experiments in a lab), critical thinking skills, research skills (obviously, but you would be surprised by how many people in the everyday world are very bad at basic library/database research), attention to detail, writing, etc. Your new job hired you in part for those skills. My friend who works in tech said that he specifically seeks out employees who have advanced degrees (even if those degrees have nothing to do with what his company does) precisely because those skills tend to make them better project managers than the people with certificates in project management.\n\nSo you should be pretty proud of yourself! Regrets are normal - academic culture has conditioned us to believe that we shouldn't settle for anything but a TT job (preferably at an elite institution), but most academic jobs are high-stress, poorly paid, have poor work-life balance, and require you to move to whichever place you can get a job, even if your partner lives and works somewhere else.   But guess what? In most fields, employees who are presented with these types of conditions will eventually look for a different job (and that's considered to be the sensible move professionally).

You can't work during an Oxford DPhil (beyond a few hours of tutorials, which are poorly paid). The university will not allow it, the college will not allow it, your supervisor and your department will not allow it. So you will not be able to earn any significant amount of money for 3-4 years. You will only have what money you can bring with you **right now**, which I'm guessing is close to nothing.\n\n2. Being self-funded perverts your motivations. Where everyone else will be pushing to get extensions from their funders and take 4+ years, you will be rushing to get done in the minimum time possible and for the least money. That means a worse thesis, with less networking, fewer conferences attended, and less research done. Your future career prospects would be worse. \n\nFunding being competitive is what makes Oxford competitive. If you didn't get a department scholarship and you can't get any university wide funding, then you know you're pretty low down on their priority list.

Putting my life on hold for several years was worth it to achieve that goal. You may have different hopes and dreams, and so you'll make a different choice.\n\nTo answer your question:\n\n**Best:** A lot of intellectual freedom and comraderie. Anything I wanted to try my advisor was fine with, and I could dig as deep into fundamentals as I wanted. I also spent a lot of time with the other PhDs in the department. We'd be at the lab for 12 hours a day, but we'd regularly take coffee breaks or extended lunches, and were always willing to help each other out.\n\n**Worst:** Putting your life on hold. For 5ish years, I barely made enough money to survive, when an MS would have been earning $60k+ from the beginning, and getting regular raises. My postdoc paid me that much, and I can't describe the sense of relief at being able to put money away for the first time in my life.

The fact that you have healthy savings will make it much easier. \n\nRegarding worries around starting a family - I totally get it, but unless you\u2019re literally on track to start trying for a baby in the next couple of years (I.e, properly settled with a partner and you\u2019ve been talking/thinking about babies or are very close to that stage), there\u2019s no guarantee that would happen in the same timeframe anyway, PhD or not.

What subject is your PhD? What degree did you come out of or were you working? And what was the name of the class you\u2019re worried about? \n\nKnowing that, this sub can put your experience in context. I had a bioinformatics programming class that I was *positive* I failed the first test on. I got the 2nd highest grade. It can be hard to tell sometimes. \n\nWait until you get your grades back and compare them to your peers before you freak out.\n\nNow to your real question. Yes, people drop out for failing classes. Most grad programs require you maintain a C average and not get lower than C- in any class. If you don\u2019t know, confirm that with your adviser. \n\nThing is, if it\u2019s just one class, they\u2019ll probably let you retake it. \n\nIf for whatever reason your grade is abnormally low, you might need to rethink your study habits. Grad school is much different from undergrad. Cramming is not and option. You\u2019ll need to study sustainably, an hour or two every couple of days for a couple of weeks leading up to the test, then use the time you\u2019d usually cram for to reinforce the content. That works *much* better. If you\u2019re not using a day planner with a calendar to see what tests and assignments are coming up, get one immediately. Next, the fact that you had no clue how to answer the test content despite studying would suggest you studied the wrong thing. Sometimes that can be the professor. Read the syllabus to make sure you had the content right, and if you aren\u2019t sure **go to office hours**. Professors give away a huge amount of the test content during office hours. Also, study groups help. \n\nFinally, keep an eye on your mental health. Halfway into semester 1 is too early to get burnt out. Are you keeping a regular sleep schedule? It is important. You aren\u2019t 19 anymore. Even if you have to cut sleep, trying to keep the hours as consistent as possible will help. Now, all things being even, if your mental health gets worse despite all your habits being perfect, *then* consider if grad school is for you. It isn\u2019t for everyone, but don\u2019t let one bad test or the adjustment period color your whole experience yet.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sv07pz/failed_a_class/hxdwlmu/"}, "3839": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "chingalingdingdongpo", "Date": 1645147902, "Score": 2, "Body": "Well, it was a neuroscience class.

I mean, I appreciate the rigor, but if it's just exams, at least I can just study for that in my own time and pass them, right?\n\nNot necessarily. What you are suggesting is something that in Europe or in Asia may work in certain disciplines, but I know that in the US (and in certain cases in Europe as well) you may be required to attend class in presence. Due to the pandemic, these last two years have been relatively more relaxed, but in the next future it will probably come back to that. Please note that this is for a Master's degree, since in Europe is usually impossible to get a PhD without a master's degree first (maybe it is slightly different in the UK, but I know first-hand that most people get a master first there, too).\n\n&gt;It probably wouldn't horrifically interfere with my ability to keep working.\n\nEh, yes and no. I got my master's degree in Europe while working full time, but I was lucky enough that my job was extremely flexible, since I am a freelancer, and even then it was a challenge. But maybe you would have less difficulties, every person is different. At the same time, I am going to stop working in the Fall, since I am starting a PhD in the US and my VISA will specifically prohibit me to work (outside of jobs assigned by the university I'll be enrolled in).\n\n&gt;I would assume that if I'm doing competent research, then most of the necessary skills and knowledge would be practically acquired on some level.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, a 16 years old should be allowed to get a PhD before graduating. The point is that a university usually won't consider your research to be competent and academically valid if you didn't have proper training in academia. Additionally, consider that this admission cycle had been one of the most brutal to date (and it's probably only going to get worse in the future). You are asking a university to pay you (or at least waive their enrollment fees) without having the required credentials. PhD students are usually horribly underpaid, but between fee waivers and stipends, US universities easily pay a PhD student between 150,000 and 200,000 dollars for the whole PhD process. With so few spots and so many applicants, what you want to do is probably not gonna fly with them. Also, depending on the field, universities usually invest in people who are more likely to stay in academia.\n\nWhat you're suggesting is not necessarily impossible, just extremely unlikely.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/svh80r/can_you_get_a_phd_in_linguistics_without_a/hxhtupz/"}, "3997": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bs-scientist", "Date": 1645217958, "Score": 8, "Body": "That's not normal at all. \n\nThere are times where I have to work insane hours.

Not saying the hard work is useless - usually, you learn a lot - but you are not always rewarded materially with a publication or a grade for the hard work you put in. This can be especially hard when you see other Ph.D. students doing \"better\" than you in terms of their projects. So, although it's a hard pill to swallow, it's important to remember that you and your worth are not defined by your results/accomplishments and keep working diligently despite this.

It's a tough situation all round: for you, your Master's thesis advisor, and the even your department chairs. This is just my input on your situation:\n\n1. **Your health (mental, physical, psychological, emotional) is the most important thing here**. Before worrying about any aspect related to your graduate program, I'm sure I can speak for most people that your overall health should be at the forefront of importance. This includes: (**1**) making sure your in a good enough mental/psychological state to continue on with your Master's Thesis studies, and (**2**) making sure the types of drugs you are taking (as well as the dosage) is taken care of for your carpal tunnel syndrome/anything else health related. I think it's also important to ask your self and self-reflect on whether you have the adequate support systems in place to be able to finish out a graduate program. This includes your therapy dog, family/friends back home, classmates, professors/mentors, etc. This includes people who you 100% can rely on when you are in a dark place and just need someone to vent to, be able to relate to what you are going through, listen to you, support you, and give you reassurance (Ex. graduate school work stress/pressure, Master's thesis struggle, loneliness, depression, etc.). I'm glad to read that you surrounded yourself with more positive-minded people. I would also look at your institution and see what other resources are available to you (Ex. Counseling center). I said this before in another thread in this sub-reddit, but your classmates (professors as well) are some of the best support systems because they know what you are going through at least in regards to the struggles related to the academic side of things and can talk from experience. Your friends/family back home may mean well when they offer words of encouragement (try hard, do your best, we believe in you, etc.), but they can't talk from experience of going through a doctoral program or doing graduate level work.\n2. **Look at this situation from your Master's Thesis advisor's point of view**. I understand that you may have some pent up frustration and anger toward your Master's Thesis advisor, as well as feel like he/she has betrayed you. The piece of advice I would offer to you is examine your situation from your graduate advisor's point of view. **Firstly**, as you stated, you have a relatively young and perhaps experienced master's thesis advisor who we can imagine hasn't had as many graduate advisees to mentor as some of the older, more grizzled veterans in your department. Furthermore, he/she has most likely never had a advisee with serious mental/psychological health issues like yourself and thus, this is absolutely new/foreign experience for him/her. I'd imagine, he/she has had to consult his/her department chair and other faculty members to determine what course to take with you in regards to offering you the support you need, as well as following the legalities of the university/law (so he/she/the university don't get sued). **Secondly**, this next point I think I can talk from personal experience. I suffered with mental health, as well as just made excuses for my lack of dissertation progress and due to this, I wasted 3.5 years of my doctoral eligibility (this was on top of the 2-years of required coursework). I had an amazing professor as my initial doctoral advisor who I had taken several courses with, respected immensely, worked well with, and I felt was a match made in heaven in terms of dissertation advisee/advisor relationship. However, I missed 6-7 dissertation chapter 2 deadlines in a row. My advisor pleaded with me on several occasions to tell her what was wrong, what she could do to help, and what system needed to be in place for me to feel supported and make progress. She did everything she could, **I just fucked up royally**. I ultimately got dropped by her as an advisee because if I could only speculate, but (**1**) she could not trust me anymore, (**2**) I betrayed her trust, (**3**) my word no longer held any weight, and (**4**) I was wasting her valuable time. **In regards to your situation**, I can only speculate, but looking at it from your Master's Thesis advisor's point of view, things have unfolded to where you are having a meeting with your thesis advisor on Monday because: (**1**) Your advisor questions whether your overall health will permit you to finish out the program and submit a successful Master's thesis, (**2**) your advisor questions whether your overall health will permit you to make progress on your Master's thesis and meet pre-determined deadlines (for thesis chapters) before your Master's program eligibility runs out, (**3**) he/she does not want his/her valuable time wasted by missed deadlines (whether health related or not), (**4**) your missed appointments (while only a few to be fair) puts your word and reliability into question, and (**5**) your advisor no longer has any faith in you as a advisee and wants any reason to pass you off to someone else. The last point hurts, but it definitely is a possibility. We have to remember, it's a privilege to have a professor in our department agree to take a student on as an advisee, not a right. Yes, I understand it's in their job description to take on advisees every year who move onto their thesis writing stage, but again, it's also a privilege that professor's see enough potential in us as students/academics and in our topic to take us on as advisees. In saying that, when we betray their trust or in your case, whether fair or not, they begin to question our ability to see out the Master's thesis process, I think they are perfectly within their right to let us go. **Thirdly**, I think your advisor is going through all the legal processes and step-by-step stages to make sure he does not discriminate against you (due to your health issues), put himself, the department, or the university in harms way legally, and to prove (if need be) that he offered you all the support he/she could. Hence, the weekly meetings, E-mail correspondence, extensions, and meeting scheduled for Monday. He/she wants to have a paper trail and proof that the support offered was \"by the book\" and kept professional. **Fourthly**, I think he/she may worry about specialized treatment to where you are being given treatment that many of your other classmates and other students in the same program are not allotted. Again, this is just me speculating, but when you wrote \"he emailed me asking me when I would return to lab and that it is not ok that I am not in as it reflects badly on him...graduate students have to be in, the pandemic is the new normal now\u201d etc.\" This strikes me as someone who does not like handing out accommodations/extensions and expects everyone to pull their own weight, regardless of their situation (health issues included). I may be speculating, but that's the vibe I get. It's one of those people who believe that one has to put in the same level of blood, sweat, and tears that hundreds, if not thousands of other graduates from your program years prior have put in to receive their Master's degree. No exceptions are allowed/accepted, including ones related to one's mental/psychological/physical health.\n3. **My advice to you for your meeting with your thesis advisor on Monday**. **Firstly**, you better look yourself in the mirror, be honest with yourself, and determine whether you can truly see out this Master's thesis or not. Nobody wants their time and money wasted, including yourself and your thesis advisor's. **Secondly**, as a way to instill a little confidence into your thesis advisor and reassure them that you will see out this Master's thesis, I would offer them a detailed explanation of the support networks you have in place. This includes perhaps telling him/her (while some of this may not be legal): (**1**) medications your on, (**2**) counseling/therapy help your going to, and (**3**) healthy life decisions you've made (Ex. removed negative people from your life, talking more to classmates, etc.). **Thirdly**, I would create and bring a very detailed PowerPoint or Word document that highlights the deadlines you expect to uphold for each major chapter or section of your Master's thesis. Additionally, explain some of the rationale for why you set each respective deadline and what you plan to do to make sure you meet each deadline (Ex. time manage, study in a quiet place, determine number of hours worked for each day of the week, etc.). This really shows that you've put thought into the steps you need to take to finish out this Master's thesis. **Fourthly**, I think this actually would be worth doing but, also tell your thesis advisor what you expect and need of them to be successful. In my case, I needed a dissertation advisor that would hold me accountable, have monthly Zoom or in-person meeting check-ins, and allowed me to set chapter deadlines that worked for me. I knew I had a tendency to procrastinate and took more time than my peers to finish a chapter so hence why I doubled the time frame for turning in a chapter. If most of my classmate's needed a month to finish chapter 1, I asked for 2 months. This is because I know myself better than anybody else in the way I learn, the \"usual\" time frame to finish a chapter doesn't mean anything to me, and lastly, as long as I meet a deadline and fulfill a promise to my advisor, who cares if I need double the time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/swnglk/need_advice_for_meeting_with_pi/hxnnjf9/"}, "4268": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "GonzagaFragrance206", "Date": 1645324843, "Score": 1, "Body": "**Fifthly**, be confident. Your advisor may very well be using your mental health against you as a reason for questioning your commitment, ability, or as a reason to drop you as an advisee. In my personal opinion, that's a pretty shitty thing to do and it is worth asking whether you truly want a person like this as your master's thesis advisor. However, if you still want this professor as your advisor, be confident in how you talk during this meeting. I think the confidence you exude in your body language and tone will really hit home what you say to your advisor within that meeting. While you should never have to apologize for your own mental health, for the sake of keeping in the good graces of your advisor, I would: (1) apologize for the missed deadlines/presentation, (2) reassure him/her of your commitment to finishing out the master's program, (3) explain why your advisor is absolutely vital to your master's thesis committee and can't be replaced by someone else, (4) share your detailed master's thesis schedule plan, and (5) put him/her at ease that you have the support systems in place to finish out your Master's thesis.

The job itself is super boring and repetitive and I use 0% of the knowledge or skills I have, but at least it helps me pay the bills for now.

I'm still going to the gym, socialising, and doing my best to keep a healthy life. \nThat is good enough and, in this sense, is enhancing my work, helping me grow, rather than distracting or deceiving me. \nIt's also great in therapeutic terms and introspection, something that is difficult to get otherwise. It's also helping with thinking an reflecting on writing, my psychological approach and way of working, devoid of my personal self-deprecation and imposter syndrome caused self-defeatisms. \nI don't know about the effect of marijuana enough as I'm not an use (and it triggers anxiety for me) but if it brings you beenefits, just keep going. \nSome things that's good to keep in mind with the literature, is about discover the values that drive them. Besides the idea of trying to find something wrong with drugs (Vs finding benefits) to questioning what is cognitive perfomance and how they operationalise it. \nIn this latter case, if it is true it does affect cognitive performance, you need to ask yourself \"how bad is it\"? Meaning, is the cognitive performance one needs to operate a forklift but that enhances your creativity? Or is it working memory? Evaluate the trade offs and be rational/calculated in taking risks or moving forward (that goes with drugs as with any lifestyle choice). \n\nAll the best!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/swqvnw/marijuana_and_performance/hxor9ek/"}, "4400": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bitch-et-al", "Date": 1645351778, "Score": 3, "Body": "My situation might be a bit different because I have a prescription for medical cannabis.

Very rarely will you get funds to differentiate between once a week smokers and four times a week smokers. There's often simply not enough variation between those populations to warrant devoting a large amount of funds and studying. Statistically, it might be hard to differentiate, but often times, too, we're studying clinical level impairments, and one to four times a week often doesn't rise to that level. \n\nRegarding strains, sativa versus indica is kind of a misleading, false dichotomy, as I understand it. I've never smoked before, but my brother has smoked probably every day of his life and grows marijuana professionally. At some point long ago we might have been able to better differentiate sativa from Indica strains, but cross breeding has led to a continuous spectrum where nearly everything you could consume is some degree of a hybrid. It's been a while since I was doing that research so I don't know if the FDA changed things, but where you could source the marijuana for the studies was often very limited and frankly out of date, so who knows what strains are even available.\n\nI remember we once requested permission to run a pot brownie study in order to test the time course of cannabinoid metabolites, with the purpose of starting to build information so that law enforcement could better determine whether or not somebody was currently driving under the influence. We originally stated that we would distill the marijuana down to oil and bake that into the brownies, as everyone does. However the FDA responded very strongly that we were not allowed to do that because it would be too potent, and that we had to bake the marijuana directly into the brownies, which just wouldn't work. They also wanted us to use extremely low-level potency marijuana, because they didn't seem to understand the composition that regular marijuana users were using.

For me, the only questions I had where I didn't really \"know\" the answer, was when we were discussing my lit review and each examiner asked about whether I had considered or read any literature relating to X, and whether that had informed my approach or what impact I thought X might have on my area, with \"X\" largely relating to their field of practice. And rather than saying I don't know, it was more a case of \"that's a really interesting concept/approach that I hadn't considered but would be interested to learn more about!\". Or in my case \"my field is very interdisciplinary and it wasn't possible to include every single different approach to the subject as I had to draw the line somewhere, but it's an interesting lens that future would could consider the subject area through\". I got minor corrections, and one of them was to include a small section in my lit review covering something one of my examiners suggested. \n\nOn the day, you'll know a lot more than you think you do now. The night before my viva I spent hours annotating the pdf of my thesis with justifications for everything I thought they might question me on, thinking I'd need to read it off of the screen as I wouldn't remember, but I didn't look at my notes once. Generally a viva is about 2-3 hours which sounds like a lot, but remember you've put 3+ years into this. 2-3 hours isn't a very long time to cover 3+ years work, so I found alot of my questions were more surface level, general discussions than having to justify every tiny decision or bit of analysis that I did.\n\nHope this has helped, happy to answer any further questions you might have!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sx091f/deleted_by_user/hxprv32/"}, "4483": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "isaac00000", "Date": 1645372921, "Score": 8, "Body": "Just to complement this, chances are low, but you must know the team or the IP that you are applying to, if you go to a cold calling it will be much more difficult.

I'm glad to see a growing consensus that is a yes but with exceptions. I have ADHD and chronic migraines so even a 9-5 can be torture if my symptoms aren't manageable. But I push through. Many times I feel like I'm not doing enough. And compared to someone who doesn't deal with that, I'm not doing enough to get done on time. But I'm working towards it. I'm figuring out how my body works. Hopefully this helps some folks with similar struggles.  Some key things are\n\n\n1) sleep! I have to have 8 hours. I can burn the midnight oil on something that needs the work but I'm dead the next day so it usually has to be the last of the work. Otherwise I just work all night to lose a day of work.\n\n\n2) eat. It's easy to forget to eat but I absolutely have to on time. Again, this is about keeping my brain going and the pain minimized. Skipping meals triggers my migraines big time and can be crippling. The one two punch of ADHD and migraines means I can get locked in and not realize I'm starving until it's too late.\n\n\n3) breaks breaks breaks. I absolutely have to minimize screen time which is an insane thing to deal with because that's 75% at least of the PhD. But PC work triggers my migraines so I have to listen to my body and take a break from the PC when it tells me. I can get away with 30 minutes on 20 minutes off but that's hard for me to manage because with my ADHD I really need time to get my head focused on what I'm doing and then when I get focused I'm locked in and it's hard to pull out. So now I take breaks and try to shift to something else constructive for 15-20 minutes like chores, exercise, even a part of my meal prep. But anyway I take lots of breaks.\n\n\n4) Be resolute! Make decisions. It can be easy to procrastinate and do absolutely nothing because you are avoiding the most important thing which is usually dissertation work. Well, decide to not do it! If you're just going to fuck around and stay in the \"about to start\" holding pattern all day maybe you need to decide to just put it off and move on. This actually helps me get motivated. Because I can actually use my energy on something else. Even if it's just watching TV or playing games. Obviously you have to still do the thing at some point. But actually doing SOMETHING breaks that cycle where you just feel guilty and avoid doing anything. It's even helped put me in a state where I can do the important thing. I laughed when my therapist said then just decide to watch Netflix all day. Decide to do something. But it's been the one thing that has really helped. Sometimes I'll get the guilt show up but I'll be like no I made this decision. I'm not gonna feel bad about taking a long break.\n\nAnyway.

You can also ask them about their first-year experience with this PI. Allow yourself some grace and know that everyone has different learning times. 6 months maybe enough for some to become independent, some may need a year. Another thing, you don't have to be passionate about the research. Honestly, this research is temporary and you are only doing it for your PI. You don't have to do it forever. That being said, if you ABSOLUTELY HATE the work, don't even find it remotely interesting, then maybe this isn't the best lab for you. You don't have to quit the program, but will your department allow you to switch to a different advisor? In my opinion, talk to the postgraduate tutor first. See if a switch is even possible and are there other projects available that have a  vacancy. No point discussing if with your advisor first and then the tutor being like there are no projects we can switch you too.\n2. 2 and 3.  Working remotely IS TOUGH. After the university resumed in-person activities, for many months I was the only one in the office and everyone else was working from home. I understand that it can get incredibly lonely when all the chairs next to you are empty. My advice in this case will be to have a routine. Having a routine will also help you feel a little more motivated to work. Plan for working hours, say 9 to 5, and then have plans ready for what you want to do after 5 pm. Exercise, meet friends, go to a cafe or read books. Maybe joining a class will help you find friends? A yoga class or pottery class or whatever else you might enjoy.\n\nWhile stricter working hours keep you on track, wfh does offer a lot of flexibility. It is a double-edged sword, but try to leverage the good side of it. Given you are struggling to catch up on the skills, hard deadlines might make it a lot more stressful experience for you.\n\nI'm not sure how dropping out impacts your chances of PhD in the future, but that would be a great question for the career office personnel at your university. Talk to them about this, ask if they can connect you to someone who actually did drop out and then applied to another PhD program again.\n\nI hope at least some of this is helpful for you. Good luck with your decision. Remember, you are so much more than your work and PhD, so whatever you decide, you've got this!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/swzndu/need_advice_on_quitting_phd/hxskhhn/"}, "4620": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BrooklynVariety", "Date": 1645417571, "Score": 1, "Body": "I love my research and have gotten good opportunities from my advisor.

You could certainly take more time to make a more informed decision. Read up on the literature in your field voraciously - these are the end products of years of grinding and pain, and ask yourself if you would feel fulfilled if such papers are your identity and are what defines your career. Talk to as many academics (who are candid) as you can, and understand what makes them love or hate their jobs. Also talk to industry practitioners who have PhDs - they would be able to advise on the tradeoffs of academia vs industry from actual experience.\n\nWith that said, my go to advice for prospective PhD students in business schools who also have tasted what industry life is like, is always that the PhD is **not** worth it unless you are convinced that you love the research process of an academic lifestyle, and you also need to love it enough to get you through the pain of publishing and academic politics.

If you have an inclination towards one of them, you can convey that without being too direct I guess. They should be able to pick up that up from your interaction.

Was meant to hurt me and nothing more. He was *expecting* the International office to call him. He didn't even argue with them.\n\nThankfully I had someone there with me in the first meeting so I didn't seem crazy to the international office....\n\n\nAnd that took such a big toll on me. It also forced me to stay in a very expensive country without a contract for a month, with very little money from my poorer country.

Sounds silly but when I meet someone new that I\u2019ll see again, I make it a point to memorize their name. When I run into them a second time, I say \u201cOh, it\u2019s (name), right?\u201d People are generally pleased if you remember their name. If you\u2019ve asked about their research in the past, try to ask a specific follow up to show you were listening. \u201cYou work on (topic), right? How is it going designing/building/running\u2026\u201d \n* Share food. Seriously. People love food! You don\u2019t have to cook it or have it be fancy. If you have lab meetings, ask if you can bring something for it. Muffins, donuts, the boxes of coffee from a local place - you can spend less than $10 and get a little positive feeling from your lab mates. If you are a good baker this is even better!\n* Offer to help people from time to time. Grab the door for them. If you\u2019re washing glassware, ask if they need anything washed (don\u2019t make this a regular thing lol). It\u2019s easiest if it\u2019s something you\u2019re already doing and adding one more won\u2019t take you much more time.\n* Ask people about themselves and share a little about yourself. You don\u2019t want to overshare with an acquaintance and make them feel awkward. People like talking about their pets and children (if they have them). If you realize they had a hobby, ask them about that. Be prepared to actually listen, though. \n* Pay them a work-appropriate polite compliment. Meaning don\u2019t compliment their weight unless *you know for sure* they are trying to lose weight and have said it to you! and avoid compliments about their body. Reserve that for a close friend. \u201cYou did a nice job on that presentation.\u201d or if they\u2019re into fashion, compliment part of their outfit. Shoes &amp; bags are usually \u201csafe\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice color on you\u201d also goes over well. Don\u2019t compliment them on something you don\u2019t really think, it will be obvious.\n* Identify the most sympathetic person in the group and start there. They can be a way in and vouch for you. \n* Keep complaining and negativity to a minimum. You\u2019re allowed to have a bad day of course, but someone who never has anything positive to say is not fun to be around, and the goal is to make friends here! \n\nLastly don\u2019t try a blitzkrieg of effort all at once.

Hopefully they're helpful.\n\nFirst-- you are not weak. Nothing about a PhD is easy and there's nothing wrong with struggling with it. Almost everyone I know who is doing or has done a PhD has had thoughts of being overwhelmed, incapable, and wanting to quit. It's normal. And that's not even considering how disruptive covid is to a PhD. You're doing grad school in hard mode. It's ok to feel overwhelmed.\n\nYour PI sounds like kind of an ass. Part of teaching and mentoring is helping students get themselves through challenging situations. Humiliating you in front of your whole group is not the way to do that. Since your PI sounds like he sucks, and you're not interested in the project you're doing now, have you considered changing groups? I know it seems a bit late for that, but I know a few people who did that and were very successful. The first few years of your PhD is really about developing general skills anyway, imo. Since you'd be starting a new project anyway, maybe time to consider making a clean break from your advisor.\n\nFinally, if you do decide to stick it out, I really don't think this is accurate:\n\n&gt;I will neither be a PhD level expert in the field I'm in because I haven't actually done research in that field, instead I've just written a software tool.\n\nIt sounds like a reasonable project to me. Sure, you will likely need to learn some new skills in a future job, but everybody has to do that. Maybe it's different in your field, but I can think of a few (important!) PhD theses in my field that were based around creating useful software.\n\nI can't speak to whether pivoting to a CS PhD would be useful. I'd make sure to talk to plenty of people in that field before making that decision. But before leaving your program completely, just consider the option of changing research groups. It's ok if you decide you still do want to leave, but you should know that it's an option.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sy3fgb/cant_tell_if_im_just_weak_or_if_this_phd_is/hxvw9u5/"}, "4836": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TotallyBio", "Date": 1645480626, "Score": 3, "Body": "Hi OP, congrats on finishing your PhD.

However, I would expect there is not always a perfect mapping, so that while someone like you (or me) would not be hired for an astrophysics-related position, you might very well be eligible for a neurobiologist position because you have a life science background.\n\nTBH the journals are a black box and I don't really have any more insight than you :) First, my advice is to look at current employees at the journal you're interested in and see if their training backgrounds correspond to their roles.

I am worried if that is enough for   \npublishing several high-quality papers so that I could continue pursuing  \n an academic path after finishing the Ph.D.\n\nCan only speak for Arts and Humanities so this might not apply to your subject area, but US PhDs are substantially longer because you are required to take classes in your first two years: their doctoral programmes have a substantial taught element that UK ones lack. In the US, you'd only get round to starting your dissertation in the third year, I think, whereas in the UK you dive right in. Also keep in mind that generally US PhD funding packages depend on you doing a certain amount of teaching yourself throughout your programme, and that in your final dissertation write-up year you generally have to support yourself by applying for various external fellowships and funding sources. In the UK, your PhD funding packages (whether that be through a regional consortium of the UK Research Institute or a University-based studentship) have no stipulation that you do a certain amount of teaching, so in theory you can focus more on your own research and publishing. Those factors leave ample time I think for getting published during your studies, even though the UK PhDs are on paper of a shorter duration.   \n\n\nI am sorry that I am not in a position to answer your second question, but I am sure someone else can.

Academic work can be very socially isolating, especially if you have workaholic cohort-mates. It seems like you're pretty happy academically, which is great - and honestly it indicates to me that you'll adapt and feel much happier once you find your people. This might take time, especially given the covid restrictions and your busy schedule. I found that I was happiest socially when I began trying to socialize outside of my department and even outside of grad school. You may find that taking a rec center class, joining a meetup for a hobby you like, or even volunteering for a couple of hours a week will help you meet people. At this point, I'm very content socially, but it took me a year or so before I started to feel comfortable with my social life in my new town. I have a hunch that your department's sense of community will change as things get back to normal. I know that my department still feels weird and deserted compared to how it was before the lockdown. I feel for more recent cohorts because they haven't gotten a true sense of what things are like on a normal day here.  As things open up and people adapt to normalcy again, the atmosphere will likely feel less cold and lonely.\n\nOn therapy: if it's not working for you after 5 months, it's time to think about the reasons why. Are you finding it hard to talk to/click with your therapist? Is the therapist's approach too hands-on or not hands-on-enough?  Is the therapist's advice just not working? There are so many different approaches to therapy and so many types of people working in that profession. Sometimes the first therapist is not the right therapist. I would urge you to shop around if that's something your insurance permits. If  you still find it's not helping a lot after you've tried several people, it may not be the right solution for you. But like making friends, sometimes it takes a while before you start to feel the effects of therapy working. It also requires an active commitment from you to implement the things you learn in sessions in your everyday life. I find that journaling sometimes really helps me reflect on my negative feelings and thoughts and just be more mindful in general.\n\nAgain, if you are truly happy with your academic program and your advisor, you're positioned really well to be successful, especially since you seem to have a strong sense of self and a good grasp on work-life balance.  Your academic journey is about you and your professional goals, not the goals of everyone else. If the grad students in your program are blah, you don't have to make them the center of your social life.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sz0v8h/deleted_by_user/hy13l7w/"}, "5070": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "man-im-trying-here", "Date": 1645572271, "Score": 1, "Body": "please i need more detail into whatever this is", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sybibs/deleted_by_user/hy13sdd/"}, "5071": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nubvn", "Date": 1645572351, "Score": 9, "Body": "Hi, fellow PhD!

And that makes it awesome.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/szlg5t/the_feeling_of_not_being_special/hy4hr5c/"}, "5259": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Sn0w_whi7e", "Date": 1645637745, "Score": 2, "Body": "Ups: going for my guest research stay in two days \n\nDown: i really want to quit this, and i wake up with anxiety and dread on my way to work everyday", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sx1uvc/weekly_ups_and_downs_support_thread/hy4hydi/"}, "5260": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bs-scientist", "Date": 1645638417, "Score": 1, "Body": "I think you're suffering from some imposter syndrome. \n\nIt's easy to see what you struggle with and can be difficult to notice that others struggle with other things. \n\nI study crop science, my research generally revolves around cotton fiber quality. \n\nI constantly feel like the department idiot. Most people here are miles better than me at plant physiology, agronomy, etc etc etc etc etc. I feel like the stupid kid in many of my classes. \n\nAnd then January comes back around and everyone is coming to my office because their PI made them get fiber quality data done on their cotton and they have no idea what they are looking at. But it came easy to me. The fiber quality class is \"that\" class in the department that people avoid at all costs because it's difficult and the professor who teaches it has high expectations. I made a 100, and the others in the class would come to my office asking questions because they didn't know why they got such a low exam grade. \n\nMy best friend is always wandering down the hall to me asking about fiber quality and statistics. I'm always wandering down the hall to her asking her about agronomy or soil, she really excels at knowing both. She struggles writing scientifically and comes to me. I struggle making a table or figure that isn't atrocious to look at and I go to her. \n\nLike you said yourself, you're great at analyzing texts, but not so great at translating them. I'd bet money that at least one of your friends who seems like a translating wizard really struggles with analyzing them. \n\nPart of why a PhD takes so long is because it's SUPPOSED to point out your flaws. So you know what they are and you can exercise yourself in those areas. Some people are really good at pretending they aren't struggling. \n\nBack when I was an undergrad, I worked as a research assistant. There was a PhD student in the lab who I really thought was the smartest man on earth. He never said much. He'd sit at his desk almost motionless all day, never taking a break. During lab meetings he always seemed the most prepared and like he knew what he was talking about. Another PhD student, who I also thought was incredible, told me all the time how much he wished he was as smart as the other. I finish my bachelors, graduate, and leave to do my masters elsewhere. I see the first PhD student I mentioned at a conference. We go out for some drinks, he will actually talk if a little buzzed. Come to find out, he had mediocre grades and the second student I mentioned in fact was the smarter one (on paper anyway, I keep up with both and both are incredible). The difference is that the first one was quiet, he'd struggle by himself in silence. The second one struggled out lout. He would openly say he didn't understand something, he would walk around the building until he found someone who could help him.\n\nMoral of the story, don't give up on yourself. Study those languages you need to study. Learn them. Lean on your collogues for help and let them lean on you in return. We are ALL struggling with something, we are all here to learn. If you were actually a bad student, you probably wouldn't notice or wouldn't be so worried about the things you don't understand. The worst students I've encountered are the ones that \\*think\\* they know everything.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/szd33e/how_to_tell_the_difference_between_imposter/hy4jqak/"}, "5261": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Faust_TSFL", "Date": 1645638644, "Score": 9, "Body": "I think this is partially a result of the absolutely bonkers job market - that if we want to actually get paid for this long term, we're forced into thinking we have to the BEST not just very good", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/szlg5t/the_feeling_of_not_being_special/hy4kceh/"}, "5262": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "Eulermeup", "Date": 1645640156, "Score": 7, "Body": "Because I\u2019m an idiot!

I'm not even the most senior grad student in a new lab (prof has been here five years) and I find myself doing a lot of work to help get us \"set up\". In addition we aren't even a \"lab\" per se: we are a theory research group. Not that theory is easy but any time you do experiments equipment alone is setup overhead.\n\nYou have a complicated situation, but a very common one: first generation students, particularly international, are rarely supported sufficiently to succeed to their fullest potential. Many grad students will feel burn out because learning how to say no is a skill very few are trained in. For you because there's always a stress of failing to meet a cultural norms it may get compounded. The best resource for this is to talk honestly with your supervisor that you are struggling and need to distribute more responsibilities more fairly. If you are unsure of how to all to your supervisor about this, figure out which professor is the \"associate graduate chair\" or similar title. Their job is to help you in these situations. Often students wait till they are in outright conflict with supervisors before accessing the graduate chair. This is not bad, but the graduate chair will often be able to be more effective before it reaches that point in just teaching you the soft skills people who have family in academia already often have.\n\nThe other thing you're talking about, namely confidence and your self worth, unfortunately I can not give you advice in. I can only say that by admitting you your program already believes you are capable of doing this. So you should not take this setback as a referendum or judgement of yourself: it's a setback and that at most. In the long term you need to reach out to your school's health and wellness clinic and see if they can give you mental health support through counselling or therapy. In a counselling session you'd have a very safe space to explain your feelings and will likely be offered techniques and practices to boost your positive self image while not allowing your negative thoughts to dominate your mind. However the quality of these services can vary depending on where you are. You also may need to seek help outside the university if you'd like help in your native language or from someone with a similar cultural background (not necessary but can help).\n\nGood luck, and please take care of yourself first and foremost!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/sz2mqa/i_failed_my_phd_candidacy_exam_the_first_time/hy6ztyl/"}, "5366": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1645674963, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yeah, ive kinda accepted that there\u2019s no winning with this guy.

Send an email or MS teams chat or whatever *work* communication platforms you use, this also protects your SIL because anything written in email is a paper trail that your employer can access. Also, waiting to send an email the next day lets you cool off and think clearer. Don't text your ex-drunk, don't check your work communications angry.\n\nSecond - If you message someone to discuss something, you set a time and you discuss it then. You do not lay out your issues and your argument against those issues and everything else. You do not start a conversation where the other person will open their phone and find out they're already 50% of the way into an argument, and they've not said anything. This is just good advice for general interpersonal communication.\n\nThird - Your SIL is not \"merely asking for assistance\". She is 1)  is asking to be told she is correct and both her supervisor and myself can see this. 2) She is saying that *other people* are at fault and they are wrong. She appears to be offloading as much individual responsibility as possible, whilst simultaneously demanding that the she be told how good her own decisions are.\n\nYou can't have both. You can be the responsibility of a supervisor who helps you and whos advice you listen to... Or you can go your own way.\n\nLast - I just do not believe that your SIL genuinely doesn't know what's wrong the tone of those messages- \"Can I get an update here?\" - Book a meeting, or get an update when you get an update.

I am very clear about what to do and would like him to follow the steps and by the end of project, we may have some interesting results. While the student is nice and hard-working, he does not communicate effectively with me. For example, we discussed on what to do for the next week but the next week he often returns something different from what we agreed. I told him to ask me for help whenever he needs, but he never asked me for additional time or clarification. I gave him good scores in the end because of the effort he spent in it but the project does not lead to a meaningful output.\n\nThe very next semester I supervised another student for a similar project. This student does not have background knowledge either but performs much better because he actively asks questions, looks for my help when he is in trouble, corrects the mistakes, and reports his progress in a timely manner. This project went smoothly in the end.\n\nSuch contrast brings me to rethink my past project experience when I was a master's student or junior PhD. I found I often run into the first student's problem too ---- work very hard but does not ask questions, often misunderstood the intention of my supervisor, and eventually deliver things not up to my supervisors' standards. Luckily, my supervisor is very nice and patient with me which I would forever appreciate. It took a long time for my research to back on track.\n\nFor your SIL, I think the problem may be similar to my first student.

One group that very easily gets into top journals with easy to answer reviews and one that really struggles with long review process and don\u2019t take criticism well. \n\nThe biggest difference I found between working and reviewing papers from the two groups is the clarity - do you feel like key information is hidden or key sections of the methodology or results are not explained in a way that is easy to understand? For bad papers, I look for terms used in a context I don\u2019t understand, for example the other day I saw \u201cnormalised data\u201d on a parameter that usually doesn\u2019t need post processing but then the paper doesn\u2019t explain how the data is \u201cnormalised\u201d. This can often be done on purpose to hide poor research practices. \n\nFor good papers, you\u2019ll find it much easier to imagine recreating studies or reusing the findings for your future learning, whether it\u2019s because they publish clearly their inputs and provide raw data, define clearly their uncertainties, give every equation in supplementary etc. and while most poorer groups will not falsify data, but they will take shortcuts, cut corners or use incorrect method hidden behind lack of detail, vague or weird terms etc. \n\nThe best papers study something step by step and make you invested in the story. They set a problem, then they look at the data, identify a new/weird effect and then\u2026 THEY DIG DEEPER until they find the root of cause of the effect.

I have a job lined up starting two weeks post-defense. It has *nothing* to do with my dissertation research. I was voluntold to take over some work from a staff scientist who, frankly, sucked, and I gained experience in something I thought was worthless academically since it wasn't something I could publish. Except it gave me extremely good experience in a high-demand field for the biotech industry.\n2. I disagree. I've learned a ton about my field in general, and have become an \"expert\" in multiple aspects of it. But I also focused on applied research, not theoretical work - which means that the skills I learned are more broadly applicable. But that was a choice I made within the first semester of being in grad school, since I wanted to do research that actually has uses, rather than working on \"pure science\".\n3. A PhD matters when it comes to how high up the ladder you can scale. I have friends working in industry positions where they've hired people with PhDs is completely unrelated fields - as long as they have the prerequisite skills otherwise. But I agree that just having a PhD doesn't automatically get you a job.\n4. I wasted most of my 20's working regular jobs before going to academia, and while I did get technical skills from that, I specifically did not want to continue doing a soul-crushing meaningless job. So in my personal case, it's been the exact opposite experience.\n5. Having to go back to get another degree is definitely tricky. But it's not just on a PhD level. I know people who got bachelor's degrees that turned out to be less-than-useful, who then went in for a completely different undergrad degree.\n\nI think what's hurt you the most is that you did completely theoretical work. I took the opposite approach, I specifically wanted to do applied research since I wanted there to be real-world uses for what I was doing, rather than devoting myself to \"pure science\".\n\nFrom an employability perspective, that's really worked in my favor. Could I have done something more exciting in grad school? Probably. But you have to balance that with career goals.\n\nI don't really have any good advice, though. I've known people who've done multiple postdocs, and some who went to industry and came back to do postdocs afterwards - but it honestly didn't work out well for any of them. Also, if you really want to continue in your specific field of expertise, you might have to go overseas - Europe and the US have a lot of research funding as well, so that might be where you should look.

I'm just going off of the information you provided in your post and thus, take my comments with a grain of salt. I obviously may not have the full story or may be unaware of key bits of information that you have not shared.\n\n1. **The reputation of the site itself holds no weight.** If your an academic or someone who is looking into becoming a professor/teacher, you don't consider a website like \"ratemyprofessor\" as a reputable site or a key barometer for determining a professor/teacher's ability or knowledge. Ask yourself, who is that website's key demographic? I can tell you, it's not professors, teachers, school administrators, department chairs, or any important players in observing the quality of teaching given by an individual or determining whether to give someone tenure or not. It's literally college students in the 17-21-year old range who in many cases, (**1**) highlight the degree of ease of a course, (**2**) homework load, (**3**) offering their subjective opinion on a professor based on a few arbitrary factors, and (**4**) in a lot of cases, nobody posts on that site unless they have a reason to negatively slander a professor and use the site as an outlet to take out their frustration on said professor. I know for a fact there are professors on that website from my university's department who have some pretty shit reviews, but are professors who I respect and get along with fine. I myself, even took some courses with some of these professors whose teaching style was different, unorthodox, or perhaps utilized a style that was not my preferred teaching style, but that is not a reason to dislike them or call into question their ability to teach. In my opinion, the difference between undergraduate me and doctoral me is (**1**) I still had not developed the skill of adaptability as an undergraduate (such as adapting to different teaching approaches/styles), (**2**) Still thought my time/schedule was the center of the universe, (**3**) I thought professors needed to always accommodate me and my schedule, (**4**) and most importantly, I hadn't yet developed the ability/skill to **self-reflect** and determine whether my actions and demands for a professor/course were appropriate or not. I don't want to generalize, but a lot of undergraduates will throw around the \"not being flexible,\" \"not being understanding/empathetic,\" \"being discriminatory/not inclusive\" and \"being an asshole\" card against a professor if they don't get exactly accommodated in the way that they want. Many undergraduates and quite frankly, posters on a website like \"Ratemyprofessor\" have not yet developed the ability of self-reflection, nor possess the insight yet to determine how some of their actions and demands toward a professor may come off as entitled, demanding, too self-reliant (or dependent) on a professor, and lazy.\n2. **Your own personal experience with a professor/dissertation advisor is your most important determining factor on whether to change or stick with a dissertation advisor**. While I respect other's opinion or input on a professor (classmates, other professors/co-workers), we all have different experiences with professors. It's funny sometimes how you can take all the same courses over your 2-years of doctoral coursework with your cohort mates and develop completely differing opinions/views and experiences of the course/professor themselves. Ultimately, it's your own experience (and nobody else's) with your dissertation advisor that you should rely on to determine whether to stick with him/her or not.\n3. **Ask yourself: what type of support do I need during the dissertation stage.** We all have different demands and types of support we need and require of our dissertation advisors (or professors) that may differ from other students/cohort members. When my first dissertation advisor left in the midst of me working on my chapter 2, I was handed over to another professor in my department without my consent (not that I had any input in the decision anyways). I had taken a course with this professor and personality wise, I liked him a lot. However, I knew damn well we just didn't mesh in regards to working with one another. I needed a dissertation advisor who would provide a little more hand holding and someone I could contact and meet with every month (for a dissertation check-in). This professor had a pretty substantial reputation from faculty/students alike for never checking his E-mail (was true when I took his course :D) and due to his responsibilities as department chair, his time was limited. Thus, I made the decision to change to another professor whose work style was similar to mine and availability was keen to what I required for this stage in my doctoral journey. The piece of advice I always offer students who are going to start looking for dissertation advisors is ask yourself: **do I trust this person (dissertation advisor/professor) to get me out of here in 5-years (At my institution, we have 5-years to finish our dissertation, this is after our 2-years of coursework)?**\n4. **Ask yourself: what type of professor personality do you need?** I think what's important to ask about yourself is what are your strengths and weaknesses as an academic and what professor will compliment your strengths, as well as put you in a situation where your weaknesses can not be exposed. In my case, I have a tendency to procrastinate and due to my learning disability, I am slower at formulating and developing my writing than others. Thus, I chose a dissertation advisor that set realistic and achievable deadlines in regards to me as a student. Furthermore, he has an easy going personality and offered me the monthly check-ins I needed to reassure me that I was on the right path in terms of my dissertation progress. I'm not sure a professor who set hard/fast deadlines and was very critical of my work would have been a good fit for me. There are definitely professors in my department like that who have a \"one size fits all\" model of dissertation advising, who expect all their advisees to submit a given chapter in the same amount of time as all their current/previous advisees and if you don't, you get hit with the \"well (insert name) was able to do it.\" They usually get their dissertation advisees out pretty quick because of the fast, streamlined dissertation deadline style, but in talking with these people, their lives are absolute hell for 2/2.5 years because of the constant pressure to meet these deadlines.\n5. In terms of your feelings of inadequacy, I mean, if you made it to the dissertation writing stage, it shows your capable of doing doctoral-level work and you can complete many of the aspects required for writing a dissertation: literature review, methods, findings, etc.\n\nGood luck OP, you got this.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/t1emdm/my_advisor_has_a_terrible_rating_on_ratemyprof/hygn4tj/"}, "5982": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "gradthrow59", "Date": 1645840936, "Score": 9, "Body": "Just second this, as an \\*ahem\\* previously incarcerated person (which is really hurtful, as OP seems to imply you can't get much lower than this!)\n\nI met an advisor at my current school and worked there for several years, building a consistent track record, and he went to bat for me *hard* to get me into school.

I was extremely excited to work at a lab and have my own work station. My guide setup bu weekly connects and prescribed me courses. So far so good.\n\nIt's downhill from there. I found the course work very tough. Eventually I had nothing to discuss in my meetings with my guide. He would often state that there were other students in his lab who could cope so it was down to my lack of focus...\n\nHe asked me stop meeting him and concentrate on studies. My  performance declined even more. I stopped going to classes. Eventually my grades fell so much that I had to quit my program (read thrown out).\n\nI was lucky enough to get a decent job but I will always regard it as my failure.\n\nNow I have joined graduate program a one of the biggest research universities in western new york. I'm very close to Niagara. I've recently taken interest in a new area. I'm doing fairly well and have bi weekly connects with the professor. Now I'm planning to join his group after this semester but nothing is confirmed yet. He's asked me to speak to him a month later about this but I feel very good about it.\n\nSo I was depressed when I was in a phd program vs I'm happy now when nothing is sure. What's the difference?\n\nPhD is very absolutely 100% your work, your commitment. There's no doubt about that. If you fail your courses it's completely on you. But I personally think a good guide is very approachable and not intimidating. That you can speak to them freely about things other than academics. Also they understand everyone studies, deals with academics differently. I'm sure my previous guide would have successful students too. He's very good in his work and will find students to match his frequency. But I just hope that he was a bit more approachable.\nIn my opinion good guides don't give up on you that easy. They want to see you succeed and not just need it from you. Its personal for them too. You see they spend so much time selecting their candidates that once in, they treat you like a friend.\n\nAt this point I'm yet to restart my phd but I have friends who've completed theirs and they say they loved going to their labs and have meetings. Those who are still stuck with their phd say they hate meeting their guides. I'm sure all of them have gone through equal amounts of tough times and have been stuck equally too. The difference was the first set of friends were so happy discussing that with their guides whereas others thought it as a burden, or hoped to show significant progress every meeting. That's not possible. At least for an average student.\n\nPeople often remark that you should do phd in a subject that interests you. While that is true they never tell you you're bound to get disinterested in that subject at some points in your career and get saturated. These are the kind of things a good guide helps you tackle.\n\nOf course there's no litmus test. I've seen good professors /researchers with phd students stuck for 6 - 7 years. I've also heard of groups where students are out of the gate after 4 years and extremely impact full work. Its all very subjective.\n\nBut I think approachability is a good starting point.\n\nAll the best.\n\nTl;Dr - approachability, general lab vibes, support during course work, feedback of ex students.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/t2i6up/what_makes_a_good_phd_advisor/hymf4fg/"}, "6294": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "just_found_one", "Date": 1645952057, "Score": 9, "Body": "How he treats his students.

Not once in my PhD have I ever been glad to have carried on working for an extra hour past when I normally finish, and not once have I ever regretted closing the laptop and just going to sleep even if I haven't finished what I was hoping to finish. PhD life has made me love and appreciate sleep so much I can't even tell you. \n\n-- Establish a sustainable and steady working routine that you feel is comfortably within what your highest potential workrate could be, rather than going gung-ho for intensity. If you feel like, yeah, if I really push myself hard I can work for nine hours per day five days a week, dial it down and say, okay, I'll do seven and a half hours a day for four days a week and maybe just seven on Friday. Or if eight hours per day is your cut off point for productivity, make your usual working day seven hours. That way you'll always give yourself the leftover energy you need to actually have a leisure life once you've closed the laptop lid for the day. And you're not starting your PhD with a working pattern that you're going to have to adjust in a couple months when you realise you just don't have the stamina for it. \n\n-- don't let the perfect or even the good be the enemy of the finished and the on-time. \n\n-- friends and hobbies: you need these more, not less, as you get busy with PhD work. \n\n-- when work feels like hell, being outdoors will save your soul. \n\n-- make your work space a glorious, inspiring, joyful, and energy-driving place to be. If you use a laptop, invest in something like a roost stand and a separate keyboard and mouse. Your PhD will only last a few years but your spine needs to last the rest of your life, so make sure you're looking after your spine before you start typing out those numbers or whatever it is our good friends who do MechE do.\n\n-- Even once you get your perfect ergonomic desk set up sorted, get up and take a walk every thirty minutes if you can, whether you're on a roll with work or whether you've hit a roadblock. Combine that short break and walk with getting water and drinking that water. The brain needs water, sleep, food, and rest: give it all those things, and it'll give you the goods in return. Deprive it of these things, and you'll reap a poor harvest. \n\n-- in your spare time, read about and feed whatever intellectual interests or curiosities you have outside of your specialist field, even if it's something absolutely unrelated to your entire discipline. Give you brain a chance to remember that thinking doesn't just have to mean being bogged down in this super specialised project you're doing that only two people are going to read ever anyway, but that it can also mean just jumping into and skipping around merrily as can be in the whole vast field of accumulated human knowledge and understanding, with no expectation of actually becoming an expert or professional in anything but just a tiny tiny corner of it.

Often staying at the same school is way easier because you don't need to do qualifiers but at the same time you'll have the option open to amicably separate from your MS advisor and pursue a new mentor for your PhD without the very unpleasant and aggressive situation some of my friends dealt with when they left their abusive mentors in the department and went to different schools.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/t2y3cb/going_straight_from_bs_doctoral_work/hyqkfsg/"}, "6492": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Mstar51", "Date": 1646021947, "Score": 176, "Body": "All I can say is this too shall pass.

This will be really really useful to you because you can also see what kinds of activities they've done during their PhD, like publications, conferences, research fellowships etc: as the other comments have said, these things are just as essential for getting a TT job as having gone to a top university, so it'll be good for you to get a sense of just how much of those activities you realistically need to be looking at doing to be competitive on the job market.   \n\n\nThis won't directly help you, but an interesting little informal survey you could do would also be to look at the CVs of the oldest faculty members of those same departments, and see where they did their PhDs. If sociology is anything like the fields I'm familiar with, I would strongly expect the older generation of sociology faculty to have done their PhDs at a quite wide variety of different types of university in terms of \"prestige\" or league table ranking, whereas the recently-hired faculty will have overwhelmingly all done their PhDs at only a very very small number of the most \"elite\" universities. It'll give you a picture of the job market and how it's changed.   \n\n\nAlso just a caveat: my sense is that the guidance you've received from the other comments that a PhD from a top university is basically essential for a TT job (which I imagine would be supported by doing the kind of thing I've described above) applies to a much greater extent in the United States than in say the UK, where (at least in my field) you do see early career academic posts going to people who've done their PhDs at a much wider variety of universities than just the top ranked ones. So if you're outside the USA, then doing that kind of \"survey\" of CVs of recent academic job hires in your field becomes even more useful to see what the picture is like in your particular country of study.  \n\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/t36yfn/program_prestige_and_job_prospects/hyrlonl/"}, "6544": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "doornroosje", "Date": 1646048007, "Score": 1, "Body": "Cause my PhD is about war anyway", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/t2sxtf/how_do_you_focus_on_your_phd_work_when_ww3_is/hyrlztn/"}, "6545": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "phdemented", "Date": 1646050570, "Score": 2, "Body": "Nope...

Your department should have procedures for students needing to take time off and resume their studies at a later date. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA PhD is a marathon not a sprint. You\u2019ve got to pace yourself, be very careful not to over-commit, and be very vigilant about keeping your working hours under control. There\u2019ll be plenty of time to spread whatever papers, reviews, and publications you decide to do over the course of your programme, but when you do them assume everything is going to take much longer than you estimate because generally it always does. There\u2019s really no need to try to cram as much in as you can in one go, especially if you need to do a part time job on the side to support yourself financially.   \n\n\nlook after yourself and good luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/t3lxy2/burnt_out_in_second_semester/hyt8evf/"}, "6611": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "gamecat89", "Date": 1646074638, "Score": 5, "Body": "I'm not surprised.
