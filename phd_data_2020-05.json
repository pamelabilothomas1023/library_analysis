But, if you do, I think it's better if it's something related to academic research (not an MBA, for example) and the skills and experiences that would be useful for your topic of interest for research.\n\n2 - Yeah. I don't know any decent PhD program in business in the US that do not require the GMAT or the GRE. So, you should take at least one of them. Also, you should get a very high score. Business-related PhDs are very competitive, it's easy to see applicants who have a score higher than 700 for the GMAT, for example. \n\n3 - Hard to answer. The selection of schools is one of the hardest parts of the process. If your topic of interest is quite common, then you should be able to find many schools that would suit your needs in that regard. But maybe your interests are something rare, with fewer schools doing research about that kind of topic. \n\nAnd there are other factors that can influence that decision. Some people don't want to apply to certain places, because of the climate, culture, etc. \n\nBut, for PhDs in business, I see people applying to a lot of schools. 10 would be a low number, maybe around 15 would be common. \n\n4 - Schools can have very different ways to evaluate applications, different criteria, etc. \n\nSince they get many applications, the GMAT/GRE score is often used in the beginning, to distinguish who seem to be the top applicants. It's often the only thing that can really be compared directly and easily. \n\nBut of course, a high score is not enough.\n\nLetters of recommendation can be very important. If you have strongly positive letters of recommendation from researchers who have a good reputation, they can help a lot.\n\nResearch experience is another important factor. If you have worked as RA before, if you have a paper, if you have a conference presentation, etc. \n\nAnd you are expected to show you are a good fit for the school. What makes you an excellent applicant for that school, compared to other schools? So, the Statement of Purpose is also important.\n\nOf course, you don't need to have a perfect profile to be accepted. But those things can make a huge difference.\n\n5 - \"Have to quit\" may be too extreme. But at least you are expected to. A PhD is more like a job than a degree. You are there to not only study, but to work. \n\nYou work a lot, and you get paid (not a lot). So, if you do a PhD while you have a job, it's like having two jobs. Not an easy thing to do. Especially when one of those jobs (the PhD one) can require you to work for extremely long hours and deliver amazing results in a short period of time. \n\nNow, it's not necessarily bad all the time, but I don't recommend underestimating the effort you need to put on your work while you are a PhD student. We have brilliant people, with major accomplishments in life, very competent, who struggle hard. \n\nThe application process can be overwhelming indeed.

That was another thing that was blocking me. I didn\u2019t have very hand on supervision most of my PhD and when it was time to finish, I was afraid of showing my work to my boss\u2019s boss because I thought my work was crap and had to perfect it before presenting.

First, be generous with yourself, don't set unrealistic goals that you can only achieve through unnecessary pain and stress. Just take one day at a time, but have some sort of plan that can guide you priorities. Don't let yourself feel bad about the work you've done. In my opinion, the fact that you see flaws in your project says that you matured enough to graduate from your lab. Most likely, no one in your place could have seen the right way to design the experiments a priori, without going through getting your unique experience. That doesn't make you a disappointment, that makes you an expert and can open new opportunities after you graduate. Write a list of 10 things that you're most proud of, from all of your PhD accomplishments, and stare into the list each time you feel bad about your work. \n\nFrom what you say about your supervisors, they seem to be fine with your progress. Otherwise, they would let you know. They might be less involved in your work now than before, making you feel more alone than ever. However, this is a good sign: It means you are trusted as an independent researcher. Try to find inspiration for writing the text as quickly as you can, although (unless you have a hard deadline) write with a steady pace, don't force it too much each day as this is exactly what can cause burnout. \n\nFinally, don't forget that your specialty is not just to write, not just to present, and not just to set up experiments. Doing research is a combination of things, perhaps one of the most complex intellectual activities. From what I've observed so far, good researchers don't have to be excellent writers, and they must care about the quality of their texts to an extent that is pragmatically justified. If you're worried about your writing skills, this likely indicates that you're making progress. \n\nYou can do it.

Thanks for chiming in. The opportunity cost is definitely weighing on me - It's particularly hard to judge because I feel there's a good likelihood the economy is going sideways for the next couple of years (e.g. a great time to get halfway through a PhD or an MBA).\n\nCan I ask a couple of questions? Namely:\n\n* Why do you say a PhD is a ceiling cap? There are quite a few organizations in my area (e.g. innovation hubs, consulting firms) that are run by people with PhDs. It may be that they were hired in spite of that credential, but I wonder what motivates that statement. Just to back that up, here are a couple people with PhDs in roles in consulting that I think are pretty sweet: \n   * [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahdchapman/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahdchapman/)\n   * [https://www.linkedin.com/in/lui/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lui/)\n* Do you say \" You'll be missing out on that end career comp if you take the time off. \" from the perspective that 'taking the 4-5 years off' is enough to derail that possibility? My program is strongly oriented around maintaining a (part-time, as available) consulting setup, particularly beyond the first year, but it's not the same as full-time. It could be that you get cut off at the knees here, but then again I may already be there - I'm mid 30s and I'm not at MBB etc, - I'm independent. \n* I've also constantly come back to the MBA idea. However, I find the research is pretty clear that if you're not getting in to the top couple of programs in your country or the top \\~10 in the US, the value drops off. Is this something you considered?\n* Given your current income and what you feel is your trajectory, can I ask why you'd go for the PhD? If it's just for personal satisfaction, wouldn't it be better to double down on your career now, make some cash, invest it, and have some great accomplishments, call it an 'early retirement' and jump out in your late 40s-ish to do the PhD? I think if I was in your situation, it's something I'd be strongly considering. Or, Negotiate a part-time option for a couple years and do independent research similar to [https://nadiaeghbal.com/phd](https://nadiaeghbal.com/phd) or similar? Or get a professional doctorate based mostly on your consulting?\n* For me, what I'm seeing is that my career is hitting a wall - I can't earn more than I'm earning now without a lot more experience, an MBA, possibly a PhD, or a lot more connections. The PhD provides a lot of connections (because of the way it's structured with various placements at various companies), but it's not the perfect solution.

But if you're average or below average you're looking at $150-200k I'm not saying this is a bad thing... it's absurdly good money. But, it is a cap nonetheless. Of course you can consult while you work in academia but the time you spend consulting is time you're not spending doing research. Of course, there are any number of roles you can do with a PhD in business, but PhD's are geared towards research - if you want more money, but not to do research - do an MBA. \n2. Nothing is impossible and nothing is guaranteed. But, consulting is an up or out business. If you miss 4-5 years, you're likely to come back in at a level you may have surpassed otherwise. Not only that, if you're looking for exit opps, the years in your 30's are key years to find those and still build a career elsewhere. \n3. I took a different route in lieu of an MBA. I wanted to specialize and, therefore, got an MSc... and then got a second MSc... One of which is from the London School of Economics in a field in which they are currently #2 globally.

If you are top of you class at a mid-range MBA, you're still going to get paid well but your average is floated in with the rest of your cohort.

I fell in love with theory at LSE - I don't get the same satisfaction from consulting that I do from conducting research. Given that I have 30+ years of working life left, I figure I shouldn't waste 15 years of doubling down on work doing something that satisfies me less. I'm in a fortunate position to make more money than most at my age and have the luxury of this choice. \n5. If you want the best ROI, period, end of story do an MBA. Bust your ass, score higher than 700 on the GMAT and go to a T20 B-School and your earning potential will be what you make it. B-School is a 2 year networking event with optional classes baked in.

I think you would have better chances of speaking with specific professors and then applying to the \"regular\" (not online) program, and discussing ahead of time with the professor that you would only accept the position if you can work remotely. Some very good advice that I got when I was applying for PhD's was that you should NOT be applying to programs, you should be applying to work with specific professors. If you find a professor who is a good research fit with you, they may be willing to let you do a lot of your PhD offline, once you are a more independent researcher (which most people are not going to be at the beginning of their PhD!!!!)  \nThat said -- it seems to me that you have some misguided views about how the PhD system in the US work, as well as its goals. A US Phd is NOT 7 years of doing \\*research\\*.  It is 2\\~3 years of courses and exams, and then followed by years of research. Arguably you could do some of the courses online, especially since covid is forcing everybody to adjust to online classrooms, but you will miss out on a lot of very important social aspects of a PhD that 100% do help you learn how to do research. Soooo many people with masters degrees think it will be easy to jump into a PhD, but doing research and doing masters level thesis projects are worlds apart. I think the hesitancy for people to let you do an online PhD largely stems from this.   \nAs for \"being on the hook for physical labor\" -- these things that you dont want to do are just PART of doing a PhD. The \"menial task\" of grading papers... oof. If you really want to do a PhD, get rid of that additute, and just accept it. Part of getting a PhD is that you need to learn to teach, because getting a PhD is essentially the process of learning how to be a productive member of academia (whether you say there or go into industry is another thing). Yes, I definitely get annoyed that I have to teach some days, instead of spending the extra 2 hours on my paper, but this is how a PhD goes -- this is how academia works until you're a tenured professor. Why should YOU get funded for a PhD without any teaching responsibilities, when most professors don't get that :P ? If you want to just do research for 7 years with no teaching or other PhD duty responsibilities, i'd recommend you look into R&amp;D jobs with the DoE or VA and skip the entire PhD degree entirely. You don't need to have a PhD to get a cool job doing research there.    \n\n\nAnyway, I hope I don't discourage you by being a neigh-sayer, but I do think you need to be a bit more realistic. Maybe the whole covid thing will actually make it more likely for PhD's to become more of an online thing. Ultimately, I hope you can find a professor who you really want to do research with, and work it out with them :-).

Being intimate enough with a topic to teach at that level is a feat on its own.  Teaching will definitely highlight your weak points.\n\nWe're on the same page, as far as what a doctorate program consists of.  Granted, not personally on my part since I haven't attended.  But I am aware that the first 2-3 are actual coursework.  I actually look forward to that part as well.  I would be even more excited about the benefits of face-to-face interactions with professors and cohorts, but it isn't really a possibility to attend on a campus within the next 6 to 7 years, and I really don't want to sit around that long waiting until I can.\n\nI guess the crux of the issue is, I can see the value in teaching and grading, but it's not something I'm able to do in a distance program.  Because I can't perform those tasks, professors I have reached out to aren't interested in providing funding, regardless of the research topic and how closely it relates to their own research.\n\nI do understand they only have so much money to work with, and not being able to do those things makes me less attractive as a PhD candidate.  But, I didn't ask for a stipend or even full tuition.

I think service to journals or conferences as a reviewer (if grad students can apply in your field) might give you a chance to talk with more senior reviewers about the possibility of nudging and, if not, at least help you immerse yourself in lots and lots of upcoming research to get acclimated to nomenclature and norms.\n\nRegarding the figures, how would you feel about using the traditional ones and supplementing with something you would like to move towards?

She would tell me to do something or write something and forget what she told me then yell at me for doing it.  Any written work was \u201cshredded\u201d and she would laugh about how horrible the paper and how much she had to rewrite ! I recorded our conversation to revise exactly as she dictated it.  Made no difference.  She forgot what she dictated and shred it again.  She would say to my face that I would not finish and no matter how hard I worked it was not enough because i could not write and I could not think.  I had to take Prozac because my anxiety was through the roof.  Thinking about talking to her made me ill.  Finally I finished my course work and sat for my candidacy exam.  In one week I had to write a grant proposal, analyzed and critique a research article, read an article and write a letter to the editor of JAMA and design a protocol for another research question -  all in 7 days in within specific criteria. The pressure was unbelievable.  I barely slept - the task was impossible.  I never wrote a grant my entire program and my quantitative research methods course was weak.  No surprise I failed.  I had a year to try again. I retook another research methods course.  My advisor took the opportunity to berate me the entire year.  I went to therapy, hired a dissertation coach and a stats coach.  I rewrote the exam questions from the previous year with my coach.  Nothing helped.  My advisor refused to meet with me or help me prepare for the second try.  If I attempted to ask questions she would not answer me or make an excuse NOT to meet with me.  Mind you I was making my second and last attempt to pass my candidacy exam.  My questions were related to in-depth concepts and guidance for approaching my exam.  Nope nothing   Even if I got an answer it ended up to be incorrect or not helpful.  My second exam was 4 questions including a grant proposal on a topic that I was completely unfamiliar and never touched upon in my program.   I asked questions via email about certain aspects of the exam.  (Which I was told that I was allowed). Advisor refused to answer   I failed again. I was asked to leave the program.  I left after 50 out 60 semester hours   Normal  protocol and mentoring did not exist there.  Also I was not in a position to switch advisors.  My advisor held all the power in the department and switching would have been suicide anyway.  I was trapped with narcissist personality disordered bully.  I was forced out.  When my advisor told me to leave ( which I had no choice ) one of the other faculty was in the room and she cried for me.  \nIt was a horrible painful experience.  I never failed academically and had a 3.7 GPA  going into candidacy.  Nothing made sense.  She wanted me gone and made the exam impossible to pass 4 15 page in-depth papers in a week -  who does that to students?\nThe next week I applied to 5 new PhD programs and after spending the spring interviewing I was accepted into a new program.  Some of my credits transferred.  Most did not.  I had to start over.  I finished my first year, completed 5 classes with a 4.0.  Miraculously I am excellent writer and critical thinker now. The faculty make a point of complimenting my work and encouraging me.  I am determined to finish this program and earn my degree.  I heard the candidacy is one question with 2 writing weeks and a chance for a revision of the question.  Wow now that makes sense.  I stopped taking Prozac but I continue therapy.  I have a lot of baggage for 5 years of gaslighting.  I wonder why this happened to me.  I guess there is no answer and I will never know why\u2014 I try not to think about the delay in my career and the additional years earning a \u201csecond\u201d PhD.  I focus on the journey.  I am in completely different environment and I changed the PhD concentration so at least the two programs complete each other.  \nOnly my immediate family knows that I failed twice and a few people at work.  People ask me if I am on the 10 year plan for my PhD likes it\u2019s a big joke.  Well yeah I say actually I am !  \nIf you are in a toxic program with dysfunctional faculty get out fast.  It\u2019s not worth the mental torture - being tough or strong.  It will take me years to recover from 5 years of abuse !  I thought I was taking the high road being the better person - fight till the end.  NOT WORTH IT.   Should have left right away.  I didn\u2019t know any better.

However in Hums, its a much slower process, and I believe its possible that you wont publish your dissertation work until even after your PhD, and that this is actually normal.   \nFunding is another one. Typically, Hums has less funding available and for this reason in some ways is a lot more competitive.

These are the tips that I\u2019ve picked up along the way and I find very useful:\n\n1. If you haven\u2019t already, work out the boundary between literature you are interested in and literature you are not interested in. For example, if you are interested in additive manufacturing of maraging steel, you may decide to limit your literature boundary to just papers talking about AM or maraging steel - or papers talking about all steels - or papers talking about AM of metals and alloys. If you don\u2019t do this at the beginning it\u2019s easy to fall into a rabbit hole and waste precious time!\n\n2. When you find a paper that looks relevant, read the abstract. If this sounds good then read the paper\u2019s conclusions. If this all sounds like something you\u2019re looking for then scan through the rest of the paper (the intro will usually point you in the direction of other useful papers and the methods could give you points on which to critique that particular paper).\n\n3. As others have said in these comments, there isn\u2019t really a need to write lots of notes on each paper once you get going. You start to figure out the general key points from lots of papers saying the same thing!\n\n4. Once you have an idea of the literature and the information that\u2019s available to you do a rough structure of your literature review (or work out the conclusions you want to make that will be backed up by literature) and slot the relevant references in place. Don\u2019t be afraid to evolve this as you go along though.\n\n\nI hope this helps, once you get the hang of it you\u2019ll save time and read lots of literature efficiently :) good luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gny40k/how_to_make_notes/frdawy4/"}, "1965": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "connexin7", "Date": 1590087207, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yay how exciting!

So, take everything I say with that caveat because that might be different for you (ie the topic has greater intrinsic value for you). The more able I see myself, the more motivated and interested I become. With that said, I think that perspective makes it a bit easier for me and more difficult in the sense that I can transform the feeling of inadequacy about my abilities  (self-compassion, meditation, etc) and therefore continue to become motivated and interested but it's an ongoing battle. The PhD has so many different phases and planning stages that, at least for me, there is always something new and potentially add triggering (for me: the sense of tension that arises with being confronted with many, undefined steps that I have to take towards something I must do and almost pathological escape from it ). On the other hand, there is no ultimate 'death' of my interest because it is motivation driven in the way I just explained. DISCLAIMER: your perceptions of your topic will always change so if you are just interest driven, deeply look at how the topic makes you feel, what is important, and if you can 'own' this even after your thoughts and feelings about it change. Does this answer your question? Oh right, are you doing a phd as part of a project or single, American or ...?

I've really had to fall into my pattern (started with working 8-4 now I wake up whenever, work 8ish hours, and sometimes work a couple on the weekends...).

I would really recommend to take full advantage of that during your time there. It is usually possible to simply sit in in classes that you find interesting if you contact the person teaching it before hand, but that may not be your focus while doing your PhD. But they also have a lot of resources to learn skills that you may need for your specific research project. So if you need anything with GIS applications, don't hesitate to contact the digital arch people for help, or if you are dealing with animal bones contact Thijs van Kolfschoten about getting help with their analysis, or Annelou van Gijn for help with material analysis, things like that.

That voice is excellent in finding the right arguments for you to stop. For example, the job market argument can easily be made, and as easily be refuted. It's hard to find which things are true and which things aren't given the state you are in. The state you are in is the only truth, and that requires mental attention in the sense that you should do whatever it takes to take your mind of it.

Mention them to your therapist, you will not get locked up, having suicidal thoughts is common in depression. There are stages of suicidal thoughts to suicidal action, professionals can identify them and explain what is going on.

You should only do one if you love research (I guess the exception to that might be a clinical psych degree). Ask yourself what are you going to use your PhD for? For most that enter programs, it's to try to attain one of the small number of tenure track jobs. Understand that the academic market is super tough, and you can set yourself up by trying to get into the most prestigious program possible (and even then, there's no guarantee you'll land a tenure track job). The worst thing is to land into \"post-doc limbo\" where you are making marginally more than as a grad student, trying every few years to break into a tenure track job, but with no real understanding of when you'll realistically land an assistant professor position.\n\nNow to your plan, I don't think it's a good idea. Again, because if your plan is to go the academic route, it's super competitive in psychology. So you need to set yourself up for success as best as you can.

There is a lot of evidence for this statement. Grab yourself a bottle of vitamin D tablets and start taking some. Personally, I found it made a world of difference. BONUS: It appears that vitamin D is *incredibly* important in reducing the harms that arise from COVID-19 because it really helps to regulate the secondary, acquired immune system (which is what usually causes the real harms to people when they have the virus).\n- Perhaps take acetyl-L-carneting. There is evidence that it helpful in giving you energy, but the evidence is more tentative than that for vitamin D. Personally, I found it made me have much more energy through the day and it made getting to sleep easier.\n- Speak with your fellow students. Tell them how you feel. You might just find that the vast majority feel similar things. There is a feeling that maybe could be called \"strength in numbers\" that makes one feel much less alone. It is a good feeling and it can make things better.\n\nNow, having said my little piece, let me go through a few of your comments.\n\n&gt;I'm supposed to finish a PhD in the humanities this fall\n\nIf you happen to find the actual deadline hard to meet, I can basically promise you that at this stage of your Ph.D. you are essentially *certain* of being granted an extension if you need it.

And another after that.\n\n&gt;I'm super depressed, on the brink of a burnout\n\nRemember that it's perfectly fine to tell your supervisor that you are taking a break of like a month or something. I did this. Another Ph.D. friend of mine did this. It really gives a lot of breathing room. You should consider this if you can. Lots of students and academics do this. It's called a sabbatical or even simply a break.\n\nIf you can take this break, go on lots of walks. Try growing some garlic. Cook some lovely food. Read in the sun. Do things that make you feel good.\n\n&gt;not particularly optimistic about a future in academia or even super excited about the prospect, even if I did get a tt job\n\nTake that when it comes.

Getting a good desk (e.g. https://www.stykka.com/products/staythefhomedesk) and a good chair (e.g. https://www.noblechairs.co.uk/hero-series) helped *hugely*.\n\n&gt;My husband (also a PhD candidate) thinks I should finish the thesis\n\nIt's great that you have a team mate who you know is on your side and wishing the best for you.\n\nIf it helps, I think you can finish it and I think that since you're so near the end of it, that you should. To put it another way: Don't let the fascists win!\n\n&gt;It's not gonna help my on the job market so why I should even try to finish?\n\nDon't be so sure about that. A Ph.D. is a fucking enormous undertaking. Doing part or all of a Ph.D. in any topic says a great deal about your stamina, determination and adaptability.\n\n&gt;At times I feel like if I continue I might sink too deep into depression and get suicidal... \n\nVitamin D. Maybe acetyl-L-carnetine. And take a break of like at least a month if you can. And hey, maybe some [1cP-LSD](http://www.1plsd.to/1P-LSD-Blotter-100mcg/10x-1P-LSD-100mcg-59.html) in the sun to help with your neuroplasticity.\n\n&gt;I know some of this might just be the depression talking but I've been getting help from a professional and I'm on anti-depressants and yeah, it ain't helping.\n\nWell done for taking those steps. It's really hard even to start to take those steps. You must have some fucking strength in you. Keep going with it. Our science on anti-depressants isn't perfect yet and it does take some trial-and-error. If some chemical isn't working (after giving it the time to work) then you tell the professional and you try something else. Also it is perfectly fine to let your supervisor know that you're taking these steps. In fact, it gives your supervisor more power to help you out if you need more time etc.\n\n&gt;This is my first ever Reddit post\n\nHello! Some of Reddit is lovely. Some of Reddit is horrid. Stick with the lovely bits if possible. :)\n\n&gt;I don't really know what I'm after here, advice or just a sympathetic \"ear\"\n\nI hope I've been a little of both. Ph.D.s are a fucking shitshow, but do remember they are a marathon, not a sprint. In any case, I do wish you the very, very best.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gp9o63/im_so_over_my_phd_and_want_to_quit/frm62lv/"}, "2280": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1590294179, "Score": 2, "Body": "\"I was amazed how quickly I was verified in the College database.

You are in a situation where you are tired and it feels like you have a large mountain to climb. Thinking and looking at the top of the mountain will make you more demotivated and lose all your confidence in climbing that mountain. The KEY is to take it step by step. Take small steps. When you finish a step go onto the next step. Don't look at the top of the mountain and just think about your next step. Just ALWAYS think about your next step ONLY!

When companies change hands or close down, they need to do a whole-store stocktake, which is a lot of stuff, so they normally hire a separate company to do it (me!). I worked in a chain of pharmacies, scanning literally every item on the shelves and trashing anything that had been damaged or was out of date. Oh boy, you wouldn't *believe* how out of date some of that stuff is. Pro-tip: **Never take things from the back of the shelf. Only take it from the front.** We're talking stuff that expired in the 90's.\n\nMy main job was less good: drug dealing. The way my state is set up was that drugs would arrive on the coast in the main port of the town where I grew up, and then had to be driven 4 hours to the capital city. So together with my boyfriend, we set up a good name for ourselves in both the port and the capital while I was in high school, and I continued that work when I moved to the capital for university. People in the upper levels of society still do drugs, but obviously they can't go into these low-SES areas and buy it directly. A single deal for something like weed can actually take 5+ hours because they're all so high and live such chaotic lives. So I'd be their intermediary, meaning I sold to heads of departments, heads of colleges, and (of course) students. They'd pay very well for a low-fuss, reliable service.\n\nIt's a real shame I couldn't put that last one on my applications. I co-managed a supply chain reaching over 500,000 people. I dealt with high-stress environments successfully, like being threatened with a knife or having a critical supplier be raided *during school hours*, which meant a whole lot of warnings had to be immediately sent to all their colleagues. I managed customer service, making sure the music in the car was what our dealers liked, making sure cocaine was cut with the right amount of salt so it burned their nose a bit and felt higher quality.

He said he'd love to have grad students studying what I'm studying, and to stay in contact if I need research help, but that he cannot suggest attending his institution for grad school, as a PhD from there would not make me competitive in the job market.\n\nNot everything is doom and gloom though! 60% of historians seeking teaching positions in higher ed in the US get a job, 25% at research institutions (where most historians want to work). I realize that's history and you're in English Lit, but I don't think any field is much worse off than history right now as far as job outlook.

I'm interesting in the intersection of xyz and zyx and how abc might be an influence -- even if it's not quite right, showing that you're thinking in this direction is very helpful).\n\nThe other major thing is being able to demonstrate research potential.

Same with [this](https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2019/12/04/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-marketisation-in-british-higher-education/), worth reading even if you're not in Scotland.  \nThe number of PhD and post-doc positions have increased quite substantially in the last few decades (but the number of people wanting those positions has increased a lot more so it's still rather competitive), but the number of senior academic staff has increased by barely 10-20% in the same time. The number of undergrad students has more than doubled (especially after the gov let unis charge \u00a39k per year but cut a lot of the subsidies; so the admins brought in much more students without paying the lecturers a consummate increase), but the number of admin staff has increased even more and no one is very happy about it.\n\nThey seem to mostly make work for each other, and demand so much paperwork out of the academics that it gets in the way of their supposed jobs. Everyone is very busy making work for everyone else. So much of what they do is designed to look like they are fulfilling some target that gets them on a prestigious ranking. It's not enough to teach X Y &amp; Z, you have to have someone fill out the form saying they teach X Y &amp; Z with a unique twist to bump up the list, then produce a shiny brochure to impress the inspectors when they come round so they'll give you a certificate to stick on the wall all the open day tours will walk past.\n\nThe bit i have direct experience of is outreach. Everyone working in every university's outreach department knows full well that you should target children before they pick their high school subjects, because getting people interested in science only once they're 18 is too late; if they didn't already have enough of an interest to pick the subjects they won't have the qualifications to get in no matter how wide-eyed your expiation of a plasma ball made them \\[if you're ever doing outreach, always have a plasma ball; it never fails - if your subject is entirely unrelated to electricity it might be harder to justify, but it'll be worth it\\]. Unfortunately, everyone also knows that any outreach they do to 11 year olds won't show up as an increase in their university's application numbers for years...so most of their effort goes to lobbying 17-18 year olds to come to their university.   There is a reason every university suddenly started putting a lot of effort into outreach (to the point it was mandatory as part of my CDT training; not that I didn't enjoy it or anything, it was mostly fun).   One of the stipulations in the law that allows a uni to charge \u00a39k is that they must show they are doing a certain amount of outreach to various underprivileged groups. These forms are very long and complicated and, while whatever outreach they spur can only be a generally helpful thing for those kids, there's a generally unspoken acknowledgement that these people would have a far easier time getting into university if the fees weren't \u00a39250. If you, like me, enjoy saying these unspoken things aloud everyone in the office will nod shamefully and say they've tried to set up some sort of bursary grants but Finance never seem to go for it for some reason.

In any case, you should listen to your gut and not do something because you feel it's expected from you. If you think you can't take it anymore, then quit, go find happiness elsewhere. It would be a good idea to look around for jobs and internships just in case.\n\nSolving the problem with your supervisor is tough. From what you describe, she sounds rather difficult to talk to, so I don't know if trying to sit her down for a conversation would be an option. If you can, you would set up a time plan (with April 2021 being the definite end of your PhD). What you want to avoid is being strung along ad infinitum. \n\nFor the time being, I think your first priority should be your mental health. Medication is a powerful tool, but won't do much for you unless the source of your stress is removed. It's not a miracle cure for mental illnesses (it's like a pair of crutches: they prop you up so you can walk, but you still have to do the walking yourself). If anything, it's therapy you need. Does your university have some kind of mental health support office you could contact?\n\nIs there also a way to take a day off here and there? A long weekend away from work and your troubles might do wonders. It can also help you clear your mind and think about what you want to do or not do.\n\nIt's also really, really important to not isolate yourself at work. You mentioned that you're all alone with your project. Does that mean you have nobody else around you to talk to? It helps to exchange experiences with others, even if their work is something completely different. The problems people struggle have rarely to do with their projects, but a lot with their bosses or co-workers. You could join others for coffee breaks, for example, or lunch.\n\nGood luck, stranger!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gr3pri/giving_up_or_pushing_through/fs481o7/"}, "2653": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "just-another-human_", "Date": 1590693648, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you for your answer!\nI'm not sure if we have mental health support.

And the lab is always in the back of my mind, no matter what I do. That internship abroad was a nice break, but now I have a lot of things lined up. But hopefully they will help me find a clearer path for the project so I need to worry less. I think what I need to do is plan everything as detailed as possible, and as soon as she signs it off, finish it before she can change her mind ;) The problems only come up when I need to ask permission to order things because they're expensive.

A while ago we got 2 new postdocs who are very nice, but they're also working on very different things. My problems are often very specific, and the field I'm in has also very specific problems, so there are generally not a lot of people who could even answer my questions. But I guess a lot of people have these problems, especially in small labs. The smaller the lab, the smaller is your pool of experiences. But I guess I'll find a way through.

It's a proper full-time job here, so no tuition and no student bonuses. You need to have done a Master's beforehand (2 years including \\~1 year of full-time lab internships), and labs can afford to have lengthy selection rounds for PhD positions. You work full-time in a lab and are directly supervised by a Post-doc or PI, who has to secure funding before the position is even advertised. Depending on a program, you may be required to do approx. 6 month's worth of master-level courses during those four years, but the scientific output is almost always prioritized. Depending on the field there are also teaching expectations (I have seen anywhere between 0 and 40% of the time). In my direct environment, people work 45-65 hours a week in the lab. \n\nA PhD here is time-limited to 4 years, with a pre-tax salary of \\~30k\u20ac (\\~33k$), post-tax you get approximately 2k\u20ac per month. This is approximately comparable with an entry-level salary for someone with a Bachelor's education in the Netherlands, about 65% of the median income here. In most places, you can live quite comfortable with it, and I understand that in international comparison, this is a luxurious salary for a PhD candidate. You have to pay your own health insurance (all public, approx 250\u20ac/month depending on the package you choose), and some money is deposited into a pension account. Side jobs are either strongly discouraged or explicitly forbidden. \n\nGoing to conferences and workshops is expected (and typically reimbursed within limits), as are at least a couple poster presentations. Some PhDs will have a podium presentation as well, but not all. I would expect that this strongly depends on the field as well. \n\nThe number of publication depends on the field, but in my direct environment 3-4 first author publications are expected during the four years. Not all have to be published, but have to be \"publishable\". In order to actually manage the experimental load, often PhDs directly supervise one or two full-time master stundent interns that work on their project (and become co-authors on the publications), so project management is an important skill to have. Often time, it's 4 years of full-time work, and about half a year of unpaid writing-up afterwards. In fact, many people save money for this period, or rely on unemployment insurance (which pays way less, but is generous compared to e.g. the USA or UK). \n\nThose publications are then bundled into a dissertation, with added foreword and discussion (each about a short article's worth), total between 150 and 300 pages in the life sciences. The dissertation has to be accepted by a thesis committee (including the PI and \\~5 other professors, all in the field, some from abroad). Typically, getting the committee to agree is the trickiest part, they can and will ask extensive rewrites of the non-published chapters. \n\nOnce the committee has accepted the thesis, people typically have 50-100 copies printed and will distribute them to colleagues, friends, family. The thesis has to be defended in public in front of 5-8 \"opponents\", i.e. most members of your thesis committee and a couple of other professors your PI knows. The defense is strictly about the written dissertation, time-limited to one hour (including a 10-minute layperson introduction by the candidate), and is mostly ceremonial. Getting the written thesis accepeted is the tricky part, and most anyone who gets their thesis accepted will pass the public defense as well, even if their performance during the public defense is not great.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gsu8c7/how_is_your_phd_program_organized/fs7r71m/"}, "2758": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "UpstairsSlip0", "Date": 1590770523, "Score": 2, "Body": "I like your attitude :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gsd9go/feeling_frustrated_with_my_supervisors_lack_of/fs7rz3x/"}, "2759": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "UpstairsSlip0", "Date": 1590771223, "Score": 2, "Body": "And here I am, having a reviewer correct my syntax throughout the whole manuscript...

Tuition is \u201cwaived\u201d, i.e., a third party sponsor takes care of it (funding agency typically).\n\nThere are preliminary exams at the start of the program (after the MS that is), during which we get 48 hours to prepare a written and oral presentation addressing a set of 4-5 questions designed by committee members. The exam is brutal, and humbling. Once in, your pay increases a bit, there are no teaching requirements, but if you do decide to teach you make a little extra money on top of the ~$32-36k stipend. You also need to complete one PhD-level class per semester.\n\nOnce the dissertation is complete, it is submitted to the committee members and evaluated for a month.

I didn't, and now that I'm finishing my PhD, I recognize that I should have. I don't regret doing a PhD because so many amazing things have come out of it, but I do regret it as a career decision since I'm moving to the industry. Though, maybe I wouldn't have had the tools to make that decision without having gone through the PhD...\n\nI did a PhD because it seemed like the logical step after finishing my MSc. I did not even think that I wanted to be a professor or work in research - I just thought of it as the next step and then I'd see what I'd do with it.\n\nPhD's are hard. Even for people who get into them for all the hard reasons. So the topic you choose is extremely important. Go for something you really enjoy.\n\nBeyond being the path for an academic career, a PhD can be a great life experience. My program is very well funded and through my PhD I've had the opportunity to travel the world without a single cent coming from my own pocket. That has definitely been the most enjoyable part. I've also met so many smart, interesting people. I joined outreach projects and tried to do more than just research. I even got a husband out of it :P\n\nRegarding the research level, I think it depends a lot on the program. I'm in Europe so I never had any lectures, since day 1 my program was research only. I have to write 4 papers to graduate so yes, that puts some pressure. I do believe that my 4 papers are lower quality than if I've had thr chance to just write 2 or 1 and devote all 4 years to that. But programs are different in that sense as well.\n\nThe only applications I had to write were to conferences. I never had to apply to funding. When you go into postdoc or assistant professor things will change. I see it on my partner - he recently started a tenure track assistant professor position and 95% of his work is now administrative. He's yearning for some time to work on his actual research. I think that once you get tenure this also changes and you can focus more on your science again, but going higher up in academia will always involve a lot of admin.\n\nDon't feel like you just \"have\" to do a PhD. After finishing mine I'll go to a position which I could've gotten just with my MSc. It frustrated me a bit sometimes because the PhD has been so hard on my mental health. But I've also live so many experiences that have made it worth it.
