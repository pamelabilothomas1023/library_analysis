First of all you need to relax. You are just another PhD student in that situation and believe me, we all have felt the same at one point in our careers and the ending is usually very happy.

I did this with my most senior lab mate, we combined each other\u2019s strengths, worked together several experiments and this resulted in me getting three publications as coauthor and three more as first author.  So we doubled our production just by teaming up. Second, don\u2019t dwell too much in thinking your manuscript sucks.  If you did the work and have feedback from your advisor and perhaps some coauthors, you should be good to go.  If they think you still need to polish it up, ask them to be specific and work those areas leaving the rest untouched. Remember that the process of submitting is just the beginning and more feedback will come from the peer review. Third, don\u2019t sweat too much comparing yourself with your colleagues.  They have their own struggles and they work in different areas.  You are working to become the super expert in your problem and your problem only, so get confidence and walk your path.  Fourh, use your advisor\u2019s feedback in your writing.  I owe my ability to write scientific papers pretty much entirely to her.

Or even whether you should or should not do a PhD.  I am not saying I am not passionate about my work or that the people you met were only pretending to have established research goals. Rather, that is not a measure of how successful you will be as a researcher during the course of the program or towards the end of your phd. If you are selected along with the others, that is absolutely a guarantee that you belong in that cohort and whether you talk passion or not you absolutely belong in that space and deserve to be in the program. Many will switch their research profiles and the areas they are so passionate about today might not interest them at all by the end of the second semester. In my experience by the time you finish two years in grad school, the training, as well as the grueling, makes sure everyone is at the same level -- slightly defeated, mostly sleepless and eventually having a once in the semester moment where they will be like \"hey I love my work,\" AND \"i am so glad i am doing this\" but the rest of the time be bitter about their life choices.\n\nBut yeah I agree with some of the comments above. If I were completely happy with my life/work at the moment and was earning enough I would not get into a PhD program just for the sake of it. It is too long and too demanding...

It's totally normal. Nevertheless, asking yourself this question after one month is rather early. \n\nFirst of all, it is important for you to find out why you do the PhD. Are you doing it to go to industry and use it as a tool to get certain jobs/ careers? In that case, in Europe it doesn't matter so much if you are from a first tier or second tier University. Overall, outside of the UK (and probably France; I have too little experiences with the French system to comment on this), the reputation of the University plays rather a minor role for employers. That's at least my experience. In that case, employers are also not going to be too much in-depth interested in the topic of your PhD. They will be probably rather broadly looking for a person that knows a certain method or knows a topic. But he doesn't have to be at the total center of research for that. Just as an example from my field: In most cases an employer would not care if you did your PhD on user- or open-innovation, as long as you have some clue about innovation. So, major take-away here is: Your school and specific topic matter much less if you know that you go later to industry. However, if you intend to stay in Academia, those are some seriously critical question, because they may heavily influence your career trajectory. \n\nSecond, however, that doesn't change your problem that you dislike your topic. Still, it is quite surprising that you know after such a short time that the topic bores you. That means either that you have a very deep understanding of it, which would indicate that this is probably not the most promising research field. Or that you probably should really give it a little bit more time. It took me years to really get my research field and even more to see all of the super interesting questions that have remained unanswered. However, I am a social scientist, so it simply might work differently for us. I would recommend you to be very pragmatic about it: Sit down and try to articulate an exhaustive list of mutually exclusive issues that you have with your research field. And comment on how you can solve those issues. Probably it means more reading, probably it means using a different perspective, probably there are issues that you can only solve by moving to an adjacent field and changing your project. \n\nThird, if you decide to change your research, you will need to ask yourself: \"Am I bored of it because I am really not that much interested in doing a PhD, or would a change of topic really change my problem? There is nothing worse than spending good years of your life on a low salary doing a job that you dislike. To me, it sounds a lot like you are kind of neutral. It sounds like you are okay with doing a PhD because it's a reasonable choice but not necessarily like a deeper wish. That's okay. It can work, but people with such a motivation tend to get faster frustrated. And research processes hold many frustrations. However, if you decide to change the topic, you should be simply upfront about it with your supervisor. A PhD contains per definition flexibility and uncertainty and you are allowed (I would even say required) to shape the direction of it.

A couple of thoughts that might help out:\n\n* Don't worry if you feel like you have no idea where you're heading. Keep reading literature (ask around to see what the foundational/major papers in your area are, and set up some Google Scholar alerts for topics that you find interesting). This is good because when you do start to spend most of your time working on active research, you'll have less time to chomp through stacks of papers. This also makes summarising background literature for papers and reports much easier.\n* Definitely spend a lot of time in the beginning meeting new people and building up some friendships/hobbies. It'll make thing so much more enjoyable as time goes on :) This includes other groups in the area that aren't student-based (i.e. clubs in your city for stuff you're interested in).\n* Like u/slick3rz said, don't make a habit of work evenings or weekends. Sometimes you'll might have to (paper deadlines and such), so take that free time while it's there.\n* Depending on your area/department/university it can also be very easy to fill up your time with teaching, tutoring, and other paid gigs. Be careful not to spend too long doing things that feel like work but aren't required for the PhD.\n* Mental health wise, try and keep track of how you feel about work (like, when you wake up in the morning, how does the thought of going to work make you feel). If you can get into the habit of this kind of introspection it's a lot more obvious if things are starting to slide, so you can do something about it. Often talking to colleagues or your supervisor about what's causing you problems can lead to significant and surprisingly quick improvements.\n* I guess the last one has to be to enjoy it.

Certainly, a lot of us are qualified enough to earn a lot more than the value of the stipend, if we keep working somewhere else.\n\nMy concern is the impact on learning, and maybe mental health. Because, at least here, the real learning comes from doing the assistantship. Coursework helps very little, I learn by doing. \n\nSo, even you don't take the money for the assistantship, I think you should plan to work as if you were an assistant. Otherwise, you are missing what is, for me, the main point of doing a PhD: learn because you are working on research projects with the faculty.\n\nNow, the work of an assistant can easily be equal to a full-time job, or more. So, if you keep working outside the program, it's like having 2 full-time jobs.\n\nI wouldn't be able to do that, without serious problems regarding my learning and productivity in the program. Money would be better, but learning would be awful. Even without an outside job, I really struggle hard.\n\nThings are sometimes different, depending on the field and the country. I know that in some countries, it's more common to see people working while doing a PhD, and the structure of the PhD is quite different from what I experience here.

My university is in a state with a few reported cases and one on campus case (that kind of narrows things down right? LOL) and they're highly recommending students cancel any unnecessary travel. Of course, the faculty are in constant discussion, and my recent committee meeting started late because one of my members is a department chair that just left a large executive meeting on dealing with the virus. Obviously that doesn't work when Spring Break is coming up and undergraduates are pining to get away from the tough winter we just had, so I suspect there will be a large influx of quarantine cases in the next few weeks.\n\nMy point is that, you'll need to keep track with what your university policy is going to be soon and what they're dealing with at the moment. My wife is graduating in May, and we have a few travel plans for upcoming weddings, but we may have to cancel one or two of those plans just because of the climate regarding travel. At this point, I have no plans to walk and I don't want my family to be coming into an airport that's been known to have cases coming out from it.

I'm not sure I'd recommend it, but if you want the PhD badly enough then you'll be willing to fight. \n\nI'd seriously consider the scholarship options in your country, and if you go for it then devote *serious* time to these applications. They can be a huge fucking pain in the ass, and it sucks to spend all this time just to get rejected, but it is necessary to try. I think many non-Western countries have very bad scholarship options (I might be wrong) and then I'd advise against doing the PhD honestly. It's not worth the debt if you have to pay for it yourself.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/fh0xgy/loans_for_first_semester_pursuing_funding_opps_as/fk89e8e/"}, "713": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Outmodeduser", "Date": 1583952162, "Score": 5, "Body": "So bribery to do their job... god academia is the wooooorst.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/fgvgfs/phd_advisor_refusing_to_read_thesis_drafts_if/fk8a0yn/"}, "714": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MysteriousBirdie", "Date": 1583952326, "Score": 4, "Body": "In some cases you can go outside the college if the department head or dean approves.

I mean, the scientific literature is RIFE with speculation - that's essentially what the whole discussion section is about. No one actually knows - that's why we do experiments in the first place. Entire scientific careers and theories have been crushed by the onslaught of new data and information, so just remember that science is in constant flux - even the best, most revered scientific belief can and will be superseded by better speculation, theory, and data. There's no absolute fact, that's why science works better than other forms of dogma. With enough evidence, you are allowed to topple down theories. Think about the Nobel Prize in Medicine when Barry Marshall discovered that H. pylori was responsible for ulcers and could be treated with antibiotics. He literally had to EAT a petri dish of H. pylori to show this because no one believed him and show that he'd get ulcers from it. So it's not just us at the lowly level of PhD defenses - it's the entire scientific system. Without conjecture, really you're just looking at numbers, science has a lot to do with building connections and relationships between different phenomena.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ffse03/a_question_for_students_in_physical_sciences_with/fkb0os8/"}, "764": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "wollst", "Date": 1584027087, "Score": 2, "Body": "I\u2019m having a similar problem!

You generally apply for a fellowship earlier in the graduate school application season which can range from a few essays, to interviews, to videos, to project proposals to combinations of the mentioned. You receive word usually after you have heard back from graduate schools regarding admission. Now some fellowships are tied to certain schools and those can have a different timeline.\n2.

Yes, your advisor has to stay in the department and deal with whatever political ramifications there are but your advisor can also go \"Dear Colleague, my student mgrunnerV is trying to address your concerns with her thesis. Would you please answer her emails? Would you please x, y, z (whatever it is you need this person to do)?\" \n\nIf your advisor can't do that, fuck his bridge. There may be more faculty politics going on that you are not aware of and unwittingly in the middle of.  Defending is not only about defending your work but also defending yourself and how you portray yourself to the rest of the field. \n\nAnd honestly if this is true:\n\n&gt;Luckily my committee chair and advisor are the same person. When I asked my advisor about it he just keeps asking if I\u2019ve heard from her, and I say no.

I wanted to break down crying saying that my dissertation should\u2019ve been a tough part not dealing with scheduling difficulties.\n\nYou advisor is just walking all over you after getting walked on by her. **Get your department chair or OMSBUD office or some other mediator involved and get this solved.**\n\n(I have recently also replaced a committee member. Though I am at least a year out from defending still. I explained my reasoning only when my advisor asked, who thought the why was sound. The rest of my committee hasn't brought it up, and the faculty in question is so self-absorbed/non-responsive I don't think they have even realized yet. Or they straight up don't care.

Get up in the morning, get showered/dressed and whatnot like you normally would do before you leave the house then sit down to do work, trying to keep the same timings as when you're in uni. Have a lunch break, and I find some smaller regulated breaks helps stop me procrastinating so much too.

If you want to do one, you should start making yourself a competitive candidate.  \n\nIt will all depend on where you go, so your first job is to research how PhDs work in different countries.  Then you have to figure out where you might want to go: what type of research are you interested in, and which research groups are the best in the world at that?  I suggest you start looking for PhD positions *now* - not applying yet, but learning where, how, and when diffferent countries advertise them (if they even advertise them), and what skills and experience they're looking for.  In some places you'll have to apply nearly a year in advance.  In others you can just apply shortly before you want to start.  Figure this stuff out now.\n\nFor getting in, you need to think about what skills you need to succeed in a PhD (you can find lots of resources online about this) and then make a plan to develop your weakest ones, and demonstrate your strongest ones.  Your masters is a good opportunity.  Use your time efficiently, develop skills and knowledge in your field, get good grades, and, importantly, take your research/thesis project very seriously.  Your thesis is your chance to learn how to do a high-quality literature search, how to design and plan a project, how to troubleshoot and deal with problems, and how to anayze and write up work.  If you can publish a paper based on your thesis, even better.  You'll possibly need letters of recommendation so make sure you form a good professional relationship with your thesis supervisor.\n\nTalk to current PhD students while you're doing your masters to see how their experience has been.

I'm in the same situation as you are, 3rd year, protein biochemist, day #5 of home office. I was also freaking out at when it started, I'm definitly not done with my labwork and I have only 10 month left for graduation. But after some days at home I saw that home office is a good opportunity for research. I started to put together my literature, this is anyway something I never did properly as I was always focused on the lab.\n\nI started with the literature relevant for a part of my dissertation where I still have some problems to solve (a purification strategy for a tricky enzyme) and I'm convinced that the deep reading I will be forced to do during the next weeks will help me find a solution for this problem. I make notes, add papers to Mendeley and I write some small paragraphs on LaTex for my general introduction and background chapter.\n\nI have to admit that I wasn't too productive the first days. I am very worried about what is happening, also worried about my family and I'm wondering what the world will look like in six months or a year. Working alone in a tiny appartment is not easy. But it could be worse. I think it's okay to accept that the pandemic and possible self-isolation causes a significant amount of emotional stress and we somehow have to cope with it. After some days I see that I'm more and more ok with the situation and I can work more productively.\n\nIf you are in big emotional distress, you might have the chance to talk to someone. My university offers a counselling service on the phone. A lot of private counsellers now also offer their service online.

I had a friend leave after two years because he realized that the kind of job that he wanted didn't require a PhD, and it didn't make sense for him long term to finish.

Health caused a 2 year pause and I had to get extensions on my dissertation. \n\nOriginal dissertation topic was *destroyed* only a couple days after I finished all my PhD Preliminary Examinations which was what began the 4 year maximum to finish a dissertation. I was a political scientist wanting to study how newly empowered democratic parties were interacting with ethnic minorities in Thailand... and then, after my prospectus was nearly complete and my exams were passed, only 2 days after... there was a coup d'etat in Thailand! All democratic parties were wiped away. Political science programs in Thailand shut down. My topic no longer could be used at all. Led to despair, compounded with a family death and growing health problems. I left for two years, tired, sick (literally) and without a real topic. Then I decided to go back. I worked hard, but my health condition messes with my short-term memory now so the dissertation became an immense obstacle to write. I could argue the entire thing, couldn't write it - couldn't even bring myself to care. \n\nI had become jaded. Political science, I had realized, is deeply harmed right now by an obsession with quantitative research and lack of interest in concepts that don't lend themselves easily to quantification or categorization of some kind. I was pursuing a PhD to *teach* at the university level. Luckily, I got 8 years of teaching experience while there, but I found that *most, not all,* professors were far more interested in research and found teaching bothersome and not worth their time. Teaching-oriented professors - what few there were - were outsiders, not held in high regard even if they had top-notch teaching reviews. Competition was cut-throat. \n\nAcademia wasn't what I expected, my illness was worsening and eventually I decided to quit. I mastered out - ie. they gave me an MA in Political Science to join my other MA in International Studies (from another institution). \n\nIt was the best decision I had made in years, and I'm happier for it. The job market is *bleak* (at least for social sciences outside of economics). The stress and depression tied to working towards finishing a PhD is unnecessarily hard on students, who often feel that if they aren't working constantly, rarely sleeping, constantly networking, etc. then they are not doing what they are 'supposed to'. \n\nPhD's aren't about overall intelligence; more about ambition and focus. It took me far too long to realize I was more obsessed with the idea of having a PhD and how it could let me teach - when I realized that I could teach with my experience and existing degrees, it became clear I was in it out of nothing more than pride. That wasn't a good reason to continue for me.\n\nI am not saying quit! I'm saying you should sit back and really assess the situation. \n\nNow that you are familiar with graduate school and PhD programs, rather than having an ideal-type model of it in your mind, is it close to what you expected and wanted? \n\nIs it making you depressed, happy? \n\nWhy do you want the degree? \n\nIs that/Are those reasons sufficient enough to keep going? \n\nI will say that if it is beating you down, making you seriously depressed (as *many* grad students become) then you ought to consider mastering out. It isn't worth being depressed and incredibly anxious over. Especially because after the PhD you likely will be facing the same predicament in seeking a post-doc which is almost required now. And more in finding a job.

Remind yourself to take breaks - daily and at least one entire day a week.

If you have an adviser who treats you like crap its them, not you, and you should find someone new (or someone else to help advise you).

Having weather that benefits my mood benefits my research and productivity. Having natural escapes nearby, like hiking or going to the beach, provide an easy way for me to relax my mind and refresh my attitude towards research and work. Where I went to undergrad I spun myself in circles driving around looking for an escape from the monotonous environment. Rain and cold temps kept me indoors, where I would make myself feel guilty for not getting work done while I was stuck inside. (this virus thing is kinda bringing that back up...) idk maybe I was just making excuses for not focusing.\n\nAs for research, idk maybe you already know the direction you're going. But for me, once I started getting into it and talking to different advisors I ran into at department functions, etc, I found myself interested in doing research that's almost entirely different from what I expected a year ago (I was also in materials, looking at photovoltaics, now I'm doing computational modeling of proteins). So for me, the research part is a bit more flexible. I also tend to believe that the brunt of responsibility for getting an education is on the student, and that the quality of the institution actually has little influence after a certain level. Of course this varies by person and their personal needs. \n\nSo that said, make sure, wherever you go, there's multiple people there doing something you might want to do. Make sure you like at least a couple of those people, personality-wise, and know you'll get along. Make sure the environment will work to keep you happy, and any effects that would reduce your happiness are at a minimum.\n\nMental health is a big deal in gradschool. I'm at a quality institution with very supportive faculty and students, for the most part, and my imposter syndrome still kicks my ass at least once a week.

Another UK PhD currently doing the last bits of research and writing up. I was supposed to have a first draft by the end of June. My supervisor is locked down in Italy.  \n\n\nMy situation is weird: I work from home sometimes, so I'm used to it and able to do it. However, I have to be on campus to access certain things that are central to my research, and I need books that are locked away in an office that I can't get into.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's bad enough being at the end of my PhD, and facing funding running out in September. I already have mental health issues, and can't go to therapy any more, so I've lost some key sources of support. I'm an introvert who cancels stuff all the time, so the pressure to pretend to be normal is off my shoulders, because we're all living like I prefer, but this is a really bad time to suddenly not be able to access essential things.\n\nThe transition was incredibly hard. Our university gave us about four hours between announcing they were shutting down and actually closing everything. I didn't have the chance to get things, and had everything - a lecture, two conferences and two workshops, one of which I had organised and set up - was suddenly cancelled.\n\nI spent all last week working so hard. I wrote 8k words in five days. Now I feel a bit broken. It's hard to work when everything is up in the air. We have appeals to the UKRI to offer automatic extensions because we can't do anything, but nothing has been decided yet. We might not be able to get work next year.\n\nDealing with mental health issues my whole life gives me a bit of an advantage. I know I have to do my running, exercise, meditate. And these external things I can't control, I can just put them down. But there's a kind of constant, grinding anxiety because things are so different, since things that were once straightforward are now really uncertain.\n\nI was due to do an exam in May/June, and I'm desperately hoping they cancel the whole thing and let me off the hook. There is a tendency in academia to see every difficult thing as an opportunity to just work harder. I broke my ankle and was told that since that meant I had to sit down all the time I would have more time to work. Now we're being told we have more time to be productive. There is no sense that the atmosphere we're living in could be making it hard to work and concentrate.\n\nUpside: I have a routine that I'm familiar with, and my partner working at home as well helps. We talk about how we're feeling, and keep diaries about it. Get up, make coffee, work for a bit, stop when it gets hard. Go for a run, do a workout, do a meditation, mix it up throughout the day. Not watching the news all the time is hard but the answer is noticing the urge, and letting pass. And if you can't do that, then consciously allow yourself to look at the news so you can process how it makes you feel.\n\nThe Unf\\*ck Your Brain podcast is doing a series on how to manage your mind in the midst of all this.

So when things started going right for me, my papers I were at the bottom of his pile.

Their work was immediately prioritised, but I guess he risked losing the papers when they moved away and got industry positions.
