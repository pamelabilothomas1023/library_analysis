It depends on your background and what you are looking for.\n\nManagement is separated into OB and Strategy. In the USA alone, there are maybe more than 400 phd fresh grads in Management. And you must consider those from outside the USA, which is maybe another 400. And consider Asst Profs wanting to move. And consider Econs and Pyschology PhDs who are looking for jobs in OB or Quant Marketing or Strategy too.\n\nAnd many of those in AOM are non urgent job posts, which means the uni may be looking to hire in the next 3 years, but they may not hire that year, but is just fishing and seeing what they can get. Unis can always hire adjuncts or someone cheaper.\n\nSimply put, they have great leverage over job candidates, and supply is always far greater than demand overall.\"\n\nAnd you could find work in the private sector, of course. But, generally speaking, doing a PhD for that wouldn't be the best idea. It would be much better to get straight into the private sector. Putting the same amount of effort for the same length of time (5-6 years), you would get a much higher income (you don't get paid much while you're doing a PhD after all), and experience that is more relevant for your career plans. \n\nDoing a PhD is hard work. Really, really hard work. People can easily underestimate it (and I say that after a career of about 20 years in the private sector, an MBA and a MSc). Of course, I suppose you can do it. But should you do it? Is it worth it? Without being committed and certain of what you're doing, after a couple of years you will probably start thinking \"What the hell am I doing? Working insane hours, learning things that aren't going to be useful for me, with a lot of uncertainties about what future opportunities I'll have, and making very little money? While I could be working in the private sector, making more money, buying a nice car, a house, having more chances to think about dating, etc., and having a much better life?\" You'd be right to think like that, and then you see that there are 4 more years of that ahead of you. \n\nThe jobs that we usually get also require 5 years of work experience, The difference is that it's PhD work experience (a PhD is much closer to a job than a traditional degree like a bachelor's or a master's).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/fstbfz/im_thinking_about_applying_for_phd_programs_in/fm3ha0g/"}, "17": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AntiqueMuse", "Date": 1585729229, "Score": 1, "Body": "I am also in theatre!

This helps in building momentum and keeping you sane for a long run. \n\n2) Forget about research in first year, it is time to explore and ease in otherwise you will just burn out. As for your supervisor, just do minimal as needed and talk to him about the work load you have.\n\n3) Keep dedicated time to unwind: This may seem paradoxical when there is too less time to do stuff but if you want to go far then rest is needed, both physical and mental. I personally find using tech to unwind is not good, it only adds to the mental fatigue.\n\n4) Do not set unrealistic expectations: Your supervisor gives you work to be done in 3 days, you pull an all-nighter and do it in 1 day. He is happy and pats your back. Next time he will expect you to do same amount of work in 2 days as you already did it in 1 day. And the expectations keep on increasing. Not because he is a bad person but because he genuinely thinks you can. he does not know you are over working yourself. This needs to be communicated and he won't even mind it.

I think your faculty and the discipline you're in will very much inform your choice, so definitely ask your supervisor.\n\nThe short answer is: you might not need to write it as a systematic review, but I recommend trying to be systematic in your searches and identifying the seminal papers and authors in the field. This will be able to guide your review and help you make solid arguments.\n\nMy experience is that the method of the review is not always super strict or important, especially at a masters level. I was in Digital Humanities for my MA and was not expected to do a systematic review, however I had to be able to construct a coherent and valid argument so, I did need to be aware of the literature in the field. So for example, I identified three authors that were very important in the field and their work informed my methodology and theoretical framework.\n\nI'm doing a PhD in Library and Information Science now, maybe that perspective helps you out:\n\nWhat is expected in my faculty at this level is to have a methodology for your review, but that doesn't need to be a systematic review. The literature on my topic is too vast and stretches across disciplines and my topic is not sufficiently defined yet for me to be able to do a systematic review. But the expectation is that in doing the review, I will be able to constrain it down to a specific area -&gt; RQ -&gt; method, etc.\n\nThe way I've done it is using a pearl-methodology, after identifying a few seminal papers in my topic that the literature kept coming back to, I looked at their references and collected literature until I got to a point of data saturation. So now I'm at a point where I feel like I have a good grasp of the relevant literature.\n\nI would say that even if your final review is not  systematic and doesn't cover all the literature, you should make sure that your searches and evaluations of the papers have been systematic, so you know why you chose the literature you did and can ensure you're not creating a blindspot for yourself later down the line.\n\nI think there are a range of different kinds of reviews (scoping review, systematic etc) which are chosen according to what you need to get out of it and what the field needs. So the choice in how you present your findings and what you present in the review I'd say is conditioned by your topic, and comes down to what you need to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a few sources for you :)\n\n[https://libraryguides.griffith.edu.au/c.php?g=451351&amp;p=3333115](https://libraryguides.griffith.edu.au/c.php?g=451351&amp;p=3333115)\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/fxye4p/has_anyone_done_a_nonsystematic_review_as_part_of/fmxgmay/"}, "528": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "JessGuurrrl8", "Date": 1586465211, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank you so much, especially the last article was a goldmine.

There are some grants available to those who would like to start up their research career, and some of those too may look at age. I saw several cut off at 40.\n\nDepending on your work experience, your graduate school experience may also differ. If you were the type who immediately took a job after undergrad, you may have already reached middle management at this point with more than five years on the job. Some students who went straight to grad school from undergrad may not have the same management skills as you do. You may find yourself mentoring others when you yourself are craving to receive guidance since you are, after all, a student too.

The PhD itself is a life goal or a means to it, not an alternative to life goals. If you feel that it will distract you from your life goals, then frankly it does not seem to be a priority for you, and you should think twice before starting a program, since you would be committing time, effort and money to it.\n\nI should point out, doing a PhD does not have to mean you will miss out on other life goals. If anything, it can help you get closer to them. Ultimately, it comes down to what you plan on doing after you graduate. The PhD program will take years, but it will eventually end one way or another, and thinking of what you want to do once you finish is crucial. Do you want to work in academia? Then a PhD is very useful (if not required). Do you want to get to work straight away in the private sector? Then a PhD is less useful, and might even be a waste, since a lot of the training you will get comes from the day to day work experience itself. Although you can still work while doing your PhD, so again, depends on your situation and what you are planning to do after graduation. \n\nIn regards to your social life, that\u2019s a mixed bag, and depends on the type of person you are. If you want, the PhD can be a great way to meet a lot of people in your field that you will actively enjoy talking to since they share the same interests and passions, and they won\u2019t look at you weird that you spend hours talking about something that would knock someone else out cold. But it can also be very lonely, where you spend a lot of time away from friends and family to study and work, and it can make you feel isolated and stressed.

Probably because I was a freshly graduated student and didn\u2019t know anything. But he knew my heart was in the right place because I was so focused on learning more)I think You know or not. Academics know if others are or not too. Asking how you can become one as fast as possible is like admitting you are not already \u201can academic\u201d. From my interactions with international scholarship and their scholars, when you sit next to your peers, everybody just knows it\u2019s a way of life already found earlier on, and they are simply working to improve their skills. I know this is not true for everybody but it was for me, so this is the style of advise I would like to give.\n\nWhat are you trying to discover? What is that topic you currently spend all night awake thinking about the problem and solution, and then wake up and try research more? This is the ideal state to be in if you want to maximise efficiency. Nobody can tell you want to do. You get left alone to do it. Doctorates are hard. Not because people cant do the work, oh I have friends much smarter than me quit, because most people don\u2019t know how or what they need to do without having a clear guide. Innovating is real. It\u2019s not for pretend. The exclusive aim of phd is to contribute original, not known, insights to a large group of experts who already know a lot and can review your claims. This is how you get a doctorate. It\u2019s got nothing to do with how smart you are. Of course it takes smarts, but it\u2019s not a iq test. It\u2019s just a specific way of learning not suited to everybody. If you want to know what that feels like, spend a week reading phd dissertations from recent grads from your faculty and see how you can imagine your own dissertation sitting along side them.\n\nAll this aside, your question has pragmatic answers too. First, an honours degree is often required. I think you will find your university will have stipulations on minimal qualifications. What this means for you is, you need to get those as fast as possible. Then you need a research question and understand the general state of the field by way of review. A publication won\u2019t hurt. It is possible to publish at honours, rare, but possible. Anyway your question to too aggressive for me to answer. It\u2019s sort of off mark.

For my PhD, I moved into solution-phase metal nanoparticle synthesis. I got a job in a nanoparticle-related field out of grad school, but when that went under I moved into pharmaceuticals and analytical chemistry. And today, I have moved again into government contracting and consulting, where they explicitly praised my eclectic resume as one of the main deciding factors in why they wanted me for the job. To be fair, that was the first time in my life where anyone in a hiring position had thought it was a positive that I had branched out so much, but my point is that you can get there. It's tougher than sticking to the \"normal\" path early on, but you end up being a much more interesting and desirable candidate for jobs that care about your ability to think creatively rather than simply solve the same kinds of problems over and over again. \n\nAt each step, I brought with me to the new job some of the lessons and mentality of my past experiences, which gave me a different perspective and some unique skills compared to peers who had taken a more traditional career path. It's all about two things: can you make your resume interesting and convincing enough that you can land an interview, and then can you project confidence in your ability to do something new in an interview setting. It gets easier as you get more experienced (\"I've done XYZ before, I won't have trouble learning Q\") but it can be done fresh out of school as well, or shortly afterwards once you get a little work experience in something that is closer related to your degree. \n\nAs for steps you can do to prepare yourself: certainly, self-teaching R, Matlab, and Python will give you a HUGE advantage in some industries over your peers. I taught myself the first two during grad school and undergrad, respectively, and Python is something that I know I'm going to need at some point so I am starting to plan out time to tackle it as well. Online classes are good, having a portfolio of some kind (and, more importantly, some figures you can easily slot into a slide show presentation that show how you've used your programming skills to solve real problems and crunch real data related to your field) is better. Always look for the \"killer figures\" that you're going to be explaining for the rest of your career. Be able to sum up basically any paper or large experiment you do in 1-3 images. \n\nAdditionally, practice interviewing and selling yourself. Take a course on giving your \"elevator pitch\". I did that in my last year of grad school, it was totally worthwhile. **No one** is going to want to invest in you if you don't convince them it's a good idea, and that's 100% your responsibility from now on. Grad school does an awful job, generally, of teaching this (because most professors just want you to stick to academia, where your CV and PI does 90% of the selling for you). Going back to the previous paragraph: images are necessary to sell yourself. You need written words get you in the door, spoken words get them confident and interested in you, and images close the deal by showing better than your words ever could what the company stands to gain by hiring you. Honestly, this advice is good no matter how straight or tangled your career path ends up being, but if you're going non-traditional and shifting your focus out of grad school, it'll be even more important that you're able to sell yourself to people who don't innately know the jargon of your current field, and that means using pretty pictures and explaining why they should care in a way they understand.\n\nSpeaking directly about machine learning: that is an incredibly deep topic that is absolutely brimming with very intelligent, dedicated people. I haven't tried to scratch it yet, because it's one of those situations where either you're going to use an off-the-shelf solution, or you absolutely need the deep knowledge to be able to push the boundaries and develop something more. It'll be much easier for you to use your chemistry degree with a splash of programming to flavor your application, than it'll be for you to actually pursue a real coding job in machine learning (especially if you want something that'll pay you at a level that a chemistry PhD should be paid!). Like, you'll basically need to become an expert in machine learning in order to get a good enough job, which means you'll be competing with people who actually did go to school for it.\n\nI would not recommend that, personally, especially in the Bay Area. The competition for those kinds of jobs sounds insane there, and the talent pool will have much more direct experience than you. Instead, look for something that you can imagine walking up to an interviewer and saying, \"My experience gives me an edge in this field because &lt;reasons&gt;\". If all you can say is that you're smart and you've taken some related classes, but you haven't done any actual work in (say) machine learning, then the best you can hope for is an entry-level undergraduate tier position. You can probably do better than that. Look for companies that are using programming to solve chemistry-related problems, then you'll actually be able to leverage your skills by bringing an expertise that they won't have to go search for elsewhere.\n\nAs a side note, I literally just left the Albany area a few months ago.

As you've seen, in the UK that coursework is taken out of the PhD and put into an actual Masters degree. It is not included in the PhD. You're required to do the Masters.\n\nI know for my program that they don't even accept US students out of a Bachelors degree.

I know that feels impossible for most of us, but when you're determined and you know where you're going, they may act differently than when you turn to them for direction. get a second opinion on anything they're telling you that you need to do for the dissertation and make sure you follow the point above.\n\n\\- limit your time in the lab. usually isolating yourself and working from home is a problem for final stage PhDs, but in your case it could help you get valuable time away from your advisor and this place that creates so much stress for you. \n\n\\- build a physical space that has a structure you like and that motivates you, to make your writing go as well as possible. if you like soft piano music, play that. if you need to take a short break every half hour, do that. if you want to start at 10am or 2pm, do what works for you. some people recommend to treat your PhD like a job, and that can help. even if 9-5 doesn't work for you, you have nothing to \"prove\" so you don't have to work every weekend and holiday, just because that's what people do in your lab. you know you have nothing to lose because you're not staying in academia, so you don't have to follow those unsustainable norms anymore\n\n\\- try, as much as you can, to distance yourself from what your advisor says about your work. my partner heard the same things you mentioned: that he didn't work hard enough, that he must have made a mistake when the study didn't return the \"right\" result, and that he didn't have the skill to do research (despite being very successful in all other labs). its natural to take these comments as a reflection of who we are as a person. we all pour so much into our work, that we get wrapped up in it. but you have to separate yourself from your academic work either way, so remember you are way more than this.\n\n\\- find a pen pal or dissertation buddy to keep you on track with your writing. I'm happy to be that for you if you want, as I have about a year to analyze and write my dissertation. Feel free to PM me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.

I made a list of pros and cons (that looks exactly like yours), and eventually settled on finishing the PhD as long as my needs were met, and as long as it's being done as quickly as possible.

No...but I am at least able to work albeit slowly on finishing what I started when I really really don't want to be doing that.\n\nMy main motivator right now is the little bit extra money that we could get as PhD holders, and the fact that I am close to graduating. I would consider quitting again if my mental health got worse and/or if it were to take more than a year to finish it. So I guess I know how you feel in the sense that I keep asking others around me the same question on a weekly basis, hoping someone will tell me it makes sense to quit, validates my feelings and encourages me to get the fuck out of this mess.

With all due respect but it sounds like you\u2019ve got no idea what labs you are applying for and are gunning for these schools simply because they\u2019re Ivy League. I get it, it\u2019d be awesome to get admitted and getting the prestige of having a PhD from such a place but even with really high scores and excellent references the admissions process is an uphill battle and you will need to show how you\u2019re a unique applicant that\u2019s not only smart but will actually bring something to the research group. \n\nThree random thoughts/tips for preparing for admissions:\n\n1. During the interviews you need to demonstrate that you have genuine interest in the research they\u2019re doing. Your best shot at getting admitted is being strong in the research fields your prospective lab works in (in my experience). If you still can, it could be worthwhile trying to set up projects/publications to demonstrate your ability in these fields if you haven\u2019t already. I doubt that just stating your interests and having good grades is going to cut it. \n\n2. Sounds silly but when stating your research interests you have to be SUPER clear and specific. I think it won\u2019t work to be just interested in algo, you need to be able to explain which field within algorithmics it is you like (since that\u2019s what will link you with your supervisor). In my case, I did not just state I was interested in Bayesian statistics (already quite niche) but specifically in uncertainty quantification and the problems that come with scaling. If you say you\u2019re interested in any field, you\u2019ll usually be expected to be up to speed with recent developments to perform well af interview. \n\n3. It massively helps if you\u2019ve singled out individuals in the places you are applying to you\u2019d like to work with or whose research appeals to you. If you can\u2019t find such a person or such a lab it is likely you won\u2019t find a project that suits you (and then a PhD can really suck). If you find such people, write them an email! Not all will respond (most won\u2019t) but if they do, they\u2019ll give you info about which labs are taking people and other useful info. This helps you narrow down where to apply. \n\n\nPersonal anecdote: while researching PhDs I absolutely loved one of the groups and wrote the head an email. Got a response and we Skyped informally before I even submitted an application. I knew I wanted to work with her and also knew for certain that I was willing to put in the time and effort in the project. When I was interviewed later I was hyper aware of the research and could clearly explain what I wanted to do and why.

Whereas, if the same work would be submitted by an unknown PI's lab, it would be sure to get an editorial rejection. The problem is me, and many like me, got into research with a very idealistic view of science. I feel everything that you (OP) have  said - that my love for learning and finding how and why things work have vanished somewhere. There's a paper published in Nature - that negative results are important too, and should be published. But how often do we see that? Even my PIs have told me - that it's a very idealistic thing, and quite far from reality. How many negative results has Nature published in the last year? I have had team members of my lab develop simple computational models which are more  effective than deep learning ones, but their work keeps getting rejected, because it's simple.

Each Sunday I\u2019m doing a wrap-up of what I have accomplished, where is my project now and what are the next steps. Recently I\u2019ve started with adding 2-3 specific goals for the week, but it\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019m just having a log in my iPhone which is simple. Max up to 5 sentences. Sometimes, when I feel sticker, I\u2019m writing why I think that to identify the problem. It might seems stupid, but this Sunday routine, speaking for me, generate a really massive amount of productivity and I also feel more self-confident about what I\u2019m doing. \n\n2. I\u2019m using daily diary (planner?) to write there blocks of what I\u2019m going to do. I like Moleskine, but any other with written hours will do the job. It\u2019s being useful, when I know there is some zoom etc. so I could plan in advance what to do. I also use electronic calendar, but only for the zoom, classes etc. In the analog one, I\u2019m just marking that for example from 8 to 10:30 I want to be working on framework, 10:45 zoom, etc. I think it\u2019s better to plan each following day at the end of the previous day so in the morning I know exactly what to do.

Tracking! I\u2019m keeping log. I have an excel sheet to which I\u2019m at the end of the day writing just in one sentence what I was doing.

There is no magic and something that work sometimes don't work ever.\n\nJudging by using the concept of productivity is a sign that shoud alert you about the meaning of what you do. Productivity is a matter of performance. Producing knowledge is not a matter of performance. If it is, you can judge when the work is done (results), not during the process of doing it.\n\nProductivity is not something innate. It is a question a quantity/time. It depends both on your objectives and your feelings when you judge what you\u2019ve done. When I feel bad after too much procrastination, I try to readjust both and stop measuring things that can't (and maybe shouldn't) be. \n\nProcrastination is a self-sustaining process. The more you procrastinate, the more you feel like a procrastinator, the more you procrastinate, the more your judgment is negative. Stop to depreciate yourself for being a procrastinator. We are all. What to do ?\u00a0Find your way to deal with it, and it begins by accepting that it is something \"normal\" and not necessarily bad (it's like being bored : it's total and self-contained and it make you feel that you can't escape from it. But it is something we need to try new things, have ideas, and think about what we really want to do).\n\nSometimes, it is too much so we have to stop it.

Find something you like to do and give you free time to do it. Even things that seem unproductive can boost your productivity (sport, sleep, cooking, playing -&gt; you can find pseudo-productivity-criteria for all of them). Do something that give you quick gratification. Research is a long way dealing with uncertainty and we need satisfaction as well. You can't be \"productive\" if you don't give you strenght to deal with uncertainty and difficult tasks. You can't be \"productive\" everytime in everything.\n\n* give you small and reachable objectives, try pomodoro method. It's always better to work a few hours a day making small but true steps than working for a long time doing nothing. Productivity depends on your time scale. You can feel very productive by reaching small goals in a day. You'll don't make a lot of progress, but you\u2019ll be productive. \n\n* when you touch bottom, take a break. You say that you \"work\" a lot and don't do anything : stop looking the fact that you don't do anything but look at how much you try/want to work. If you are not productive, it's not that you\u2019re a bad person, it's just that you\u2019re out of your best productivity. Give you a few day to do things you want to, to rest, to breath, to think and ramble.\nDo what you can before thinking of what you should have done.\n\n* avoid staying up late to finish.

Understanding yourself, and exactly why you feel the way you do, is necessary to be able to address your anxieties effectively. \n\nI\u2019ll use my current experience as an example. I have also been finding it impossible to focus or make effective progress, and I recently realised that is due to a paralysing anxiety too. Before that, I had been misattributing my inability to focus directly onto a personal issue I\u2019m dealing with. I realised that actually, the personal issue has no tangible reason to affect my work, so there must be something in my mind linking the two problems - that\u2019s the anxiety. Then, I thought about *why* I feel anxious. It\u2019s because I\u2019m terrified of losing the chance at the life that my PhD paves the way to because of this personal issue - and that fear is partly inflated by my previous life experience. (I was bullied during school and never felt as though I \u2018belonged\u2019 anywhere before my postgrad studies. So the sense of belonging I\u2019ve found in the research community feels extra valuable, and it feels like I have a lot to lose - hence the anxiety about failing.) Until now, I had been trying to address the personal issue directly, but that wasn\u2019t improving my ability to work and focus. Now I realise that the personal issue and my work can coexist, if I take some time to work through the fear, and understand that my difficulty in focussing is unrelated to many things that I had assumed it was related to. So don\u2019t be afraid to delve into your past etc. to figure out *why* you feel the way you do. You need to know that, in order to remedy it. \n\nI also have some thoughts about your meeting-specific anxiety. I get what you mean about not feeling pressure to work without meetings, but working on something just to feed it back feels like false progress in some ways. If you feel able to, I would strongly suggest speaking to your advisor about that. It may be that your working style doesn\u2019t suit these meetings, and that you\u2019d make more progress on your own terms, or with a different kind of meeting. At the end of the day, meetings and deadlines are external motivators - they\u2019re useful in some ways, but ultimately, you are the only person who is accountable for your PhD. So the meetings certainly shouldn\u2019t be a cause of anxiety, but they also shouldn\u2019t be your only source of motivation - and if they are, something needs to change (the format or periodicity of the meeting, for example). Again, something your advisor may be able to help with.\n\nI also agree with the suggestion of taking some time out to do what you enjoy!

I was always incredibly tired during the day and would constantly take naps. \n\nI went to the doctors because I figured I was missing something in my diet, maybe I had some physical illness. The doctor unceremoniously and pretty gruffly said \u201cyou\u2019ve got depression\u201d. I thought it was bullshit. It took me months to go to the therapist. \n\nWhen I went to the therapist she asked what I thought of all this and therapy in general. I told her I thought it was all bullshit and useless and I wasn\u2019t depressed. She started off with her normal questioning about having negative thoughts about myself or about others. I told her no, I don\u2019t have any of those thoughts, I\u2019m not sad, I\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m just unmotivated, a bit lazy, and really tired. \n\nShe told me I have [Dysthymia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20350929). I never had any problems with emotions or happiness, I was still happy and upbeat. It turns out that all the years of thinking I was lazy or had sleeping problems were from my lack of time-management and underlying stress. \n\nI\u2019d always wait until the last minute to do work, I\u2019d stay up late to get things done (thinking I worked better under pressure which is complete bullshit, now that I\u2019ve tried actually working normally), I\u2019d read things over and over and never retain it, and I\u2019d nap constantly. \n\nWhat I learned from my therapist and [this workbook](https://www.talkplus.org.uk/downloads_folder/Behavioural_Activation.pdf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) is that by procrastinating and ignoring things I was just adding more and more stress and anxiety to my subconscious and that was making me physically tired and causing me so much stress that I couldn\u2019t cope and I\u2019d just fall asleep. \n\nI\u2019d also \u2018work\u2019 for 12 hours a day and that\u2019s one of the problems. You have to set reasonable goals for yourself and balance life. The two most important things I learned were SMART Goals and the Three Legged Stool. \n\nSMART Goals are simple (and redundant):\n\nSpecific\nMeasurable\nAchievable \nRealistic/Relevant\nTime-specific. \n\nBasically, make very clear and specific goals that you can identify have been achieved in the time that you wanted and at the time you wanted. So instead of saying \u201cI want to work on Chapter 3 today\u201d say \u201cat 9am I want to work for 3 hours and write 500 words on the introduction, with citations, figures, etc.\u201d \n\nIt sounds like a massive pain and overly anal but it\u2019s a great tool to use and make yourself feel successful for completing goals. It also takes mountains and turns them into hills. It\u2019s the same for everything in life, which is the point of the Three Legged Stool. \n\nTwo good examples from General life are clothes and dishes. If you procrastinate doing the laundry or washing the dishes you\u2019re adding underlying stress to your life. Constantly see the pile of clothes will remind you that you need to do laundry. Then when it comes to it you have a massive pile to deal with. It\u2019ll also add stress and anxiety when you actually need a specific shirt or piece of clothing that you\u2019ve been putting off washing. \n\nIf you break it down though and do it bit by bit you will get rid of the pile and then have no pile ever, if you keep up with it. This is part of the balance of life of the Three Legged Stool. Essentially, you can\u2019t sit on a stool where one leg is too long or too short. They all need to be equal lengths. \n\nThe \u2018working\u2019 for 12 hours a day was a form of subconscious punishment for me. I didn\u2019t complete my work so now I can\u2019t do the things I want to or the things I need to, which would stress me out, I\u2019d end up watching YouTube videos for hours, then I\u2019d nap, and get the work don\u2019t at 4 in the morning. \n\nWhen I was told I was punishing myself I also thought that was bullshit. But then I started applying the same SMART goals to the rest of my life, setting out time for relaxing, exercise, relationships, etc. and it turned my life around. \n\nI went from eating shitty food, doing nothing while \u2018working\u2019 all day, being miserable and tired all the time, working until 3 or 4 am with a terrible sleep schedule to  going to bed every night at 11, getting up at 6 am, exercising every day, getting all my work done on time (and to a higher standard), and getting back to the things I enjoyed. \n\nI hope this helps! And don\u2019t be caught up in the stigma. It still bothers me and I still won\u2019t tell people I was/am \u2018depressed\u2019 (aside from anonymously on reddit) because they immediately jump to the stereotypical sad, suicidal, and miserable type of depression. My girlfriend even cried when I told her because she thought I was miserable... I wasn\u2019t. I was just terrible at time-management.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso don\u2019t feel bad about not having published. I\u2019m in the middle of my second year and still haven\u2019t published. It bugs the hell out of me but I know the type of work I\u2019m doing doesn\u2019t quite fit into most journals so I just have to bide my time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/g1z2xs/struggling_to_focus/fnkrtsw/"}, "1209": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "master_and_mojito", "Date": 1587038253, "Score": 4, "Body": "I got asked why my conclusions were so sad and depressive.

A lot of PhD programs here have competitive funding. In the best case, competitive funding just means the competition for funding packages is part of admission and you could be offered an unfunded place. In the worst, it means they change who gets funding each year according to some rubric (usually based on class performance), they have more students than they can support, and competition for funding can get intense. If who gets funding changes each year, you can wind up wasting a lot of time focusing on things that affect funding but don't mean anything for your CV (like getting straight As). It also makes you more vulnerable to funding cuts, which I'd be concerned about given the impending economic fallout from Covid-19 closures. The best way to look into funding do this is to (tactfully) ask students at the school what the funding situation is. Most professors will be straight with you about it, but enough will make competitive funding seem easy to get even if it's really not at all that I would trust the students more.\n\nTo my knowledge, usually it's harder to get a non-US PhD and get a job in the US, but it can be  field dependent (and can even be university-dependent) so I'd ask people in your area of study. I only applied to US programs even though there are awesome programs at UK institutions because both the domestic and the international job markets in my field seem to really favor US PhDs. On the other hand, two of the younger professors in my department in the US have UK PhDs, so it's not a total bar.\n\nMany US universities do look for some university-level teaching experience when hiring so the lack of TA or teaching duties at some UK universities would hinder you if you want to job hunt in the US.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/g27vco/crosspostish_from_rgradadmissions_advice_on_uk_vs/fnkw4ox/"}, "1219": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1587043106, "Score": 29, "Body": "Probably some ignorrant HR person don't read too much into it.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/g2el1a/potential_employer_wants_a_phd_but_in_the_job/fnkygsg/"}, "1220": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Desolate_puppy", "Date": 1587043574, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thanks!

Here we have a systematic problem that I don't think is properly addressed by universities or healthcare in general. Maybe PhD-experience related depression/anxiety is a special flavour of bad that needs more than traditional approaches to fix. Adding personal-life challenges into the mix makes it even more complicated.\n\n Congrats on paper 1. Making revisions is still a lot of progress! With potentially two more coming, it sounds like you're doing pretty great even if it's soul crushing. For me, there's a lot of slow periods and then really fast and productive ones so perhaps you're stuck in a slow one right now. Considering that this is a  pandemic, Covid can definitely alter timelines like that. Can you seek help on the proteomics analysis? Maybe outside of your supervisor if that's more of a dead-end? Is your DRC helpful at all? Professors that aren't teaching right now might even be inclined to help brainstorm with you if you're still in early stages with that paper. \n\nGoodluck!

I tried to always remind myself during the phd that people have unproductive periods for weeks or even months at a time - and not everyone is totally transparent why that is. For me, sometimes I needed productive procrastination to get my mind stimulated again while still having some form of professional development. Sometimes my fear was just too big and I needed to do absolute minimal work (only reply to emails, read light articles) and instead focus on my mental and physical health.\n\nI always described a phd as a cross between being an artist and owning your own business. It feels so personal so we put so much pressure on ourselves. But we can't just clock in and out for a 7 hour shift when we have to. We don't have those same external expectations, and we dont have those short term goals. As long as you still deliver for those important deadlines, then things aren't going totally different than a lot of phd students.\n\nWhen I was able to switch off the endless phd guilt I let myself enjoy some of those unproductive days by enjoying that I wasn't in the 9 to 5 grind and do other things instead.

You might be right, but you're not helping yourself or making yourself look good.

Both of these things, although difficult to deal with, are fairly normal for someone just graduated in the UK. If you can afford to self fund, could you not afford to look for a bit longer? I not saying you should never self fund, but it seems a strange decision in your situation.\n\nIn your TLDR you say your supervisor has 'has no scientific background' - what do you mean by this? No formal \nacademic background and has come from industry? Otherwise, how can they be supervising students in science phds? \n\nIt also sounds like you're pinning a lot of hopes on this PhD. You're hoping it will make you less depressed, mean you can maintain a long term relationship etc. I'm not sure this is realistic. \n\nThe reason there is no project proposal could be that your supervisor hasn't applied for funding.

I would definitely check Glassdoor and see if they are either low balling you or if that\u2019s just what that company offers, sometimes they only have the budget to give you so much. Either way, I would ask for a counteroffer, something along the lines of \u201cthe median starting salary for someone of my experience and my field is a bit higher than the offer, so I was looking to see if you would be able to offer $x.xx\u201d. \n\nI would also look into what the signing bonuses and other benefits are!! These you can also negotiate if it turns out that they can\u2019t negotiate salary for some reason. \n\nI hope this helps! I recently navigated through the job market, as well as a lot of my close friends! so if you have any more questions definitely DM me! I am in polymer chemistry, but I\u2019m sure the fields are relatively close enough where we can gauge what you should be getting and how to go about it!!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/g7gc8i/chemistry_phd_starting_salary_of_60000_reasonable/fohlrug/"}, "2063": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AnswerMyQuestionssss", "Date": 1587768102, "Score": 3, "Body": "I\u2019m US citizen, so no.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/g7gc8i/chemistry_phd_starting_salary_of_60000_reasonable/fohlt9q/"}, "2064": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AnswerMyQuestionssss", "Date": 1587768132, "Score": -5, "Body": "Post docs also get great benefits compared to industry.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/g7gc8i/chemistry_phd_starting_salary_of_60000_reasonable/fohlvqz/"}, "2065": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "andrew314159", "Date": 1587768288, "Score": 4, "Body": "Ok that\u2019s fair, it should be less than or equal to.

Since you mentioned corporate consulting, I guess this would a PhD related to business (I'm in Marketing, by the way). \n\nA few things that might help:\n\n\"I do love learning\" - Learning is quite different if you follow the PhD route. So, you'd better be sure that you love the specific kind of learning we do. Usually, learning is about acquiring knowledge. But, for us, the goal is to develop and discover new knowledge, so the important thing is not acquiring knowledge. This can really change things a LOT. People who are very good at acquiring existing knowledge can be very bad at discovering new knowledge.\n\n\"I love challenging theory/concepts\" - This really depends a lot on the kind of research you want to do. But remember that \"challenging\" at PhD level can easily mean \"absolutely f\\* difficult, something that the top minds of the world can take their whole lives to understand\". We see researchers from places like Harvard or MIT struggling hard, and being trashed. Even the \"not-so-challenging\" theories and concepts can be very, very difficult. My research so far is \"simple,\" but still amazingly hard to do. That love for challenging theories and concepts can easily disappear. Often, we focus on what is doable, not on what is challenging. Because the doable already pushes us to our limits. Also, even if you love challenging theories and concepts, that does not mean you will love the work that is necessary to do research about them. You can have a lot of boring but arduous work behind an interesting topic. \n\n\"I love writing\" - Again, you gotta be sure you're talking about the kind of writing we do. Really, how much do we write? Depending on the field, you are not even expected to have one paper published by the time you graduate. Of course I write, but it's not something that I really do that much. I think I used to write more before I started a PhD. I actually miss writing nowadays, because I rarely have the opportunity to do much writing. It's a lot of work until I get to the point I'm really ready to write. And, then, the writing goes quickly, and I go back to the other stuff again. \n\nI don't know exactly what you mean by pride, lifestyle, or recognition. \n\nPride is a very personal thing, so maybe you're right. I'm proud of what I do, but I never use it as a relevant motivation. \n\nLifestyle has pros and cons, it depends on what you want for your life really. I left a corporate career, but I knew I didn't want that for me anymore after decades of work. \n\nAnd I don't think recognition is a thing really for PhD. Most people don't understand what a PhD really is, so they cant' really recognize you for something they don't understand. And most people who do understand also have a PhD, so it's not something that impressive for them. They will expect much more than a degree to recognize you.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/g7daxx/cant_shake_wanting_to_do_a_phd/fohp6i8/"}, "2073": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "yahatetoseeit1212", "Date": 1587771241, "Score": 1, "Body": "I vaguely remember reading something about how Vitamin D can affect sleep quality.

Today, we are so rushed to churn out papers so we can get a decent post-doc and get our advisors tenure and promotions that the science lacks refinement. We need to do way more work than our advisors ever had to do to publish in the same journal. There are also fewer unknowns and the obvious discoveries have for the most part been found.

Ah no, in my experience, PhD graduates have earned their degrees and are capable scientists. \n\nAs another person said, I think it's the publish or perish mentality. Also sorry for the scrawl, just woke up and thought this was an interesting topic. Some points below:\n\nAs a PhD student at the end of their program who has published, I regularly get requests to review, I also find myself leaning towards reject as well. I think it was because in my own process of getting published, the comments I received were so nit-picky, to a point where I felt like what was deemed \"major revisions\" for the most part were a squillion minor revisions, any manuscripts that I think need major revisions is usually a reject. I'm talking about things like redoing data analysis.\n\nAnd then the flip side: I also feel like the review process is so subjective. As someone who is submitting manuscripts, sometimes comments come back on rejected papers and I genuinely wonder if it's worth revising the manuscript (yet again) to have the next reviewer point out something else, sometimes even the same change and advised it be reversed. I also do revise because I want to keep on my supervisors' good side, but as someone going out into the wild soon, I'm not sure I'll bother. Is it lazy? Yes.\n\nAs an aside, there's also these inane, and sometimes frankly frustrating, barriers to publishing which make the process really annoying like journal-specific referencing styles and templates. Word counts have a place, but they primarily used to be so strict for physical publishing reasons, e.g. to limit the cost of printing. I feel like if word counts were more flexible in journals, we would get a richer understanding of the processes involved in the work, from background lit to deeper discussion points.\n\nAnd to your thought on quality - some of the older research we have in the field is just garbage. My systematic review was recently published, and included papers from the 90's. These were the most difficult to integrate into the synthesis because they left out key information that are almost required to be reported today in human research (participant demographics being a big one).  From what I've found, from a rigor stand-point, older manuscripts are not of better quality than newer work.

My entire phd motive was focused around not only  knowing the state of art research on this topic, but contributing to what had given me so much along the way. Of course, tech is bigger than ever, and not surprisingly, tech is moving towards these questions in more impactful ways. In any case, my motive was to understand how humans make sense with one another and produce social order within the contextual settings we find ourselves. This line of social enquiry is called Ethnomethodology, for those wondering. My thesis is a unique contribution to this discipline in the form of a few case studies that describes the sequential relationship between social acts. My hope post phd is to use this knowledge, and the lessons from this field, to,return to the tech space and design and innovate more meaningful digital products.

They apply rigor because they want to ensure that you can succeed and fulfil the objectives you\u2019ve set for yourself.\n\n- You know your topic best and the decisions you\u2019ve made so far. It helps to be clear about how your purpose, aims, approach, methods are tied together. This helps to anchor your argument, and be consistent in your theoretical position.\n\n- Presentation requirements might vary for different programs, but a well-designed deck of slides can really take the load off presentation stress. I had someone who was adept at communication design to help me with my slides. It really made them more concise and clear, and that gave me confidence in my delivery. I wasn\u2019t just reading off bullet points.\n\n- If you do run into an examiner who seems overly critical, do take a breath before responding. It\u2019ll help you discern if the criticism is reasonable, constructive and a learning point. Sometimes it may just be a different perspective or paradigm that they are using. I had one examiner who was very detailed in his comments, but I was told later by my supervisors that I needn\u2019t consider his points at all.\n\n- Are you doing your defense online, or in person?

As for programs, what I did was contact these professors, introduce myself/give a brief breakdown of my background, express my interest in their lab, and asked what programs they though best suited my interest/background.\n\nFrom there I just made a google sheet of programs I was interested in then narrowed it down to 10 schools that I applied to. \n\n2)I\u2019m poor, I don\u2019t have money to be traveling to campuses to tour before applying. \n\nThis not a worry at least for STEM PhD's I am unsure about social science. One, most applications have a fee waiver for low income student. Two, no need to visit because once you get interviews to prospective programs, they will fly you out to visit all expenses paid. I'd focus on building your profile so you get these interviews in the first place \n\nHope this helps, and if you PM me your gmail I can share this resource to you.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gab7rj/making_a_resource_for_people_interested_in_going/fozb226/"}, "2560": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "hopeful20000000", "Date": 1588188082, "Score": 1, "Body": "Has to be psychology", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ga0xxa/why_did_you_do_a_phd/fozbxcw/"}, "2561": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jane_santos", "Date": 1588188147, "Score": 1, "Body": "I hope you will find a way to prioritize your mental and physical healths over job!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gaeghg/bad_mental_health_day/fozc28f/"}, "2562": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "shaybee377", "Date": 1588188211, "Score": 2, "Body": "Not going to lie, it is hard sometimes!

I just talked to a couple of professors I liked from my undergrad studies to see if they had any funding available for another PhD student in their lab. The professor I ended up studying under pretty much told me he should have funding for the next semester when I would enroll and showed me a desk spot in his lab that I could sit at during our first meeting. Also, my best friend from undergrad was working under this professor, so I knew people in the lab and how he operated. I've heard the horror stories of working under bad advisors, in terms of never being available or being overly demanding, but my advisor is a guy who built his lab on mutual respect. He treated us like professionals, was available pretty much any time, and just expected you to do your work and keep him updated on your progress. It's very much similar to my experience working in industry. My first boss was actually a guy who graduated from the same research group around the time I started.\n\nSo I started doing work in his lab the summer before I started grad school, got my funding, and earned my PhD. It wasn't always easy, I struggled a lot and felt like quitting on multiple occasions, but I had an extremely supportive advisor who was available to talk about whatever and encouraged me to push through.\n\nI know people don't typically recommend studying at the same University for all your degrees, but for me, I wasn't really looking for academic prestige. I knew the professor I worked under was well connected in a particular industry that could help me find a job when I finished. It isn't anything super exciting, not really an industry I had any interest in before my grad work, but it's the community that I'm a part of now, and I entered the industry pretty well connected as a new PhD graduate thanks to my advisor.\n\nI guess I'm a success story, but everyone has their own path and goals for what they want. I'm doing the kind of work I always wanted to when I first got my chemical engineering degree, it just took a while to get here. I might have wished to be in a more interesting/\"exciting\" industry when I was younger, but I guess every industry needs \"experts\".", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ga0xxa/why_did_you_do_a_phd/fozf5y1/"}, "2564": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "no1kobefan", "Date": 1588192082, "Score": 1, "Body": "I'm in the humanities.
