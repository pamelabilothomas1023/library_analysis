You don't want vague or general answers so that might be a good idea to be more precise :)\n\nI'm doing a dissertation in computational linguistics so my \"theory as thread\" thingy was two-fold. First of all, there was the real linguistics part in which I described the main theories, then adapted the theories into the existing computational paradigms. That is to say, for example, that in natural language processing, there are two main paradigms and that in one of them, linguistics are in no use at all -- the machine doesn't know grammar, doesn't car whether we're dealing with nouns, verbs, etc. This was my main \"point\" so I tried to weave that into my research question. When I described my research question(s), and the methods that I'll have to use, the theoretical background was that I'd have to be dealing with those facts.

Ok, let me tackle Fairness first, oh there are all these fairness measures and I keep getting different fairness results depending on the randomness of the environment.
