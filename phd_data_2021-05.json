Find a productivity app that actually makes you feel motivated and rewarded for working towards your goals.\n\nI read the book The Professor is In, which offers thorough and practical advice for preparing for an academic career.\n\nI kept in touch with friends who are supportive...even talking over zoom is helpful for relieving the stress and isolation. Having even one good friend I could talk to was key in keeping myself mentally healthy.\n\nI let myself enjoy some other hobbies unrelated to my dissertation.

Anything could have been happening to me during those years and there were no external safeguards to ensure I was doing fine.\n\nWe have check-ins every 8 weeks, where we can write a report on how we feel about our own progress. If needed, we can check a box indicating that we need help and an independent group will immediately be put together to investigate. We were actually warned about that box by the department because someone ticked it accidentally (\"help\" is a rather vague term), and there was a massive reaction from the university to make sure the student was alright. We also all have 2 supervisors, 1 being the main supervisor and the other being a person outside of our area of expertise. And we all have personal tutors who are not a member of the department, who are assigned specifically to help with pastoral care.\n\n&gt;My work during my undergrad was much better than my postgrad for the reason that I felt less pressure to perform well.\n\nI had the **exact** opposite! Undergrad was a huge deal. As an international student coming from poverty, doing well in university was my only way out. 4 years of intense work to make sure I got nothing less than a perfect GPA, plus all the research work, publishing, going to conferences, and part-time work (for money) on the side. It was the minimum needed to have a chance at the PhD here. Now I'm here, there is no chance of being fired. I already passed my upgrade and no one in living memory has failed their dissertation, so the PhD is all but guaranteed if I put in a pretty mediocre effort. \n\nSo yes, I agree that there are bad experiences in a PhD. I believe everything you've said about your own experiences. At the same time, there's hard evidence that we can make a much better experience within the system we have. There is a lot of variation across the UK that we can make the most of, to show us what works and what doesn't. It's a bit more admin to be doing all these checks, but it's possible and they really make a difference. Part of the reason why we don't make change is precisely because there's too much variation. Someone at my university or any other like it isn't going to be fighting your cause that much, because it's just not our reality and not our university. We can't bind PhD candidates together under a union when 99% of what that union does/fights for won't apply to an individual.

And to label you as stupid amidst these demanding factors? That's unacceptable. And yes, unsustainable. \n\nRespectfully though, i think that your definition of resilience, as with the other comment, is a bit off base.\n\nResilience is *not* the ability to 'cope no matter what and maintain my performance standards and carry the load being placed on my shoulders and persevering/holding strong when I'm already stretched way beyond my capacity to cope'. \n\nThat's not resilience. That's a system straining to cope in survival mode. And it sounds like you've been maintaining a survival state for a while. You must be exhausted. I genuinely send good will your way and hope you can get/are getting periods of restoration and down time so your tank can be topped up.\n\nThat's just...wow. Yes, unsustainable. \n\nAnd sadly, I'm sure some people may have observed that you were/are 'so resilient'. \n\nBut resilience in its truest sense is about what happens AFTER experiencing a situation that exceeded one's ability to cope. When something WAS too much, whether on a minor scale (crushing email) or a major scale (12 months of data and work has proved pointless). \n\nResilience comes from the French *resilir* , meaning re- (back), and movement (jump, or leap). Similar to re-coil...just without the nuance of disgust or fear. It's when someone encounters something difficult or painful, and after experiencing the adversity or trauma, can process it and take the time they need and return to their state of function. Can continue. They have not had their world ended. \n\nEven if it felt that it *had* ended for a bit there. Maybe for quite a while. \n\nIt's the psychological equivalent of a toddler stumbling, grazing their knee, crying, then eventually getting back up to a little toddler squat and slowly starting to toddler again (whether someone kissed it better or not, or they had a lie down for a bit because it was just too much...). Then it happens again. And so they do it again. In a healthy state, this is learning that the bump on the knee derailed us...but only for a bit.\n\nI don't mean that example to be patronising to anyone. It's a metaphor. The original quote mentioned that PhDs facilitate resilience in the face of pressure and criticism. Because they are regular features of a phd. And it's hard. They hurt.

You won't pay income tax at all for this wage or you will minimally pay (around 3%) so this is approximately what you get in your pocket. University fee is around 500 euros per annum. For comparison, minimum wage is around 1100 euros and median wage  is 1800 euros net. Starting salaries for engineers are more in the 2000+ range. For purchasing power, il greatly depends on the city you live in. Paris is extremely expensive and it would be tight to live on that salary unless you live in a shared apartment or manage to find a cheap accommodation (not an easy task). In medium or small cities, you can live relatively comfortably (I think less than 1600 euros in fairly big cities would be tight though). \n\n2. Depends on the lab. Legally, you have 9 or 10 weeks of paid vacation. However, nobody takes them in full otherwise work won't be done. My personal experience that may not apply in other labs is that hours are  very flexible (easy to take vacation time even with short notice, i choose my own hours, if I have an appointment no need to get an authorization, etc.). However, programs last 3 years and you may have a lot of work during the last year to finish everything.

As a passion project. This is often how people view their PhD, or think about PhDs in general. **And many times, especially in the states, this is the only option**. If funding is lacking, the work environment sucks and the work is crazy difficult, the only way anyone will successfully complete that is if it's a passion project. \n\n2. As a job. I live/work in Europe, and this is how I and many of my fellow PhDs treat our work. I get a regular salary, have vacation days, have a union, etc. Overall, I have the **luxury** of being able to treat this like a job. This means that I don't need some special love for my work in order to complete it, and I don't have love for it. I don't dislike my work, but it's not the best thing ever to me.\n\nThis is to say, it is entirely possible to do a PhD without the crazy amount of passion needed to ignore a lot of suffering. **Under the right conditions, it can just be a regular, albeit low paying, job**.\n\n&gt; Unlike other people I don't have one topic or 2-3 very specific topics I'm very passionate about which makes be wonder whether I should pursue a PhD in the first place\n\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many PhD offers are project specific, so you'll be hired to do research in a particular area. This is often tied to funding, so it's pretty inflexible. If someone is looking for a PhD in a specific topic, they'll find it hard to find a PhD offer that suits their needs. Someone more flexible to different topics might have a better chance here.\n\n&gt; Also most institutes require 3 LORs in a PhD Application but I would most likely have only 1 from the prof I did my long term internship with. Will I be able to apply?? I don't even have a research publication in my name.\n\nAgain, I'm in NL, so it's a little different. But I only had one solid LOR, and I had one \"single use\" LOR (I could reasonably ask that professor to send a single letter of rec, but probably not more). My PhD offer didn't ask for any LORs. I asked my supervisor about it, and she said she wanted the candidate to be able to speak for themselves, not to rely on others to speak for them. \n\nI've seen varying numbers of LORs from 0 (mine) to 3. It should be possible to find offers that only want one LOR. Admittedly, I did not consider going back to the states for a PhD. I wanted a stable salary and vacation days, and I didn't think finding those in the US was likely.\n\nAs for the research, I had no published papers when I applied. The one thing my now supervisor did want to see was evidence that I knew how to write. I submitted a seminar paper I wrote during my masters. That was sufficient.\n\n&gt; Also, I don't like academia. I'm not very inclined towards teaching. Instead, I want to work in the industry and make something innovative with my knowledge. I don't like theoretical stuff alot, I want to make use of the things we learn in the class.\n\nSo? Many PhDs don't end up in academia. Especially STEM PhD, our earning potential is significant higher in industry. I have a friend working in biotech, and his biggest complaint is that he's basically hit a ceiling in his career since he only has a BS. And there are PhDs younger and less experienced than him who are getting promoted over him simply because they have a PhD and he doesn't.\n\nSome areas in some fields are really focused on the degree, and depending on what you want to do, getting a PhD would be useful. The common advice is to think about what you want to do, and figure out if you need to get a PhD to get there. If you don't, then maybe don't do one. It's a lot of work, and if you don't need it, it might not be worth it.\n\n&gt; Should I go directly for a PhD after my Masters? Not sure If I'll be able to get one.\n\n&gt; Should I work a few years before I enter a PhD?\n\nThese are the same question. And no one can answer this for you.\n\nMy advice is that if you need/want a PhD, you should work toward getting one. That means apply for them. Worse case scenario, you get rejected and you keep trying. Even if you get accepted, figure out if you have the passion for the project or if you have the support necessary to be able to treat it like a regular job.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n32ht4/im_really_confused_whether_i_should_pursue_a_phd/gwr72a4/"}, "230": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "klbm9999", "Date": 1620025016, "Score": 31, "Body": "I feel sad for people joining phd in 2220", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n3fyru/although_of_course_i_still_do_challenge_people_to/gwr7gh7/"}, "231": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Playful-Influence894", "Date": 1620025827, "Score": 1, "Body": "It would largely depend on the field.

Should I include all three? Should I try to combine them all into one somehow? Should I only include the most recent (and longest)? Do I include mundane things like being a grader (I'm guessing no). \n\nThis is a valid work experience. However, you need to outline the important parts. For instance, did you manage or at least collaborate with other RAs (which shows leadership or collaboration skills), what is the outcome of your research and which skills have you acquired as a result, and etc. In general, be succinct and focus on important outcomes and numbers. Any work experience can be relevant as long as it is presented correctly.\n\n&gt;Do I include fellowships I have received during my PhD and that sort of thing?

It doesn't hurt to put these somewhere at the bottom, but if you don't have enough space, then you can exclude them. \n\n&gt; Do I have different sections for academic work (research assistant, teaching, research consulting, etc.) vs. professional experience (like internships I did in college).\n\nThis should be in the same section called work experience.\n\n&gt; Do you exclude experiences that aren't all that relevant to the job you're applying for but perhaps show you're a go getter and have done lots of things to professionally develop yourself? \n\nIn general, you should include the most relevant experience, which fits one page. If you haven't done much, then by all means include everything you can. However, if you have too much experience, then you need to choose what to include. \n\nYou need to ensure that your work experience is continuous (e.g. don't exclude the second RA position just because it is less relevant). Other than that, you have a lot of flexibility. I am not sure regarding combining RA positions, but I still think you can do it, given that the tasks are very similar and you list all universities.\n\nFinally, I would suggest focusing on the design of your resume.

I finished my PhD three years ago and hated it all. I too thought I was just really lazy. It's actually been quite a trip having to rethink a lot of my habits and outlook on things through an ADHD lens. But the cool thing is that it's a super well researched disorder with so much support around it.\n\nI didn't think I had it because I could \"hyperfocus\" and that I could work extremely efficiently when up against a deadline. But I'd do things like if there was something that was going to take me 18 hours of work, and I had a week to do it, I would do nothing for 6 days, then on the final day, maybe 18 or 17 hours before the deadline, I would start working on it and just not go to sleep, and then hand in the thing within minutes or seconds of the deadline.\n\nOne of the big contributers to my general feeling of self-worth was comparing my output at all times with the output level I had during my periods of hyperfocus.\n\nHowever, it turns out that hyperfocusing is an ADHD symptom (not just not being able to focus when you want). Also, people with ADHD only really deal with immediate consequences. By waiting until the last minute before starting work, I could experience the consequences immediately after completing my work - whereas if I finished it on time, or with time to spare, there would be a lag between when I finished the work and when the work needed to be handed in. So it just wasn't motivating for me to make any progress on the work until I HAD to.\n\nThis is extremely unsustainable, and it led into my professional life after my PhD. It finally caught up with me a few years later. With a PhD, I could just sleep for days on end and not go in to the office if I wanted to recover from one of these sessions. That just wasn't possible with work.\n\nI burned out. I stopped drinking caffeine to try and get healthier on the advice of a dietitian. And at that point I was unable to function in any useful capacity. I had zero motivation to do anything.\n\nSince getting my diagnosis, getting medicated, and now learning about the tools and techniques to take charge of my symptoms and the way my brain works - things have been getting a lot better. Turns out I'd been self-medicating with caffeine my entire adult life. I always thought it was weird that I could drink lots of caffeine and it wouldn't disrupt my sleep at all.\n\nIf you suspect you might have it - take a test and see if the symptoms match up ([The ASRS test is pretty good!](https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf)). You might not, and that's ok!\n\nIronically, while writing my thesis, someone I knew offered me some Ritalin and I turned it down because I wanted to have a point of pride around getting through my PhD \"clean\". When in fact, that's the exact sort of medication I SHOULD have been on to be able to have a level playing field with those around me.\n\nI'm doing my best not to dwell on the past too much. So many people have had it so much worse than me.

I've never been able to follow one of the schedules I had to write for official documentation, and as long as I put in the work and finish on time, nobody cares. Write your own schedule as you go along. If long term doesn't work for you, make it short term. One day, one week, one month - write it as you go along. As for the routine, try your best - some days will work, some will not. In the end, remember that it is not a sprint, it is a marathon!\n\nDepending on your topic, tangents can be good, as long as you don't go down rabbit holes. When you will be formatting your papers/thesis, you will put aside the ones that are not relevant - the others might lead you to breakthrough. \n\nIt takes time to get used to tough feedback but you'll get there - is there any way that you could get involved with grading duties, or reviewing, or similar tasks? I found it to be an amazing way to see that everyone makes mistakes and that the best thing to do is to accept graciously any kind of feedback (as long as it is constructive), and to admit that a perfect work does not exist, and that is perfectly alright!\n\nThis leads me to my other point - it might be good to work with your therapist to identify how to transform your difficulties into strength. For example, if you can control it, going on tangents is an amazing thing for academic research, same for perfectionism. It takes time, it might not always work, but it will help you in the long term. \n\nTalk with your peers as much as you can, so you can see that you're not alone, a lot of us have these issues! Especially when it comes to schedule, I haven't met many PhD student who always followed their official schedules perfectly (might be different in your field).\n\nOh and I'm a taker for any recommendations on social anxiety, I have the exact same problem and so far I don't have any solution for that.\n\nAnyway you're not alone in this, put yourself first, and know that it is alright not to feel alright!

There is no such thing as an employer saying, \"We love your work, but we're looking for someone with a Master's instead of a PhD for this job/promotion/whatever\". So it's more about where you are trying to go. Whether or not it's \"worth it\" depends on the person, their goals, and their values.\n\nAs for the stress, most things worth doing take a lot of work that occasionally sucks. A PhD can be a difficult experience filled with bullshit or a great experience that leads to growth and fulfillment. Your perspective on the experience depends a lot on who you are as a person, and some on the environment/culture. But the bullshit of \"advisor and curriculum expectations\" exists everywhere, it's just called hating your manager/corporation/bureaucracy.\n\nAs for the time commitment, a PhD (5-6 years) is more like 3 to 4 years more than it would take to get a Master's (2 years) in the US. And that time is factored into all the jobs that \"only require a Master's\". For example, the same job posting would say Master's plus 5+ years industry experience OR PhD required.\n\nAs for the job prospects, a PhD is (explicitly or tacitly) required for all academic positions and many senior positions in industry. Career options/advancement is a common reason for pursuing a PhD. Say a Master's in X field could get you a job in X field, but a PhD in X could get you a job in fields Q-Z. Additionally, a Master's in X field may allow you entry into the same position, but hold you back in terms of promotion. Besides, if someone really wants to be a professor, then who cares about the likelihood of actually becoming a professor. There are no guarantees for anything in life. There is no degree that guarantees you a job. Maybe generate a backup plan if you are in a competitive field, but go for what you want and see what happens. We all have one life.\n\nAs for the earning potential, a PhD doesn't hold you back from earning. That's absurd. Everyone I know who has recently graduated with a PhD has started their career earning six figures (this is STEM). Now, do most PhDs maximize their earning potential over the course of their careers? Probably not. But it's not because they have a PhD. It's because they value intellectual and creative freedom over money.

The timeframe to finish the studies is 7 years tops. When I started my studies, my workplace invested in me, they were open to improving their employee, so they are paying my fees. The field I research was not set by them, although I chose a close, but not identical area to my work. In return, I must finish within four years, and some additional years I must work for the company (I love my job, so I did not mind signing such a contract).

As lovely as I showed you how lucky I am, sacrifice was made from many sides: my personal life was a mess, especially for the first two years.

My husband supported me, which gave an enormous emotional aid to move forward and not give up. I was close so many times. My holidays were all filled with the PhD related duties.

It can be aggravating when this situation happens, because there's no way for you to know exactly what you're *supposed* to do. \n\nThey purposely don't give many examples because they want to avoid you copying some other person's work.

It's not about you bouncing along with everyone else, but about you coming into your own being of thinking.

Like I had built my study, got ethics approval, already had the funding (funding was allocated for my thesis project before it was assigned to me), etc. And my supervisor wanted to change shit and I had to be like \"dude - this isn't a minor revision, this is a big enough change to need to go through the ethics review again - and I don't have time for this shit\". And this would happen in every meeting, where they would talk about ideas, while I was solely concerned on finishing my thesis. It was like a team of dreamers and no one actually wanted to do any work.\n\nNow that I'm working for them as a contractor, I can't stop them from going out of scope. My contract has already been extended once (it was supposed to be for 3 months - it's now been almost 6). We blew past the deadline for the first conference we were going to submit to, and we're not going to meet the deadline for the next conference. Chances are, we're going to submit to our new target conference, NEXT YEAR.\n\nIf I was doing my PhD in this institute, I'd be preparing to quit. Luckily in my current university, I have a lot of agency over my own research. So I can move forward on my own without needing too much approval from my supervisor. I still need approval from my supervisor ofc, but I have control over the scope of my research. And luckily she's not a dreamer, so she also helps push me forward. \n\nI'm genuinely amazed some people have managed to find success in academia. Because holy shit they just don't ever fucking do anything. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I don't know how to help, because I'm also at my wits end with the other university. And I'm only a contractor with them, so I might just refuse to renew at some point.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n8rtrq/has_anyone_here_worked_on_a_project_with/gxl5o1m/"}, "1432": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Greedy_Landscape_489", "Date": 1620635952, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thanks for the tip!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n4mqem/how_do_you_quickly_overcome_overwhelmedness/gxl5wdu/"}, "1433": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Average_Iris", "Date": 1620636060, "Score": -3, "Body": "Most PhD's are not well-funded lmao", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n8z6iz/hi_everyone/gxl607m/"}, "1434": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Kateth7", "Date": 1620638698, "Score": 3, "Body": "Can you please provide more information?

I don't really mind this because it is handy when writing papers, since the fact that they are not so into what I am doing, makes them unbiased readers who can more easily pinpoint the things which are not well explained. The result is that this more often than not improves the writing and result presentation of my texts.\n\nOn the other hand, I knew an advisor from the group where I did my Master's that would be much more hands on. He would have a much deeper understanding of the methods proposed by his students. In two cases he had even contributed computer code to more effectively test the student's algorithms and methods. My Master's advisor, from the same group, however, was much like my PhD advisor and had only a limited idea of what I was doing.\n\nHaving said that, I think the advantages/disadvantages all boil down to the student.

I did my Masters in Canada but I'm now pursuing my PhD in Switzerland so I know these two systems. \n\n1. My top piece of advice is look up Professors you are interested in working with and see if you can talk to them about your above questions. A PhD supervisor has a huge amount of control over your PhD experience so choice in advisor is the most important thing. They can explain to you the funding in your field, what they can offer vs what you should apply to, whether they're supportive of you working part time, etc. Most Profs love talking about their work, and academics and generally giving advice so don't be shy but also know that most of them get tons of emails every day from prospective students so make it clear in your email that you have read some of their work and know what you're talking about and don't be afraid to email more than once.\n2. The financial situation will really depend on what you're used to. In Canada a PhD salary isn't great, at UBC it's in the 20 - 30k range ([https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/minimum-funding-policy-phd-students](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/minimum-funding-policy-phd-students)). Of course, this level of funding goes a lot further if you are living in for example Edmonton and not so far if you are living in Vancouver or Toronto but the level of funding is about the same across the country. There are also the SSHRC-CRSH ([https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/)) where you can apply for funding as an individual which can improve the financial situation and if you bring your own funding you'll have more flexibility in your choice of advisor. It is competitive funding though so no guarantee you'll get it. Again, the Professors will know more about what it takes in your field and what your odds are.  \nAs for going abroad, each country is different but in Switzerland the pay for a PhD student is much higher, of course so is the cost of living but I would say it's a much more comfortable margin to live on especially if you're coming from somewhere like Vancouver (as I did). Of course, abroad you have to consider that your teaching credentials might not transfer so you likely can't do that on the side (and visas might prevent it) and if your partner works, they will also have to consider what job options there are and potential language barriers although the universities usually operate in English.\n3. PhDs vary a lot, it's good to look back at how long students in the group you're thinking of joining have taken. In Canada the average is 4 - 5 years, in Europe more like 3 - 4 years. Of course it will take longer if you do it part time.\n\nHope this helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n76esz/considering_a_phd_in_education_canada_financial/gxp6oi6/"}, "1533": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TheGuyFromTheSummit", "Date": 1620712413, "Score": 30, "Body": "What really helps me, is planning my day ahead and scheduling almost every hour in my workday.\n\nI have fixed times for e-mail checking, reading paper, planning experiments and analysing data. \n\nSo I  always \"know\" what to do and do not lose any time thinking about \"what should be done next\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother advice would be: Do not compare yourself to others.

Every proof took a separate sheet of paper. And because I'd fuck it up so many times, by the end it was mostly illegible because of all the eraser marks. So I'd have to re-write every single proof.

I was never siloed within education. In fact, because my history is so low class, I probably have more \"street smarts\" than most of the people I see every day. It's not a comment people make *just* because you're in grad school, it's usually tied to other things as well: your mannerisms, whether you went directly from one degree to another, whether you supported yourself throughout uni or if your parents helped, whether you've ever worked a full-time job, etc. \n\n&gt;I just respond by saying that 'common sense' to me is just things like 'Don't touch the fire' or 'Don't walk in front of that car because it will hit you'.\n\nThat isn't really what people mean when they talk about \"common sense\". Those things are so \"common sense\" that they don't even register as \"common sense\" to people. Like you said, that's basic survival.\n\nCommon sense to them isn't about basic survival like \"fire hot\" or \"big fast car will hurt\". It's the unspoken rules in a culture for how things ought to be done. You should stand on the right on the escalator. You should walk on the right hand side of the road to face incoming traffic. You shouldn't wear flip flops if you're going hiking. Common sense can also cover general life things like the idea of taxes or something in the experience of having a full-time job outside of school, so if you've never had a full-time job outside of school (and not just something over the holidays), then those people will say you lack at least some common sense.\n\nSo I guess my point is that you can't convince this person otherwise, and if anything, your response only proved their point.

For a while it really pissed me off, and I had whole prepared spiels about the value of it and how hypocritical it was to demean drama and then go home and watch TV or whatever... but after a while I learned to let it go. Mainly for this reason: the people who were criticising my degree had *absolutely no idea what it involved.* So what value did their criticism really hold?\n\nThat's one part of this issue: the people who make these comments don't know what your work involves, and don't know what value it has. Most people are trained to see value in immediate economic terms: what job can you get from the degree? How much does that job pay? What product can you make and how much can you sell it for? Etc., etc. If your research doesn't have an immediately obvious financial value, a lot of people will see it as valueless, period. Which sucks, and you're welcome to make arguments back about it, but it's also worth accepting that that's just going to happen, and you want to pick your battles. For me, I found that making self-deprecating jokes about \"I know, I'm going to wind up a penniless waiter\" helped to stop other people making those criticisms, get us both laughing on the same side (which was a much nicer way for me to spend my time) and often opened the door to a more genial conversation about what it was I actually did, what value it had, and what it could lead to.\n\nThe other part of the issue is the specifics of this conversation with your cousin: it seems to me to be very much based in your cousin's insecurities about where they are in life, and not really about you. A comment out of the blue about how your education doesn't mean you're better than them probably means that a part of them believes that it *does*. And they're defending themselves against that fear of not being good enough. I'm no psychologist, but from my experience if you also get defensive, then the two of you just wind up in a cycle of pushing back against one another and getting more and more entrenched. So I wouldn't bother engaging, really. But you also have to make sure you do give yourself a moment to recognise that it's not you, it's them, which goes back to the point that *most people have absolutely no idea what your work involves*. So any criticisms they make are about what they imagine, not about reality. And what's the point of getting defensive about someone else's imagination?\n\nUltimately, most people don't do degrees in philosophy. Most people have absolutely no idea what it involves, or what value it has. But they are going to form opinions based around assumption, stereotypes, and good old making-stuff-up. All you get to do is decide how to respond. My preference is to accept that other people's beliefs aren't my problem, and let it go", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/n9svoc/does_anyone_ever_say_to_you_that_your_phd_is_not/gxprwxw/"}, "1578": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "mochi-jpg", "Date": 1620731575, "Score": 3, "Body": "I completely get how you feel. \n\nMy supervisor and his other PhD supervisee are like machines, churning out paper after paper after paper while I'm in my third (and hopefully final) year of my PhD, and I haven't even published one paper (it's never good enough for him). I do honestly feel like its mostly my fault and last year I had a complete mental breakdown because I felt so helpless and stupid. \n\nMy supervisor then became more understanding when I had no choice but to take a break from my Phd (with supporting documents from my counsellor &amp; psychiatrist), and he has since told me that he experienced the same thing as a PhD student.

That conversation helped a lot.\n\nNonetheless, I do strongly agree with another commenter here that sometimes you get lucky finding projects that are a much better match and it can affect your productivity. For instance, I managed to publish a paper in a reputable journal based on a 3 month research masters project in a project that I was more familiar with.\n\nI've been doing my PhD for almost 3 years, but not only is it relatively niche, but getting data (which I heavily rely on) is difficult due to funding issues, which leads to the supposedly low productivity (if you look at publications as the only measure of productivity). \n\nThere's a lot of tips on increasing productivity online, but I'd say a major stumbling block would be the mindset that publications = productivity. I honestly wouldn't say you're doomed, because people really progress at their own pace. It's better to fully understand a concept in your own time rather than rush through it for the sake of it because the end goal of a PhD is presenting your work, and if you aren't fully familiar with your project, you may end up tripping over yourself.

So I decided to make a \u201cSankey graph\u201d of my job search to hopefully help demystify the concept. Sankey graphs are pretty popular on r/dataisbeautiful for visualizing a job search.\n\n\r  \nMy background: I\u2019m currently mastering out of a PhD in neuroscience (I will be receiving a MS in neuroscience). I never really thought that I would be the one, out of my cohort, to leave the program. But, I started getting more and more disillusioned with my prospects as an academic researcher pursuing the tenure-track path, and starting looking into \u201calt-ac\u201d careers (still, with the intention of pursuing these careers with my PhD in hand). I eventually settled on nonprofit work\u2014either as a program coordinator/administrator, data analyst, or grant writer. As I researched these types of positions, and reached out to my network (which was sort of scary but definitely the smartest move I made!) to talk to people I know already in the nonprofit world, it quickly became apparent that my PhD wouldn\u2019t matter much, if at all. Unless I wanted to be the chief science officer at an international science/disease focused nonprofit, the PhD credential would not provide me with any sort of \u201cleg up\u201d\u2014experience seemed to matter the most. After learning this, I simply couldn\u2019t rationalize staying in my PhD program\u2014with its long hours, no real vacation, and low pay\u2014pursuing a degree that I would never need. So, I decided to master out. (My experience telling my PI is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/kwmjst/update_i_told_my_pi_im_mastering_out_it_went_well/)).\r  \nI would definitely say I was surprised by the number of applications I sent out that ended up being  \u201cghosted\u201d. Some job ads specifically said they would not initiate contact except to schedule an interview, which like\u2026fine\u2026but I was still surprised! On r/dataisbeautiful, having about half of your applications (if not more) be entirely ghosted (ie, no response whatsoever, not even a rejection) is about par for the course. I suppose I thought I would be different\u2026I also noticed that, for every 3-5 interviews a person had, there was one job offer. I found this to be true for me as well (out of my 41 applications, I moved to the first step (either a technical or phone screen) for only 3).\n\n\r  \nAs far as explaining why I was leaving my PhD program, I only had two phone screens where I could have potentially discussed it\u2014but it was basically a non-issue (YMMV depending on the field you\u2019re going into). In my first phone screen, the person I interviewed with was actually a fellow master-outer! And for the job offer I got, the person I interviewed with was also someone who felt jaded by academic research and went into the nonprofit world. My story was definitely not unique, and certainly no one seemed to hold me leaving my PhD program against me! If anything, I was complimented for knowing what I wanted to do and being willing to make a big change.\n\n\r  \nSo\u2026should YOU master out? It FEELS like a personal decision\u2026but I encourage you to think about it like you would any other career decision. You do not OWE anyone anything\u2014not your PI, not your parents, not your lab mates, not your 10-year-old self who dreamed of being a scientist one day. It is critical that you do what is best for you\u2014your mental health, your career aspirations, your wallet.

Although I've never said to my (29F) husband (29M) that my work was more important to me than him, I have to say that my actions certainly made it clear to him and here are some examples: \n\n1. When we first started dating I made it clear my career was very important to me and my priority and I even said things like if he wanted to have kids with me he'd have to be a stay at home dad cause I wouldn't have time for my kids either... 2. I worked the week and even day before my wedding, you could say it's not a big deal, but it was because we decided to do a lot of things ourselves (like gifts and invitations and decorations etc.) which ended up putting a lot of pressure on him. 3. I worked during our honeymoon, as in pulling an all nighter at some point and then being too tired the next day for some of the visits we had in freakin' Japan (I'm just eyerolling at myself right now... seriously some of my priorities were so messed up...). 4. Everytime his parents came for a visit I made it clear to him I didn't have time to entertain them or take vacation to be with them and would work instead of visiting towns around.\n\nThis is just a few examples. I honestly do wonder why he stuck around for the past 6 years but I guess there were also other things that made it clear to him that he was important to me too, although not number 1 in my list of priorities.\n\nAnother thing I share with your boyfriend is that I also have anger issues, and with the stress of my PhD, I have taken it out on my parents and sisters a lot when I lived with them, but NEVER on my husband. I think in some ways I chose him because he is so calm and never gets angry which makes it impossible for me to lash out in anger at him. This has certainly played a role in us staying together. However he did have to live with my stress, which meant some days I just didn't want to talk to him because I needed to be on my own to cope with the anger. It also meant some days I was too exhausted to do anything...\n\nI disagree with one of the comments here saying that PhD is just like any other job... I had a very complicated relationship with my first supervisor which made it extremely stressful to me. Any other job with a similar situation, I would have quit but I was sticking around to get this stupid diploma (I felt like I had worked too hard to not get this reward). Until it got too much and I had to change supervisors and restart my PhD project after 4 years. (Restarted so I could get this stupid diploma). But in the meantime my vision completely changed and I was done with academia and research altogether and would rather die than do a postdoc. I have so many regrets at where I set my priorities for all the past few years and it's funny because at the end of my PhD my husband was the one supporting me the most to finish when all I wanted was to be done with it. \n\nThis is my little bit of nuance. In no ways do I mean to say this is fine and his behaviour is justified, but I wanted to say that sometimes you can love a person to the moon and back and just not make them a priority. It can also be very specific to the current situation of the person given that now that I am done with the PhD, my husband is certainly my priority (But if I had decided to continue in an academic career, would it have been the case? I'm not sure it would...). But we started dating when I was already a PhD student and he kind of knew what he was getting into at the time. I also had made rules to myself (even when the PhD was my priority) that work stopped at the doorstep of our house, which made our home a safe space for the both of us.\n\nAnd now here's a question: Is his situation extremely tense due to a bad relationship with his supervisor, for example? Or is he in circumstances that exacerbate his stress? Something like a failing project or hypothesis for example. Or is it really just the stress of the job? If it's the latter and he took the postdoc position, I agree with other commenters and would advise you to move on, things will probably not change (and might even get worse as he progresses in an academic career where pressure just keeps building up) and what you are going through is already highly unfair to you. \n\nAnd my last point will be that I know it must be very hard to turn the page especially you probably have invested so much in this relationship. I understand because I feel like I was in a relationship with my PhD for all these years. At first I thought it was my everything, and then this got hard and I worked even more to make it work and invested more and more of myself. Then one day I realised I gained nothing in return and I was not okay with it and decided to turn the page on it. And although it seemed like such a waste to give up after giving so much of myself in this \"relationship\" with my PhD, I know in my heart that I needed to go through all of this to realise it just couldn't work...\n\nSorry for the very long response.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/na834o/my_partners_phd_is_making_me_want_to_end_things/gxtgq41/"}, "1703": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Twinson64", "Date": 1620794166, "Score": 7, "Body": "That is a big pay jump.

If you have good academic standing and other industry experience or anything similar, that will almost certainly be enough. Applications are almost always considered holistically \n\n- if you already know you want to be a research assistant or a lab tech, you should probably get a PhD or at least a MS. I\u2019m not in biology, so my experiences aren\u2019t 1:1, but in my field (orbital mechanics) the only people researching outside of academia are PhDs or a very select few people with Masters degrees. \n\n- it\u2019s super normal to be overwhelmed. I\u2019m definitely not one of those people who had all their ducks in a row and applied to a million schools and visited and had checklists and a million conversations. I applied to 2 schools, but really only wanted to apply to one. I knew who I wanted to work with and that made it way easier. \n\n- almost every single person I\u2019ve ever met in graduate school (even attending one of the best universities for what I do) has impostor syndrome. A mentor and postdoc I once had told me he STILL had impostor syndrome, even after defending and then going on to help direct a lab. It\u2019s normal.\n\n- a lot of us live with high, difficult to manage levels of anxiety, and many of us manage mental or physical illnesses in addition to that. It\u2019s part of willingly subjecting yourself to a high stress environment for many years! That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth it or impossible to control or manage. It\u2019s about willingly putting yourself first, taking things one step at a time, and finding an advisor you think you can build a relationship with that is at least mostly based on honesty and care. Remember you exist outside your PhD, and that at the end of the day it really is just a job. You have at least one entire degree to fall back on if you end up pulling out of the program for any reason. There\u2019s no shame in quitting a job. Same goes for PhD. Keep growing as a person and make time for your passions and interests and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\n- you sort of contradict yourself at the end - if indeed all you want is a job in one of those listed areas, there is no need to get a PhD! A PhD is meant to let you add \u201cresearch\u201d to your skillset, and then set you up to do that in the future. If you don\u2019t want to do research, don\u2019t get a PhD. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in pursuing this, just take it as slow as you can. There\u2019s no rush. Finding an advisor you would like to work with and a place you will be happy living for a few years are the two most important steps :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nafaw3/is_it_normal_to_feel_overwhelmed_just_thinking/gxvewof/"}, "1767": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Mila999", "Date": 1620838084, "Score": 2, "Body": "Hey I recognize her, think I follow her on Twitter :D.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/napkxd/my_advisor_shared_this_in_our_research_group_chat/gxvf5wj/"}, "1768": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "funnyprofessor", "Date": 1620838269, "Score": 3, "Body": "I hope this helps.

A bad mentor can make the entire experience miserable and I would say is one of the main reasons why people end up quitting. If you can\u2019t select your mentor, then I would suggest trying to build a good relationship from the start in hopes that you guys can work well together.

Maybe you don't get an answer, maybe the answers you get are not relevant enough, maybe you don't have resources to keep going. \n\nAnd, when you reach a dead end (something quite common), you rarely know what's the best thing to do. Should you consider it the end, give up, and start another project? Or should you take a few steps back, make some changes in the project, and try again following a different path?\n\nIf you decide to give up, maybe you gave up too soon. Maybe there was another methodology that would get the results you wanted. \n\nIf you decide to try again, maybe you are just beating a dead horse. \n\nDoing research is trying to find something that nobody found before. So, nobody really knows how to get there. What's the best methodology? What is the best theories to explain the phenomenon?

So, it's really easy to get lost in the ocean of knowledge that exist. \n\nFor me, the best way to deal with it is to talk to more experienced researchers, especially the advisor. But, as I said, nobody really knows to get there. So, you can get very conflicting feedback. Some people will say your research is a piece of crap, a total waste of time.

I am currently using \"Trello\" ([https://trello.com/](https://trello.com/)). It is free and you can create \"Boards\" where you place cards with tasks you have to do. You can also separate these cards into different lists within the same board. For example, I have a board called \"PhD\", and it has several lists, including \"Paper X\", \"Paper Y\", \"Project Z\", etc. Each list has its tasks such as \"Write Introduction\", \"Read paper W\", or \"Run experiments\". Each task may also have a \"description\", so you can really go from a \"broad view\" down to \"minute details\". \n\nI have found that listing all tasks in a whole board gives me (1) a broad view of how much I have to do (and the time I have if I set deadlines for tasks) and (2) a satisfaction of removing cards from my lists as I complete them, so I can literally \"see my progress\".

What helped was identifying signs of emotional abuse and confronting him with those, while learning as much as I could about setting healthy boundaries. Eventually we got divorced and things worked out so much better for both of us--definitely for me, but he seems to have done just fine without me too. Eventually when he saw that I have boundaries now he asked for a divorce and found a new person to rely on. I didn't have good role models growing up for setting healthy boundaries, leading me to severely undervalue my own time and effort, which made it easy for others to take advantage of me.

When I went through it with my ex, it was like a nightmare that lasted for years. And for much of it, I blamed myself a lot for what was happening instead of recognizing that I was doing the best I could in extremely challenging circumstances.\n\nThis website helped me identify patterns of emotional abuse I was experiencing: [https://outofthefog.website/top-100-trait-blog/2015/11/4/emotional-abuse](https://outofthefog.website/top-100-trait-blog/2015/11/4/emotional-abuse)\n\nThe metaphor of \"fog\" they use really resonated with me because being in this kind of relationship created a weird sort of mental fog with a strong sense of obligation to him, leading me to feel I was actually \"trapped\" in a marriage that wasn't fulfilling any of my needs and was actually harmful to my wellbeing and health. \n\nIf you're experiencing some of these things in your relationship, whatever you do DON'T do marriage counseling--if your spouse is emotionally abusive, she'll find a way to make everything your fault without doing any work on herself, and you'll wind up in a worse place than if you hadn't gone to counseling--that's  how it was for us anyway, and a lot of other couples where one person doesn't want to do the work on themselves.\n\nInstead, read up on how to set healthy boundaries for yourself--often it starts by just identifying what you need in order to live a healthy life and be productive. For me it was setting limits on long arguments or discussions to allow for the amount of rest and sleep time I need, having the right to tell him when something bothered me that he did, and insist I didn't like it when he belittled me or attacked my character verbally instead of pointing out as constructive criticism something I could change. There was more too but those were the main ones. Just by insisting on those basic rules and speaking up when he didn't follow them, I changed the dynamic in our relationship and he realized he couldn't emotionally abuse me so easily anymore, so he chose to move on.\n\nContrary to what these people tell you, they are capable of living without you. They actually have more skills than they let on. They just try to get your sympathy endlessly so that you'll take care of them to the point of neglecting yourself. \n\nAlthough counseling doesn't work for people like this, if you're actually afraid of them or afraid of what they will do if you stand up to them for what you need, you can take advantage of crisis response services in your area, and if you decide to separate and negotiate a parenting plan etc., you can use a service for mediation. Having a neutral third party there for these high-stakes negotiations can protect you from having to approach them from a place of actual fear of what would happen if you stand up for what you need, want, and believe to be true. Even if you have a good friend you can call in to have present when you tell an abuser what you need, it can help de-escalate the situation and protect you from any harm or fear of harm to you or your child during that scary process. \n\nIn my case I had to go through all those steps (setting boundaries, crisis response team, calling in a neutral third party, etc.) to get to where I am now,  and I'm not saying necessarily the marriage has gotten that bad in your case--maybe you can achieve a healthier relationship with your spouse by telling her clearly what you need for a healthy home life and telling her when you're not getting that and why. I hope she will listen to you and respect your boundaries. If she does, and if she's willing to work on herself for the good of the family as a whole instead of blaming you for everything, the other steps like crisis response and mediation won't be necessary. But if she doesn't listen to you and you have a home life that doesn't allow you to rest and refresh your mental energy for the intellectual work you have to do during the day, there's nothing wrong with leaning on friends and others to make sure you can establish healthy boundaries. That will help both you and your child in the long run. \n\nBest of luck!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/nd9aip/need_to_vent_feeling_like_i_screwed_myself/gycnwfj/"}, "2218": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "_k547", "Date": 1621190435, "Score": 5, "Body": "To be honest I think you should build both simultaneously, and here\u2019s why. \n\nGetting stuck, not knowing which way to turn or how to overcome an issue during your studies is pretty much a daily occurrence.

For me, it took a combination of strategies. but what helped the most was talkIng to others and also getting counseling. It helped shift my perspective on things then I was able to bounce back in a better place/space. Since then, I have better control. \n\nI include mind-body practices into my days now and I've been able to better manage. Mentally, some things I do to maintain are having 30mins of sitting in silence, meditation(even if it's just 5mins of focusing on my breathing), watching a few TedTalks on topics I'm interested in like motivation, leadership, etc. I have post-it notes of quotes that I love all around my desk, and some are just inspirational messages/mantras I wrote for myself. \n\nSometimes I'll use imagery in meditation. Like, imagining how awesome its going to feel when I hit the Submit button for the last time, pass my Orals, and get my degree out of the mailbox. Or I'll just sit and visualize what graduation will be like, how it'll feel after having gone through this intense process, who might come to it, what I should do/eat afterwards, etc. I just like to imagine what it'll feel like done. I'm looking forward to THAT part of life. \n\nChanging habits also helped. I had to work with my procrastination tendencies. I found it helpful to start with a small goals each day. For example, dissertation writing wasn't the only thing I procrastinated on so I started picking 3 things I could do every day that I wouldn't usually do. Like, doing things I'd usually avoid or ignore, doing something new, or accomplishing a desired task. Once I knock out the 3 small goals, everything else accomplished is a bonus. I  helped me get into the habit of being a goal achiever. \n\nFor my body, I learned more about it's complexity after going to a chiropractor, and other complementary and alternative medicine practices. Now I can better tell when I'm starting to get stressed or having tension and I can counteract it. I also do some somatic movement practices, they are great for optimal health and wellbeing. I've incorporated stretches regularly and paying better attention to tension areas. Somatic massages and learning self-massage techniques have also been helpful. I've also incorporated fun dance workout vids and nutritional changes too. \n\nThese are just some of my strategies, they continue to evolve though.

And that includes how much freedom we should expect.\n\nI will tell my experience, as a 4th-year student.\n\nThe amount of freedom I had changed a lot over time.\n\nIn the beginning, I didn't have that much freedom. I was able to choose my topic of interest, but I think that only worked well because that was a good match with my advisor. He already had some similar ideas, already had some resources available. With a bad research fit, I probably would be forced to do something else, as I see happening with other students here.\n\nBut, during the research itself, I mostly followed what my advisor said. And, in the end, that study didn't result in anything relevant, we gave up on that, we won't work on it any further.\n\nFour projects later, the situation is very different now. I do have much more freedom, I have much more power to decide what to do.\n\nOf course, I still check with my advisor, get his opinions. But, oftentimes, he tells me that I should know more than he does by now, since I have been working on this stuff for years. So, he gives me his opinions, but leaves the decision to me. Recently, that included important changes in methodology, how to use the money we got from the grand, and whether we should bring another professor on board as co-author, for example.\n\nSo, I think I had to earn my freedom. I had to first convince my advisor that he could trust me before I had more freedom.\n\nOne of the things that worked for me, and maybe can work for you. When I say that something is a bad idea, I need to have sound arguments for that. The advisor doesn't. It's my work to show that he is wrong or that something doesn't work. I need to have evidence of that. And usually that takes a lot of work, maybe get the full results. Sometimes I believe or feel that something is not good, but I can't make decisions based on beliefs or feelings, my advisor expects to see evidence of that.\n\nAlso, when I say that something is wrong or bad, I should be able to tell what's the better alternative then. Something better than what I have now. If I see a problem, I try to get some potential solutions to that problem before talking to my advisor. You wrote that you have been reporting the problems and worries. But have you also been reporting ways to solve those problems and alleviate those worries? When you say that the results will be no less speculative, did you have any idea that could make them less speculative? My advisor advises me, but often he doesn't tell me how to solve the problems I found. He can tell if he thinks it's a problem or not, he can maybe recommend some papers or authors to check, but it's usually up to me to find the solution.\n\nLast meeting, for example, I proposed a change in the methodology. Something quite drastic actually. But that I believe it to be better than what we had before, and it would address some concerns people have. And, of course, my advisor can be against that. When he started questioning about potential problems that we could have with the new approach, I told him I had already thought of those problems, and had already conducted some preliminary analyses to see if they would indeed be a problem. So, I presented the problem, my solution to the problem, and how I had already checked for potential problems of this new solution.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nj81nt/how_much_academic_freedom_a_phd_student_should/gz5yk09/"}, "2868": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Giotto_diBondone", "Date": 1621781114, "Score": 2, "Body": "Ouuu!

The first is simply accessing secondary data. Assuming there are no repositories (unfortunately nothing great existed for my needs) you can extract data from previous research. For example, I did an individual participant data MA and digitised in-text figures as well as contacting the authors for raw data. So, that\u2019s an option. Depending on your needs, aggregate data (i.e effect sizes) may be sufficient for your needs.\n\nThe other option is to simulate data. Again, this involves going back to previous research such that you can have reasonable justifications for model and distributional assumptions etc. After that you can draw data from a distribution with defined mean and variance etc to fit your needs. It\u2019s worth noting you can make these two approaches complimentary. I personally used the parameter estimates from my meta-analysis in combination with other pockets of research to define the assumptions for my simulations. \n\nHappy to chat more over DM if that might help. Hopefully this was useful. To summarise: Secondary data (directly from authors, or extracted from studies), simulation, or some combination of both. \n\nAs far as software goes, R is a programming language and is completely free access. There are a tonne of packages for it and a tremendous amount of online (fully reproducible) examples with code. The learning curve is actually ok too.

If I could do it again, I would **not**. The main reason for that is that the PhD is really only necessary if you're after an academic job. I took it up purely out of interest, never wanting to be an academic; my time researching has only heightened my distaste for the academic life. I would sooner work a drudge job to make ends meet and have the freedom to spend my intellectual and creative energies how I liked, than be saddled with the mental workload of a professional researcher, compelled not only to plough very narrow intellectual fields but also to attend conferences, write articles and books, teach and, increasingly, perform administrative duties. In short, I would say that if you don't see the PhD being useful to your career, don't do it, even if like me they give you a scholarship. The scholarship isn't spectacular, you'll earn much better working; you also won't end up hating something (e.g. Nietzsche's philosophy) that you maybe loved when you began.\n\nSo as not to be entirely negative, one positive that has come from doing the PhD is learning what it takes to produce a book-length work, which for me meant largely learning to persevere. The PhD program provided an environment that forced me to be more diligent in my work. So perhaps if you aspire to work as a writer, the PhD will be useful even if you don't want to be an academic.\n\nIn sum: Don't do what I did and idly take it up. Think about how you'll earn your money while you're doing it, think about how much money you'll earn, think about the career prospects it leads to and whether those are prospects you want or care about, think about what else you could be doing with your time. On this last point, for example, would you rather spend (at least) 4 years working towards a PhD or the same amount of time in learning German so that you can read Nietzsche (and other thinkers) in the original language (assuming you don't already)? These are obviously questions that only you can answer. But just remember: There are costs to pursuing a PhD. I wish I had spent my time instead travelling to learn other languages while teaching English, reading, and cultivating my artistic abilities. The PhD for me has been (almost) a complete waste of energies and time.

I had a similar experience with an MD degree that I started some years back and gave up on after one semester to pursue a PhD in the humanities; while I sometimes compare the two routes and think I would have been smarter to get the MD because of career prospects and so on, the simple fact is that medicine---although it interests me to this day; I still have my textbooks and read them---wasn't right for me. Too much rote learning, too restrictive of my intellectual horizons, and the job itself too demanding of my time. And I was making those decisions at 29 (I'm 33 this year); you've got even more of your life ahead of you than I do, and if you've been studying for most of it, maybe what you need more than anything is a break.

Here are the things I learned to do and that helped quite a bit to stay organized!\n\n1) For folders, I would start with some various general ones like \"writing\", \"progress assessment\", \"research dissemination\" but also stuff that are more project-specific like \"comparative genomic\", \"phenotyping\" and \"sequencing\" for example. Then for each of those, you can have subfolders. For example for the writing folder, I have a subfolder for each manuscript and the thesis. Then for each of those, I have various folders like \"figures\" or \"versions\" or even \"analysis\". For files, it is important to name them correctly! Check [this link](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) regarding file naming best practices.\n\n2) For time management, I have some major recommendations\n\n* Use a calendar religiously! Seriously, note down everything. Feel free to also add stuff as private. I do that too, when I don't want people in my group to necessarily know what I am working on this or that minute. What I log can be divide into two types: one type are \"full day writing\", for this I usually write \"LAMP-paper\" either as a full day event or at the start of the day - I don't write down details about what I plan on writing, that's on paper - and I explain it below. The second type is small recurring things, like \"update plan\" or lab work etc.\n* I do a prioritization matrix and update it regularly. You can find an example [here](https://www.process.st/checklist/prioritization-matrix-checklist-template/). It really gives you clarity and what i call \"head space\": basically making space for important things in the *now*. The list might be super long, yes, but you don't have to think about it now - it's for later. This can really be helpful to focus on the important things. \n* Another thing I do is I write down on pieces of paper lists of stuff I need to do for things like a lab experiments, a manuscript revision or even manuscript writing. These are very personal and no one else sees them (as opposed to the calendar for example). \n* Meeting with supervisors are important and a balance about independence and supervision should be reached - and will definitely depend on a lot of factors. For example at the very beginning, you might be starting out very fresh and might need more guidance, say once a week. Then with time comes more independence and self reliance so you might need one meeting a month. I wouldn't do less often than a meeting a month - I think it is important to keep in touch for your supervisor that often, as it would help stay on track and not stray much!\n\nImportant to keep in mind that those things are learned so you kinda have to force yourself to do them, they won't come naturally (not at first anyway)! If you have *toooooo much* troubles sticking to that, the important thing is to recognize it and then seek advice as to why.\n\nWish you all the best!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nkhn87/how_do_you_stay_organized/gzd8u3d/"}, "3043": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Kateth7", "Date": 1621928277, "Score": 6, "Body": "So real talk, professors being nice are more important than department ranking.

But I still want to do my PhD. Not for the title or the usefulness; I am very sure I mostly will never end up using whatever texts I learn during my PhD.

I think that those who read and discuss the great works---be it privately, in web fora, in reading groups, or just with a few friends---and reflect on them in relation to their own experiences do more to keep the spirit of philosophy alive than a whole shelf of well received and highly graded dissertations that have each been read by about five people and are now just collecting dust, waiting to be pulped, digitized or inadvertently binned.\n\nSo when I say that my PhD has been a complete waste of time and energy, my point is that there was a better path that would have allowed me to read what I have read and gain the insights I have gained while better meeting the practical demands of living and better serving my other aspirations in the short and long term. Book-knowledge is all well and good, but there's also a whole world out there to be heard, touched, tasted, smelled and seen, and for the past four years I have often wondered which part of it I would be encountering had I not made the much-regretted decision to chain myself to a desk and computer when books can be carried in a bag and Amazon delivers to over 100 countries.\n\nAnyway, it'll probably all come down to personal preference and aspirations, and if you say that the external push factor is important, then a PhD program certainly supplies that in the form of institutional expectations.\n\nThanks for replying.

I don't think you necessarily need to keep yourself organised. Keeping organised suggests to me always putting things (back) \"where they belong\", whereas tidying means intermittently reigning in the disorder which is a natural part of life. My workspaces and PhD USB regularly end up in a state of disarray, with books and articles dumped in piles that make sense at the time and multiple copies of files saved haphazardly in an array of folders. At the end of every month or so I attend to this mess by going through everything and putting it back into some kind of order; in doing this, I often come across notes I made or articles I read but forgot about, which sometimes stimulate new ideas or remind me of old ones that slipped my mind. It's like letting plants grow and then cutting them back, letting them grow and then cutting them back, and so on.\n\nThe only thing I would recommend keeping some order with is: 1) your ideas, and 2) your deadlines and milestones, and 3) your references.\n\nAs regards (1), I think it's important to have a central document or notebook where you right down all of your ideas with detailed references where appropriate. For example, if you read an article and that stimulates a number of ideas, then get down those ideas as soon as possible and make sure you make notes about what you were reading at the time that prompted the thought, or any other relevant contextual factors. That way when you come back to it down the road, you know which papers to consult. --- My preference is for a notebook, because I think one processes things better when one writes them down by hand; the downside of this is if you lose the notebook, you lose your ideas.\n\nAs regards (2), I keep a physical piece of paper with a hand-written list of relevant deadlines and milestones stuck on the wall above my computer, which is where I'm often working. That way when I lean back from a bit of reading or writing, I can scan the page and check what's coming up. If you have a lot of milestones/deadlines, it might be worth getting a wall calendar which lets you write up the whole month or semester or year for an overview. You can, as other respondents have said, also program a lot of this stuff into your phone. (But the wall calendar makes for a nice break from staring at screens.)\n\nAs regards (3), I don't use a citation or reference manager, I just type up the details of any papers I use into a reference list in the appropriate format as soon as possible (and save the list in multiple locations).\n\n**Please note**, I say all this as a researcher in the humanities, and I have a preference for working in \"less efficient\" ways, because my work involves a lot of re-reading which can often stimulate new thoughts; so perhaps what I'm suggesting will not be of use to you if you are in the natural sciences and/or can't afford the time expense of doing things manually.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nkhn87/how_do_you_stay_organized/gzhmdwu/"}, "3200": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "RedPandaCub1", "Date": 1622015265, "Score": 1, "Body": "That is amazing!

So something is definitely *off* here. It could be a multitude of things (prof too stressed, has no time, your research doesn't interest you any longer or anything else, really).  One very telling thing is that you and your lab mate are his first students - prof probably has literally no clue, no training and no support himself to get through it but that actually isn't your problem to solve.  \nHe isn't providing adequate supervision and support, and he **should b**e. If you think you can have a heart to heart to tackle reasons behind his behaviours, it might be worth it to do so. However, if you think for any reason that this isn't the way to go, then obviously it can be skipped - and the focus turned into what to do to obtain what you need.  \nSo regarding the various things in your post, I'll try to give some ideas of things you might try.   \nThe paper: write him again, reminding him of what he said (that he will do that part), mention that you can also do the part since he clearly has no time for it. Tell him \"please, let me know you have read the email\". If he does, without addressing the issue or with saying \"I am too busy\" WITHOUT giving the ok for you to finish his parts, then I would flag it as Mediator Needed (will explain that at the end of the post). I can also suggest you do the part he was responsible for but I have no idea how he'd react so you can still consider that too.\n\nLab keys: for this, I would actually email the department secretary with your prof in CC asking for keys. I find it very disrespectful on his side and it is time you take matters in your own hands, especially for something like that but you will need support. If the department secretary mentions that no, your prof has to give the ok, suggest the secretary to call him or something. \n\nMeetings and \"he has said that he prefers to show us stuff before we do them\": he cannot     really demand you show him everything, especially if he doesn\u2019t even give timely feedback\u2026 that\u2019s not how things work and this is a major problem if he doesn\u2019t change his ways. This also needs a Mediator.\n\nSo it is clear that not all problems are as severe as one another but some could become seriously issues. Since you're already 1.5 years in, do you have a committee yet? Do you know someone (postdoc, prof, anyone really) in your department who you're in good terms with? Does your uni have mediating services? Ombudsmen? Now it might be an overreaction *for now* but I recognize the signs and left unaddressed, it could lead to major problems down the line. The sooner you fix them, the better. And you might need some help doing that. \n\nIt is important that you show initiative to wanting to fix the issues, though, especially if you decide to talk to someone about those issues.

So if you don't feel comfortable talking to you supervisors, maybe reach out to someone else, like the director of the phd program, lab leader etc. \n\nHonestly, making friends is hard as an adult, both inside and outside Scandinavia.

Friends are often someone you have things in common with.\n\nAlso, you should probably put in some effort in learning the language. Many friend groups would probably find it bothersome to have to change their language just to accommodate one person. It is also a lot to expect for a whole group to speak another language rather than one person.

For example, for me, I just wanted to do more research in a field I only slightly broached during my masters. Also in my field phds do give a work advantage.

Congratulations on the new beginning, it is both exciting and scary! The first green flag is that you already know the team and you've worked with it and you're very comfortable at your university - so this is boding well! \n\nFor organisational advice, I wrote a comprehensive comment  a few days ago, check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nkhn87/how_do_you_stay_organized/gzd8u3d/?context=3)! This was tailored to the need of the poster so if you'd like specific organizational advice relating to something specific let me know! \n\nIs your dissertation manuscript based? In any case, taking a scientific writing course is invaluable. My writing wasn't bad before but after taking a course, it improved dramatically. For writing, my main suggestion is to usually start with writing down headlines (introduction, results, etc...) then writing down whatever comes to your mind for each section. Keep doing that until you have a wall of text for each section which you can refine using tips from scientific writing courses. Of course you can also find your own tips and tricks but starting from a page that isn't blank/empty tremendously helps!\n\nFor keeping track of bibliography, I always recommend [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), unlike EndNote, you do not need to pay for it and thus can keep using it after you graduate. You can also do quite a few things, like add comments for each article or add tags and then filter by tags, etc... \n\nFor lifestyle recommendations, I have a few realisations/observations (they did apply to me, and might apply to you but also might not, I would just keep an eye out for them):\n\n1) The first 1.5 years I didn't work weekends and that was okay. In the remaining times, I sometimes had to and that was okay as well. **However**:\n\n* No one ever forced me to work on weekends, it was my own choice! If someone (PI or postdoc) forces you or bullies you into working weekends, this is a *red flag.* \n* It was **not** every weekend, and I compensated with mental health days, vacation days or slow days after working weekends. \n\nMy main work related lifestyle change from previous degrees was then to know when weekend/very late work was necessary and when it wasn't; also when to say \"stop! I need a break and I need it *now*\". You have to be hyper-vigilant about what your body and mind is telling you.\n\nTake some time to discover the new city in the first months and do try to make friends, safely of course! Get to know your student associations (there usually are a ton!). Establish a (new?) routine that works for you in the new environment: for example it could be daily walks, it could be reading before bed, it could be having coffee in bed in the morning, etc... I found those very important to keep going. I also urge you not to say no to *good, healthy* relationships, if you aren't in one already, and to maintain yours, if you are in one. Many people stay single during their PhD \"because there is no time\" - I truly believe time can be found with good management and compromises from both parties. My own good and healthy relationship with my SO is truly a very important pillar during my PhD. \n\nA final comment: you and your health are the most important, and it is important not to burn out. Also important not to cave into imposter syndrome, as you might very well feel it at one point of your phd. Good to recognize it and gets tools (mental mostly) to address it. Many people including me think about quitting at some point. If/when that time comes for you it is important to know **why** you're feeling what you're feeling: is it a temporary feeling from feeling super tired and fed up with things and things could be improved OR is it something deeper stemming from other things (huge red flags like a bullying PI, unhealthy lab environment, for example). It is important to keep that in mind!\n\nThis is getting long, phew!

Regardless a few hours later I noticed that he did email the secretary so I was able to finally get these keys. I find this very inefficient as I've mentioned previously that I don't have keys and the more I mention it and nothing gets done the more time is wasted, but I guess it is ok since it is my time that is wasted and I am the student.\n\nWe communicate via a chat option our university provides us with, so for things like \" I need keys\" I wouldn't send an email but rather a message.

I think this is crucial.  I would also try to find student counselling services as they can point you out to relevant parties/orgs/people who can help you out.\n\nAfter you feel better enough, you can think about what *you* and only *you* want. It is very important to self-reflect about the why of things, and not just do it because of the flow of life. It isn't easy to self-reflect but it is necessary. Regarding why you want to do a PhD, it is okay if you decide it isn't for you. Nothing changes for you. Your worth isn't tied to the title, or your research or anything like that. I know it is difficult to internalize but it is true: you and your research/achievements are separate. \n\n&gt;I know that quitting my PhD is probably the best, but I cannot imagine the grief over that loss.\n\nYou're right in the sense that it cannot continue like this. It is also very valid to not want this for yourself by the way. So if you do quit, no matter what anyone thinks or says or does, rest assured: you did right.\n\nBefore taking the decision, though, could you you revisit the situation when you are in a better position mentally? Do you think the situation would be different if you had another supervisor? If yes, I would see if it is possible to change supervisor while keeping the project. \n\nIf not, then quitting is definitely the best solution for you.\n\nI can relate to your post a lot! Also doing a phd in a foreign countrify so it is extra tough. \n\nI started my first phd position in 2017 and quit it after 13 months for various reasons but what you wrote here really resonated with me and I can definitely relate. I talked to a lot of people (student counsellors, other profs, ombudsmen and even the vice rector of phd students) and realized that it wasn't the phd idea that I didn't like but *this* phd idea. So I found another position where the supervisors are great and even though it is tough and I also went into ups and downs, they were manageable because I always had the support of my supervisors (which I think is the most important thing).\n\nPlease let me know if you need more targeted or specific advice, I would be happy to help. Also feel free to share the country you are in (if you feel comfortable with that).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nmwhn6/phd_drama_should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/gzr69fm/"}, "3514": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "smartaxe21", "Date": 1622207907, "Score": 7, "Body": "This is actually a common misconception atleast in the pharmaceutical sector/Biotech.

Try to get your dissertation thesis, project goals, and your advisors expectations defined if you already know what you will be working on.\n\n5. Keep notes of all the meetings you have with your advisor. Often times they forgot and tell you to do one thing, but expect something else. \n\n6. Try to keep a good work life balance. Join a club or go to the gym. That will keep you sane. \n\n7. When I started, I used to work on the weekends initially to get upto speed. Once i felt comfortable with what I was doing, I would go on the weekends if I needed something to be done. So, its upto you what you need to do.\n\n8. Try to have your boundaries. Advisors can get crazy with phone calls at night or on weekends. In emergencies like project deadlines is fine. \n\n9. Also, don't think about your graduation. Try to enjoy your journey and work.

You, as a reader, can find the things that are lacking in clarity.\n\nFor a less good paper, there will be significant issues with the items above usually these will fall into considerable issues with the methodology or the results.

It's 4-6 years of your life devoted to one single thing, and you have to be liking it enough to be going through that process. You become a very different person after going through a PhD.\n\n&gt;It was never about me showing off the title next to my name as something that makes me proud, as I don't have high ego and don't act and never think like I am better than anyone else. But in some way it seems I observe my (and only mine not anyone's else) worth through going through this process of obtaining a PhD or not.\n\nThe reality is that the PhD isn't a contest, even though it's set up that way on the academic end of things. At its very heart, it is a search for answers to a question that... well, most people may not give a shit about.\n\nThat's not an easy thing to go through. And because it's so different between people, the success and learning you get out of it also becomes so varied.\n\nAs an outside observer, much of how you describe things is in terms of hitting checkpoints, extrinsic goals. The PhD itself is such a brutal thing to go through that if you're being led by extrinsic, tangible goals (e.g. more money, more respect, more opportunity), it will more than not be very, very difficult to go through and finish. And in many cases, \"finishing\" at any cost may be more detrimental than it's worth.\n\nYou need to figure that out, what your motivations are, and whether the PhD really does accomplish just that. There's nothing wrong with wanting more pay and respect, but the PhD path might not be the right one for you if that's your main motivator. \n\nI'll say this, I was in my 20s when I went through the PhD. I love science, I love experiments and the failure and the discovery and the search for things. I don't think that, if I had instead done work or gotten a masters, that I would have been able to do a PhD in my 30s. Not to say you can't, but there's different motivators and factors that go into play here.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nmwhn6/phd_drama_should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/gzsznrx/"}, "3612": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TakeOffYourMask", "Date": 1622237950, "Score": 1, "Body": "You\u2019ve seen the movie right?

Average now for graduation according to Nature and other published literature for people in this field in the US is 6.5 - 6.7.years.   (it was less back then) and in my department, it's around 6-7 years.  I graduated in 6.7 years.  \n\nFor context: I am a young woman in STEM.  I graduated from college early which is how I graduated grad school at a young age, so I am also a bit younger than the average in my program. \n\nAdvice: \n\n1. Make sure your PI is actually interested and invested in your success.  I had a PI who was so absent but even then she placed priority on my two other colleagues instead of me and I had to get her attention any way how.  This significantly slowed down my progress.  You can imagine if your PI is checking in on you or asking your progress (without being too micromanaging or hovering), you will have less barriers to writing papers or getting resources or collobarators to get your research moving and I witnessed that. My colleagues had communication with collobarators and access to equipment, while I was left to fend for myself and figure things out about things that I shouldn't have to or can't because I was a graduate student and not a PI and even when I asked for help, she just didn't care.  It was frustrating and I wished I would have made that known but of course I didn't because she was my boss.  \n\n\n2. If you can avoid it, don't TA, unless you want that experience.  But otherwise don't do it.  It took way too much of my time away from research and after a few semesters it became prohibitive to my success.  So I would avoid it if possible and secure funding through an RA or some other way if you can.  I had to TA all 6 years of my graduate school years  and it took away from research because well, my PI didn't have much funding and the department was not supportive and with respect to number 1, when she did have funding to fund us for a summer, guess who she chose to fund? \n\n\n3. Have a project and then two side projects.  Don't just do little things for older grad students or post docs without at least having a MAIN project.  This is what my younger colleague is going through.  Our PI was so absent she never assigned him his own project and had him do a bit of everything for each of us older grad students.  However he never had like a MAIN project to tell a story for his thesis and so it wasn't until later in his fourth year that he finally got a main one.  Plus the side projects are good to have in case your main one doesn't work out.  Note, that in your career you will probably end up changing your project multiple times, so don't feel bummed if you had to drop one and move onto another.  In total, there are five of us in the lab and each of us have had to change our project at least once.  I had to change once and I changed it in my third year. \n\n\n4. Lol, this is more morally gray, but sometimes if you aren't getting the assistance and help and this happens, \"Ask for forgiveness, not for permission\".  You can make of that what you will.  \n\n\n5. Sometimes, I had to put on a facade.  Because of my age and how \"young\" I look, I have had people dismiss me and act like I don't know what I am talking about and it pisses me off.  I changed my tone and sometimes rehearse how to communicate things and that seemed to make people take me seriously.  My tone would be lower and I would sound more firm and give them a solid look when I spoke.  I will even question why they think that to force them to justify their thinking or why my model/theory w.e is invalid when I have solid evidence and then I watch them falter or fail because they didn't think they would have to justify themselves.  \n\n\n6. Get everything in email.  Dealing with a difficult PI, colleague etc.?  Get it in email and if you want, cc others.  They have to be careful how they communicate with you and may be a lot nicer to you.  I had to do this with one or two of them and when they realized they couldn't take advantage of me they backed off. \n\n\n7. Helping younger grad students or others in the lab?  I usually had a spectrum of this where some would need to be \"handheld\" and every little thing spelled out or they just need something quick.  It depends, but sometimes it can be mentally exhausting.  Instead, I would email some literature or papers and let them know where to start and then have them come to you for help for any specifics if they are the former type.  That way it's less taxing and it's not a drain because some might take advantage.  Of course, it depends upon what you are comfortable with.  I don't mind most times and am happy to help,, but then there are times where I think Google or a review could help.  \n\n\n8. Start your thesis as soon as possible.  Whatever amount of time you think you need, double that or triple that depending upon what you need to do.  Even if you are chipping a paragraph away like two years in advance, that's better than nothing because when you get to the end, you will be absolutely sick of it and don't even want to touch it afterwards. It's a lot easier to edit things already there, then to generate something out of thin air when it comes to writing.   \n\n\n9. Don't graduate in the summer if you can help it.  Do it in either Fall or Spring semester.  Professors are hard to gather, some are on sabbatical or vacation and the University might even charge you to graduate because you have to be registered in the summer.  Do it in the fall, winter or spring.  No summer.  \n\n\nThese are some of the glaring things.  If anybody has questions I am more than happy to go into detail, but I think this post is long enough lol.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nnpknz/current_and_past_phd_researchers_1_what_hurdles/gzwdvdq/"}, "3701": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Wishin4aTARDIS", "Date": 1622316239, "Score": 2, "Body": "My biggest hurdle was that my line of inquiry and eventual dissertation combined two areas, and therefore two people, who really didn't get along.

You are very close and everyone hits that slump or those goggles eventually come off at one point it another. \n\nMy experience: \n\nYour experience sounds a lot like mine in some respects.  I have my PhD in Biochemistry. My boss was hella absent and I barely saw her for weeks at a time and as a result the lab was a mess, equipment breaks down and is old and nothing works.  We went without lab meetings for one year.  Lack of resources didn't help either since ai had no way of doing shit on my own.  (I wasn't going to wait for her to finish.  I got good at reading papers and figuring experiments out for myself.  Even during my defense, she admitted to the committee and the public that a lot of what I did was self guided because she wasn't around). \n\nI used to also have a younger graduate student but rather than rushing she never actually followed through or committed to the planned experiments.  Part of was her fault but the other fault was definitely the lack of support from our department. She ended up graduating with a 5 year masters. \n\nI get that you are feeling discouraged and you are trying your best to really plough through, but I would focus on my research and cut out anything that doesn't have to do with advancing yourself towards your degree and future job prospects.  Everything else is ancillary and this is going to be especially important if you have a PI who isn't willing or doesn't seem that motivated or invested in helping you get there, because you are already working against the grain of no support so you really don't have much else to give anyone else.  I think you are so close and I don't think you should leave.  \n\nWhat kept me motivated was the fact, and this might sound unfair and bad, but looking around at other people who graduated, it was such b.s. how much less they got away with.  There were people in my program who graduated with barely anything.  There was even a stigma labeled against one of the graduate students who the professors said could probably talk his way into a PhD because he didn't seem to do any actual work.  It gave me some comfort and hope that okay, I am not a complete screw up or that I have wayyyyy more than enough. (I solved several crystal structures with drug inhibitors......so, I really wanted to see my professors try to fail me for that) \n\nIn any event, I think if you are still feeling unsure, to have a conversation with someone you can go to like another professor you trust.  I ended up talking to a member of my committee who is also the director of my program to express this to him.

Another thing that I eventually let go of was how people have tried to imbue into students  the philosophy of \"you will only learn if you have suffered as I have.\" No. If anything, this attitude is an incubator for mental health issues; reading about other students who have taken their lives because they felt trapped with nowhere else to go has been independent confirmation of this.\n\nI think one of the things that has helped, aside from being around for so long, is to know that other students and faculty are human beings who have their own issues surrounding these ideas. What has helped me to manage this is while I do have to work with people who perpetuate this mindset, I don't see their view as the reflection of some infallible academic who is all-knowing and sees my potential for what they think it is and what it will ever be; instead, I see them as another person trapped in this mindset, who unfortunately has been grinding things out for so long this way that their work flow becomes the only way they see things.

I'm fairly certain that he spent the rest of the week talking it over with lab mates individually, and that I was just the first person he talked with about it.  A secondary reason is because it isn't official yet, and he doesn't want the department to hear about it from someone other than him.

I was further along in my degree, but similar to you, I didn't have anything personal that was tying me down to the first place, and I honestly felt that staying and joining a different lab would be a bigger but worse change in terms of my thesis progress. I also found a \"fresh start\" appealing. I chose to move with my supervisor, while another graduate student chose to stay. I'd say we both experienced some delays in our degrees - for the other student, it was having to start in a new lab (btw he didn't have to start from scratch, just shifted gears a bit to make his work more relevant to his new lab). For me, it was a combination of setting up a new lab (optimizing protocols, re-deriving mouse lines, completing safety and equipment training at new institute etc) and complications with customs when shipping our stuff. This took several months, although it might be different for your lab. However, I believe I made the right choice because our new lab had much better facilities &amp; research support and we had way more funding. I did prefer the first city, but I'm pretty adaptable so that wasn't a huge deal. I saw you mention you will still be getting the same degree from the first school (I did as well), so if you still have course credits to complete, I'd find out how you can do that at another university. Hopefully your supervisor also negotiated relocation costs for all his lab members, so that your move and any fees with breaking your lease will be covered. I was provided a generous lump sum, which ended up covering the fee for breaking my lease, my flight, sending some stuff by Fedex, and even new furniture.
