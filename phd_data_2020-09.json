There was a mathematics student in our College who worked closely with a marine micro-ecology lab and came up with papers that they submitted to Nature. Her mathematics skills were really important for modelling marine ecological and environmental conditions and helped a lot with complex datasets and variables.\n\nEcology is very heavy on multivariate statistics, biostatistics and nowadays, modelling/programming. This surprises people coming into ecology, but when you work with nature and multiple variables over numerous spatial and temporal scales, then the maths gets pretty intense! Many people come into ecology thinking it's fun times in nature only and basic statistics. It is the opposite. \n\nA skillset such as yours is used a lot by ecological modellers - think population biology/community ecology. I know fisheries and agriculture are huge employers of those with mathematics and modelling capabilities, but do be aware it's a hugely competitive job market and it can take a long while to reach a fulltime position. Ecology PhDs are often hired by environmental consultants, Government (think technical/research/policy officers), conservation/NGOs, National parks, natural resource management. Ecology is not the fastest publishing field and I feel that academic jobs are few and far between, even with a strong maths component. And usually the less field-based (i.e. \"fun\") the ecology job, the more it pays. \n\nThe other aspect to consider is if you choose to do a field-based ecology PhD or not. Not all ecologists work in the field, but many do. However, field work will massively push up your grant costs, and will take *a lot* of time. Ecology is benefited from long-term or spatially large studies in nature. It's tough to achieve in a PhD, but doable. Be prepared for everything and anything to go wrong! Nature will often not comply or meet your research expectations due to huge datasets with lots of variables that take a lot of work to make any sense of. If there's a field component, there's usually a lab component; Covid may make field and lab work trickier.\n\nStipends are dependent on your country, your University and so on. I'm in Australia and got a top-up scholarship that paid my living wages for 3.5 years ($32K AUD p/y instead of $27K), but that wasn't because I was in ecology and was moreso to do with my grades at the time of applying. I'm not too sure how Masters/credits work so someone else will have to comment on that. Ecology grants/stipends are more successful for projects that tackle the \"big ecological issues.\" That is, ecology PhDs are less about the theoretical components nowadays (par a few), and more about practicality. Think climate change, invasive species, ecological shifts, conservation etc. But again - mathematics and modelling comes in handy for this too, climate change/ecological shifts especially.\n\nOverall, if you did an ecology PhD and discovered afterwards the field isn't for you, I think your mathematics background would still be useful in any discipline and many jobs. Ecology is a fun research field, but its variability and lack of control in what data you get can be hugely stressful. PhDs themselves are large investments of one's time, among other things, and there's no guarantee that a PhD will give you a job as a professor or anything else, ecology/maths background or not.\n\n**Td,dr: Ecology is very statistics heavy, and mathematics backgrounds are beneficial in ecological research/jobs and often sought after. However, ecology careers are competitive with or without a maths background.**", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ikw6an/whats_a_phd_in_ecology_or_zoology_like/g3nygxg/"}, "134": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "allostaticholon", "Date": 1599008577, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thanks, I'll take a look!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/iknbe2/natural_science_phd_programs_for_people_without_a/g3o028r/"}, "135": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "iampsk98", "Date": 1599015460, "Score": 1, "Body": "That\u2019s a relief, thank you!\ud83d\ude05", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ijbjiu/do_i_need_to_retake_gre/g3ocsc8/"}, "136": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "HungoverHippy42", "Date": 1599017592, "Score": -1, "Body": "Just wait till you take a class featuring material that completely inverts your research design.

So, what i feel reading you is that you are trapped in the mechanical part of all, which sucks, because is the darkest part of the academic life.   \n\n\nI believe that first you have to do therapy, like a psichologist, not because you are in a unstable state of mind, because you need someone who listen to you in a very objective way and you feel that there is no way that he gonna judge you about your decisions. In that line, try a journal, write about your study, what you like about what you are doing, what you don't like, put your thoughts in words, which will help you to understand what is going on with you and by keeping track on your study will give your perspective of are you or are you not making progress.  \n\n\nAs many said, travel.

The struggle is with validating the feelings because no one else is around to help --which is very much why there's a lot of traffic on this reddit sub right now. The most complex part of this situation is the illusion of flexibility. We can work at home fine when it's a choice. But we can't when the decision is made for us. A lack of physical freedom and the feeling of restraint greatly impacts our ability to draw upon creativity. Sure our work time appears to be flexible, but it's really not. Covid destroys our healthy boundaries to separate home/leisure from work.

Thus, it is important to remember the big picture and begin viewing your advisor and committee members as your academic colleagues rather than authority figures. \n\nYour defense is an opportunity to show your committee that you are leaving any graduate student meekness behind and that you are capable of respectfully pushing back.

In a high-stress situation, it can be difficult to remember the nuances that will ultimately result in a stronger dissertation.\n\n* Send your advisor an outline of your presentation.

I think that mentality perhaps also limited my capability as a researcher as well (It's hard to think creatively if all I am doing is to avoid danger). But I also realized that I didn't want to do graduate school for THAT reason. I wanted to actually choose the path if I wanted to. I took leaps of faith (so scary) to do it and just give it a shot and now I am finally graduated.. yay.. I would perhaps recommend you not making decisions out of fear.

The panic and anxiety about *everything* were paralysing me, which just made everything much worse.\n\nIn the end what helped me was to talk with my internal examiner (technically I wasn't supposed to but in my case my supervisor couldn't help me so I had no choice) and that helped me understand that minor corrections are meant to be doable in 1 month, so I should take that into account when interpreting my tasks. Also, if something is impossible you can say so in your response (I had to write a document addressing each task and how/where I make alterations to my thesis) and write a sentence or paragraph addressing it in your thesis.\n\nThe other thing that helped was to limit things. I had to read a lot of literature for my corrections, and it made me question parts of my discussion (and introduction, and pretty much everything, really). I had to keep remind myself to only do what I was asked to a point where it would be acceptable and no more. And also that science never stops, and a thesis is always an incomplete work.\n\nI hope this makes sense. Basically, what helped me was to make sure to interpret everything through the \"this should only take 1 month\" argument.\n\nI'd suggest talking to your supervisor about this.

He submitted a paper in ISCA 2019 (one of the most prominent conference in computer architecture) which was accepted. This paper had several issues but eventually it went through (according to his suicide note, due to his advisor's influence). After the acceptance, he did some experiments which showed that the paper was flawed. His advisor insisted on presenting the paper. Confronted between academic integrity and his relationship with the advisor, he chose death. A medium post was made about this by one of his friends using an anonymous account [Details are here] (https://medium.com/@huixiangvoice/the-hidden-story-behind-the-suicide-phd-candidate-huixiang-chen-236cd39f79d3)\n\n&gt;What interested me really is how the things went afterwards.

I also did an MBA and an MSc before that. \n\nYou didn't tell the country you have in mind, so things can be different. My answer is assuming US.\n\nMBA and PhD are very different from each other. \n\nYou do an MBA if you want to follow a career in industry, you will take many courses, network with other people, and hopefully get involved with some companies along the way. It's not so different from a bachelor's degree, but it's more advanced. \n\nYou do a PhD is you want to become a professor, a researcher. You will take some courses, but that's not the important part of it. You will learn to do academic research, and you will learn that by doing it, not by taking courses. A PhD is like a job, where you do your research, you help other professors with their research, and also help the university in other ways (e.g., teaching classes, grading exams, organizing events). This is a job, and usually a very hard one. I'm doing this after a 20-years career, an MBA, a MSc, so I'm not inexperienced, but this is very, very hard. It's also very rewarding, because I learn and grow like crazy. But don't underestimate a PhD program if you want to do well. \n\nSince a PhD is like a job, you get paid for it. Any decent PhD program in business in the US will provide tuition waivers and stipends to the students. This will probably take 4 to 6 years. You're paid, but not that much. And you are focused on academic research. So, if you don't want to be a professor or a researcher, a PhD is probably not a good idea. It's usually better to work for a company for 4 to 6 years to get relevant experience in the corporate world, get a better salary, get promoted, etc.\n\nSo, I did an MBA when I was following a corporate career, that made sense for my career at that time.

They're from a similar culture where you just kind of suck it up and keep going or you die. Success is way more important than happiness to them. This is where the \"mastering out\" comes in-- when I leave, I should theoretically have a MA. They were already aware I did not want to stay in academia, so I attempted to explain that taking a MA that the university paid for would allow me (statistically) the best odds for starting my career and making the maximum amount of money (*eye roll*). They are still not exactly happy, but they'll be a lot happier if I get a decent job when I leave.\n\nThat's also something that will help-- having something \"better\" that gives you a reason to quit beyond your own misery.

Some days work sucks and you don't have the mental energy or capacity to read/write. Some nights are for shitty television. \n* Be consistent. Try to do at least one small thing each day. It's unlikely you'll write XXX words everyday. But you can do something. Read one article. Type up some notes. Review language vocab (I have German, Greek, Hebrew to keep up with). Edit a chapter. Find something meaningful to keep you engaged.\n* Be honest with your advisor about expectations. I am fortunate to have an advisor that understands my situation and reminds me that I'm part-time and family comes before scholarship. Work with your advisor to set reasonable expectations. \n* Present/submit papers to conferences. Since I work in another field full-time, I often don't have the confidence in my work that others do. My advisor pushed me and I've presented at multiple conferences, including the most important in my field, and even won some prizes for best student paper.

These conferences have kept me connected to the field and allowed me to make friends and meet others with similar interests. \n* Let your partner and close friends know how to support you.

They all chose proper certification from a specialised qualifications board that aren't cheap and take multiple months (full-time) to get. There are different ones in Germany and you can find out in job options which ones are most thought after (although as long as it's a proper certificate they might honour it, too).  \nThe paths were PR (through additional studies at a University), quality assurance, project management and data management (multiple months course), medical writing (she got lucky, her company trained her extensively) and of course consulting.  \nThe downside is that they are also no guarantee, especially now during this pandemic it's hard to get a good job, as some companies have hiring freezes and they often no longer accept applications that don't aim at a specific job opening.  \n\nI would say your first step should be identifying in which direction you want to go. Check all job websites you know if got jobs and maybe even apply to some, even if it's not a perfect fit. Job openings always describe the ideal candidate, not what they might also settle for. Hard requirements are often hard to pass, but everything that \"would be a plus\" you can safely ignore and \"years of experience\" are often exaggerated, although by how much of course differs by company (so if they want one, they might also accept zero, if they want five they will accept less than five but often no newbies).  \nUse your degree but also skills and more generic keywords to find jobs (so \"developmental biology\", \"biology\", \"STEM\" or \"microscopy\", \"genetics\", ...). Don't be shy to try synonyms, companies prefer different language.  \nIf you are completely clueless it can also be worth it to just enter your region (or a region you might want to work in) and check all jobs, just to see what's there. Sometimes you will spot something you haven't thought of, yet.  \nAlso check company websites directly, if there is a company that interests you. I didn't find my job though any job website but because I was lucky enough to check the company website at the right time. Also check different job websites, not all jobs are available everywhere. You don't have to check all sites daily but maybe one per day and rotate.\n\nOnce you saw a lot of openings and probably had a few first interviews, you will develop an idea what you want to do. At first, I though consulting might be for me but after attending an information day of a consulting firm where I could ask all my questions I realized that I don't really see myself there.  \nOnce you have that idea, you can check if there is maybe something you can do to strengthen your profile in that direction.

Mine actually went really swimmingly, and was actually disappointed by how short it was.\n\nI was fortunately furloughed so only had to focus on my PhD/job searching.\n\nWhat I found that helped for me was I read through my entire thesis from beginning to end (I had a couple of published papers that I hadn't looked at in forever). I recorded myself reading it out loud (never once listened to them, but it helped the process I think). This was really helpful as it actually allows you to read through, rather than the skimming you would normally do. I made short one page notes of each chapter (Aim, Purpose, Method, Results, Relevance, Stats, weaknesses, strengths).\n\nI then went through each chapter and went ok let's create a list of questions. For every chapter I had the following three questions by default\n\n1.\tWhat was the purpose of chapter 2?\n2.\tWhat would you do differently in chapter 2?\n3.\tWhat does chapter 2 contribute to the wider literature?\n\nI then also went through, and with every methodology, statistical, or theoretical decision I asked why did I do this. Here's a list I had for one of my chapters.\n\n1.\tWhat was the purpose of chapter 6?\n2.\tWhat would you do differently in chapter 6?\n3.\tWhat does chapter 6 contribute to the wider literature?\n4.\tWhy did you choose to extend your replication into the UK and Australia?\n5.\tWhy was the unbalanced design and violations to normality and homogeneity not an issue?\n6.\tWhy did you not examine how education interacted with question wording?\n7.\tWhy might you not have replicated the original finding?\n8.\tWhy did you choose to do a direct replication of this study and not the later replications Schuldt and colleagues had done on their own work?\n9.\tIf socio-temporal changes did account for the differences in findings what is the relevance of your findings, and for how long would they remain relevant?\n10.\tDo you think there were any downsides to pre-filtering participants to get a balanced number of left- and right-wing participants?\n11.\tMight you have excluded more moderate people when doing so?\n\n\nNow obviously most of those won't be relevant for you. But it helps get the idea.\n\nThe creation of the questions helps probably the most, as it's putting you in the shoes of what your examiner will be doing. The important thing here is to not shy away from hard questions. Your examiner won't so don't short change yourself.

Be critical of your work (you know the weaknesses, don't shy from them)\n2. Create short summaries\n3. Practice writing/answering questions\n4. You've done the hardest part of the PhD already.

Almost replaceable if not for some libraries. Maybe you can start with using python for your work and take a course on Python online. From what you describe you can look into gaming and simulation industries that work with building physics engines and simulators. Eg. Unreal and Unity are notable mentions.

Scotty-style time management. I took this from an episode of TNG, always overrepresent how long it will take to do something. Even if you know it'll take 1 day to finish, give yourself a week. That way you can take longer and it'll still be ok. You can also finish crazy early and be a wunderkind. \n\n2. Underreport what gets done. For my update meetings, I only talk about things that are more important to be addressed sooner rather than later. Even if I did something that will be relevant a month from now, I don't say anything. That way I basically always have something to report.\n\n3. Always have a backup thing to report. In the event nothing gets done for like two months (it happens). I always keep something in my back pocket to report, it might be small and largely insignificant, but that's nothing that some flowery language can't fix.\n\n4. Split up things into little things. If I can only report something small, I basically report all the little steps. That way it seems like I'm doing more than I'm not.\n\n5. Report something didn't work. Negative results are great, because you don't generally have evidence that something didn't work. That way you still look like you're getting word done despite not having done anything.\n\nThe difference with a PhD vs industry is that if I get nothing done in my PhD, I'm mostly just hurting myself.

I hope someone can correct me if I write anything wrong. \n\n1 - If your goal is really teaching, maybe a PhD is not the best way to go. PhD programs are focused on research, and you don't need a PhD to teach. \n\n2 - You mentioned some background information that is usually not relevant for PhD applications (military veteran), and left out some very important parts (research experience, letters of recommendation, what courses you have taken related to quantitative stuff like calculus, algebra, econometrics, etc.). PhDs related to finance and economics are heavily quantitative. \n\n3 - Things like personal finance and bankruptcy are more like broad topics of research that several types of PhD can study. PhD programs in Finance, Economics, Accounting, Psychology, Public Policy, among others can study that, with different perspectives. You don't need to find a PhD in personal finance or a PhD in bankruptcy. I'm doing a PhD in Marketing, and there are people here doing research that is related to personal finance, for example. \n\n4 - If a university in another country is highly regarded in the field (e.g., INSEAD, London Business School), then US universities probably wouldn't have much of a problem hiring you. But there are many more US universities that are highly regarded for this kind of research than abroad. If you want to work in the US, it's usually better to do a PhD in the US. \n\n5 - For any decent PhD program in business-related fields, you should expect to get full financial aid (e.g., tuition waiver, stipend) and work as a teaching assistant or research assistant. Having to pay instead of getting paid is usually a red flag, at least for business schools.

Again, it's not your problem so long as there's no intellectual theft to fear. He shouldn't go around quoting from it but I wouldn't tell him that because it's so obvious and such a basic part of good citation practices and academic ethics that he might feel insulted when this is pointed out to him.

Since he can't refer to it - aside from acknowledging in a footnote that he's aware of your PhD project, which he can refer to by the information that's publically available, e.g. on the pages of your grad school -, sharing the manuscript privately can't hurt your chances to get published.

The depression, especially when a lot of your internal self worth is based on the idea of feeling intelligent and capable, and physically seeing progress of your own growth and learning, when that stops it creates a spiral of negative thoughts.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t I making any progress? Why can\u2019t you just read one thing? Why can\u2019t you just go outside? Are you even smart at all? And the answer in your head is always because you\u2019re the worst. You\u2019re lazy, you\u2019re dumb, you don\u2019t deserve anything you have because you can\u2019t even see how lucky you are.\n\nHe lies to everyone because he is not doing well. And the mind is looking for any reason to agree with your negative thoughts. The fear is that if he\u2019s honest, they\u2019ll agree with his worst image of himself which is you don\u2019t deserve anything. \n\nIt\u2019s a very good thing he\u2019s in therapy and on meds. But sometimes therapy isn\u2019t enough. Sometimes a person can tell you over and over that your thoughts aren\u2019t reality, but who are you going to believe? A therapist that doesn\u2019t really know you or your own voice that has been there for years. He may need to change his medication; you build a tolerance to antidepressants.\n\nI don\u2019t know if quitting or not quitting the Ph.D. Is the right choice for him. I know for a fact that quitting will be the hardest thing he will have ever done. But with the volatility of possibly changing antidepressants and his current emotions, having a deadline where everything hangs in the balance will not be good. It won\u2019t be good for his mental health and it won\u2019t be good for his work.\n\nYou need to try and approach it not from a place or I\u2019m trying to fix it or I\u2019m trying to help you, but one of I\u2019m here for the long haul. Because recovering from depression is a long road and he knows that. He\u2019s probably feeling guilty because this isn\u2019t the life you signed up for. But it isn\u2019t the life he signed up for either. You also point blankly need to ask him if he\u2019s been having suicidal thoughts. If he keeps sliding things under the radar to friends and family he is probably sliding even darker things past you. \n\nThe best advice I can give is be calm. Be supportive. Be open. Start with little pieces of calm and joy in his daily life that have nothing to do with the PH.D. and his emotions. Ask him to go on short walks around the block. Get some sunshine on his skin. Make his favorite dessert. Play a video game with him if he likes them. Hold his hand. Tiny things that build his confidence, his comfort level so his nervous system can regulate. And make sure you\u2019re taking care of yourself so you can help him take care of himself.

Some programs make exceptions for milestone/PhD completion deadlines. (The ADA may help here, legally, by the way.) There are deadlines and paperwork, of course, for requesting these types of extensions. When one is depressed, administrative details (and the motivation to address them) slip away as easily as a sneaky spider in your bathroom you take your eyes off for a moment to find a broom. I don\u2019t mean to imply you are responsible for this or if your partner would take it well, so please take all I say as an approach that can be helpful for helping some people with depression, not an assertion or moral claim about what you should do. \n\nIf you think your partner might be open to the support, consider reading his program, department, graduate school, and/or university (as these often differ) student and/or graduate employee handbooks and compiling information about relevant policies. Removing small barriers can do wonders for people with depression. For instance, if there\u2019s a form to mail, if you print it out, address the envelope, append the stamp, and hand it to him, that could make the difference in whether or not he even pursues an extension. The steps you\u2019ve taken care of in this hypothetical may seem trivial, but everything and anything can feel overwhelming for depressed people \u2014 because depression compromises reward systems, even life-shattering stakes may not motivate one to go buy a stamp. One large task can be manageable where many small ones are not. \n\nFor just a couple general remarks: It sounds like you\u2019re putting a lot of effort into being compassionate and non-judgmental. That is a commendable and effective approach. People are often more receptive to help when they know that others still see them as intrinsically competent, worthwhile people who just can\u2019t be at their best right now because of an illness. (He likely doesn\u2019t see himself that way; he likely doesn\u2019t treat himself with the same compassion you do.) You also may consider seeking counsel for yourself.

I'll say \"but I should have...\" \"But what if...?\" And he will say \"no, you did xxx, xxx, and xxx. You're amazing. You're doing so great.\" Even if it's dumb stuff like return internet orders, or call my grandparents.\n\n-He has made me promise that if I'm stuck I'll tell him. I get stuck a lot in shame spirals, and kind of lay in bed for days. But a week or so ago, I did tell him. I just said \"I need you right now, I'm stuck\", and he came and sat by me, and said \"okay, what is stressing you out the most right now?\". And it was an email that was making me feel a lot of shame. So he was like \"come on, let's open it together\". And we opened it together, and I cried openly like a child because of fear, and then we read it, and he made me respond. He just sat there until we did it. And then, he said \"that's not so bad was it?\", And then he came and sat really close to me on the couch and let me sob feebly while I did stuff that scared me. I just decided to accept the negative emotion, and ride it, and do the scary thing anyway. And he sits with me, and we let the negative emotions happen, and he works on other stuff, and I am reminded that it's okay.\n\n-but I keep falling off the wagon again. So he keeps checking in again. And again, and again and again. Because I don't always ask when I need help, because I'm too ashamed.\n\n-today, he helped me plan out my thesis. He made me tell him the parts, then he wrote them on post it's and stuck them to the wall. And we broke it down into little chunks, teeny tiny chunks, and estimated how long each one would take. And then we agreed on a deadline, and he said \"pick on and do it before you go home\". And ... I did.\n\nOverall, I think that for me, the issue is that I'm a smart, capable human. But when I'm feeling anxious, it's like having a million chrome tabs open. It just doesn't leave any room in my brain for anything else. And 20% of my attention isn't enough to succeed in grad school. So I was failing at my thesis. Repeatedly. And then I felt shame, which was triggered by the work. And then I got stuck. \n\nSo he has lent me some of his brain space, and taken a lot of the work out of it for me, by helping me with planning (just keep asking questions, to break it down into chunks), getting started (badgering me until I do it, making me close tabs), battling anxiety (sitting and being there in it with me), and celebrating my successes (I've been so trapped in grad school, all I could see was the failures, which made every day feel horrible).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/itcdvx/relationship_and_phd/g5fznwv/"}, "1644": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Meit_", "Date": 1600234210, "Score": 1, "Body": "Haha", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/itj8ys/ai_nobody_talks_about_me/g5g15xq/"}, "1645": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ihopeshelovedme", "Date": 1600234678, "Score": 1, "Body": "What does a biomechanist's work look like?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i0mtzd/cries_in_phd/g5g1qra/"}, "1646": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ihopeshelovedme", "Date": 1600234762, "Score": 2, "Body": "What does the term \"bioengineer\" encompass?

I don\u2019t know the education field at all and I see you\u2019re already trying to collect new data but struggling.

The most important parts are planning, drafting, and revising. I categorize four different kinds of writers: 1) heavy planners. Spend a lot of time planning and organizing content before drafting. Less time in revision. 2) heavy revisers. Basic planning, then most time revising. 3) equal. Don\u2019t prioritize any part of process. 4) do it all at once.

Ignore how it sounds, spelling, etc.  when you start paying attention to those lower level pieces, you break your idea flow. \n\nEditing should be done LAST, after all revisions have been made. Revision focuses on larger concepts like organization, coherence, transitions, flow, etc. Editing focuses on low level aspects like sentence structure, spelling, word choice, etc.  \n\nI am a heavy reviser and hate to plan.

The hardest part for you may be letters of recommendation (schools usually like to see one professor, but not required, and I don\u2019t know if you are still in contact with any).Now you are probably not going to get into CalTech/MIT/etc, but you should still be able to find a decent group. Having a career in academia (tenured professor) is a different story.\n\nWhy should you get a PhD? Do it because you want to and want to learn a lot about a very particular problem. Ask yourself \u201cDo I want to spend several years working on the same problem?\u201d\n\nSome other things to consider:\n\n1) Have an idea of where you want to end up when you graduate (industry, national lab, academia, etc), and look for groups that send their former members on those paths. Right now the people doing molecular situations are mostly in academia and/or national labs. Industry is starting to get more involved (especially with material science and pharma).\n\n2) The PhD stipend will probably be a big payout (you will likely make at most $35k/year), and may require a move to attend the school. Odds are you SO will probably need to find a job to help with bills (so if you move, make sure there are opportunities for them), or have a decent amount saved up.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/iu85oq/applying_for_phd_in_chemical_engineering_without/g5j7ixj/"}, "1736": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "rhett21", "Date": 1600304200, "Score": 1, "Body": "Hello, this answer just encouraged me to prepare more to get into PhD :( can I send you a DM?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/iu85oq/applying_for_phd_in_chemical_engineering_without/g5j8i33/"}, "1737": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jpc4zd", "Date": 1600304337, "Score": 1, "Body": "Sure.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/iu85oq/applying_for_phd_in_chemical_engineering_without/g5j8qxt/"}, "1738": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Boneified_PhD", "Date": 1600304389, "Score": 2, "Body": "I would read through the comments first to get an idea of what needed to be done, take a break after reading them to breath, and then create my unofficial response.

I just went through this with a first year student getting ready to rotate and even after telling him anything and everything he is still interested. \n\nWith that all in mind some good questions about the lab and PI could be: \n\n1. What is the management style of the PI, hands off, hands on, somewhere in the middle?  I didn't join a lab because the PI is extremely hands off and I wanted to be able to meet with my PI if I needed to but I also wanted independence.  Also, how good is the PI about reading documents and manuscripts and giving feedback.\n2. Work hour expectations.  Does the PI expect you to be around during work hours (9-6ish), work weekends, work late, etc...\n3. Funding, this can be super important.  If you join the lab will you be funded for the amount of time it is going to take you to graduate? Is this through RA or TA?  \n4. Do grad students in the lab get along well, not necessarily best friends but are they at least civil to each other.  \n5. Will you have the opportunity to (or will you be required to) take on undergraduate students. \n6. Do the students typically have the materials and access to equipment they need to do their research?\n\nI would also recommend getting some general info on your department and school\n\n1. Will you have to TA? For how many semesters? How many hours per week do you have to commit?\n2. What does the school and department offer the students? IE... health insurance, guaranteed funding through TA for x amount of time (mine guarantees 5 years of funding through TA, the student I recently spoke with didn't know this and thought he had to find funding), parking, etc\n3. Any info you may like about on campus recreation, food, health services, etc\n4. Ask about the stipend (I saw you mention this in another comment).  Just do it.  You need to know how much you are going to make to determine if you can financially afford to attend.  If this isn't a concern, great, but it sounds like it may be for you.  Some students ultimately choose their program from their stipend offerings.  \n\nAlso ask about the community, living expenses, recreation, safety and crime.  Being a graduate student is so much different than being an undergrad, I am much less entwinned with the undergraduate community and feel more like a resident of my city rather than a student.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/iv6zg9/scored_a_phone_convo_with_phd_student_working/g5qcq5t/"}, "1879": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CR_224", "Date": 1600457328, "Score": 1, "Body": "+1 on this, you should be getting way more than \u00a310k if you're UK national", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/iv9ssi/question_about_phd_funding_uk/g5qeyzy/"}, "1880": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "trisheyyx3", "Date": 1600457421, "Score": 3, "Body": "You're right.

Here\u2019s my two cents.\n1. Funding: There is nothing wrong in asking this question. Especially if you\u2019re moving to a new place. You can word it as \u2018Is the stipend enough to cover expenses + a little fun/travel/hobby expenses based on the cost of living of the area?\u2019 This is very open ended and based on the response you can prove further about roughly how much percent of stipend to the grad students in that area spend on housing + essentials etc. This will give you a good idea without asking for a specific number amount.\n\n1.b. Source of funding - clarify if stipend is based on RAship or TAship.\n\n2. Work environment: Your PI is an important figure in your PhD life but I think the lab culture and environment is more important, especially if you\u2019re in a heavily experimental field. You\u2019ll often spend more time in a week with your lab mates that your flatmates. So ask how the working environment is? Are people supportive and friendly? Do people engage in discussions outside of lab meetings etc. \n\n3. Work/Life balance: What do students do in that area? Do they have the time or opportunity to do activities outside of lab? This need not be about leisure or entertainment. It can include leadership opportunities, workshops, outreach in the community etc. Try to get an idea of doing a PhD here means 80 hours a week of lab or does it have scope for you to enjoy and grow as a person too.\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of right now. \nAll the best!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/iv6zg9/scored_a_phone_convo_with_phd_student_working/g5qf8vy/"}, "1882": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Ooblackbird", "Date": 1600457491, "Score": 1, "Body": "Every professor is different, but definitely expect questions about your personality, and maybe some research ethics.

A lot of the milestones setup for Phd students in humanities are geared towards producing specialized knowledge and appealing to now non-existent positions on the academic job market.Look up \"academic job market\" on Twitter and see all the discussion people are having there.\n\nNow in the midst of COVID, students who know they probably won't get a tenure-track job are talking about teaching in high schools and community colleges or working in museums.

However, even positive experiences tend to be hard and lead to growth (so, changes are expected), and it's very hard to know whether it will be a positive experience or not.

In the long run, you will still be super happy with life without a doctorate? Is your goal of becoming a biologist and getting a doctorate reason enough to risk the happy life you have now?\n\nBecause it's not realistic for me to tell you go ahead, you won't change, and you will have an amazing experience.

Very, very toxic. It was designed to propagate inequality and replicate privilege. Part of the way it constantly filters folks out officially is through the 20k hoops you have to jump through to graduate. \n\nUnofficially, it is by making folks feel like shit. The whole \"rite of passage\" narrative is another form of toxicity. It shouldn't be normal that folks experience depression and anxiety. Suicidal ideation shouldn't be a relatively common thing.p\n\nIt is worse for folks who academia was designed to keep out. For me, I feel like I am marginalized in so many different ways that the odds of me being here are pretty much astronomically bad-- that doesn't say how amazing I am, but how shitty they are.\n\nThere are a few things that I realized that really helped me make it through:\n\n1. I feel like I am not supposed to be here because I am not supposed to be here. This place was designed to keep me out of it. It is designed to be uncomfortable, so if somebody like me manages to in, they leave of their own accord. This has nothing to do with me, and everything to do with them.\n\n2. My consequences of \"failure\" are pretty low. If I don't get a job or drop out of my program or whatever, my life is likely to be better. Odds are, I will do less work for more money with less stress. My life would improve dramatically if I wasn't here. In fact, I'd probably live longer without the toxic stress. They'd actually be doing me a favor, tbh. Win-win.\n\n3. Scholar is not who I am, it is what I do for a living. I had a life before I came here. I will have one after I leave. Truly, I have one outside of my work now. This is a job. Jobs come and go.\n\nLast spring  I met with a professor whose research had connections to mine. She asked me about my \"scholarly identity.\" I said that I don't really feel like I have one and proceeded to talk about the things that I am interested in. She responded that perhaps after I complete X milestone in my program, I'll have a better answer.\n\nThis whole situation is hella f*cked up. First, scholar isn't my identity-- it is my job. The identity narrative, the expectation that my identity would be tied up in my job is hella toxic.\n\nAnd the fact that you can literally look me in the face and tell me my identity isn't good enough, is like... Like you've got to be kidding me. You don't get to evaluate my identity. Who does that? Who thinks that that is a perfectly acceptable thing to do? It is sooooo problematic, to the extent of being laughable. \n\nPerhaps that is the last thing.\n\n4. I learned to laugh at these folks. The utter gall and nerve of these folks. \n\nI also don't hold back. In my writing and in my speaking I am highly critical of the toxicity and elitism and sexism and classism and racism that are the foundations of this educational system, that pervade every facet of it. \n\nYou aren't alone.

Like many have said, I don't think a graduate degree is necessary at most universities to get into a PhD program.  Heck, I know two people who didn't even have undergraduate degrees, but went into PhD programs and finished.\n\nOne was an exceptional case of a friend of mine who was a math prodigy.  He finished high school in the US a couple years early and then took some math classes at a local university.  By the time he was 18, he had taken every undergraduate math course available but he didn't do any other university requirements to receive a BSc.  He took the subject and general GREs then just applied for PhD programs and got into a few.  All in all, he only had like 50-60 US credit hours of higher education (all math) before he started his dissertation.  A standard BSc. degree in the US is 120 credit hours and MSc is typically another 45 on top of that.\n\nThe second was a friend of mine who is now an economist in the UK.  He grew up in Scotland, did A levels in Maths and Economics then moved to the US due to family reasons.  He didn't finish school, just started working as an insurance salesman.  He took actuarial exams to become an actuary at his company and got his credentials after a few years (they don't require a degree, evidently).  HR eventually moved him to the actuarial department after he got his credentials.  Quite a few years later, he returned to the UK and got a PhD even though he had only ever finished A levels over a decade before.  I guess being an actuary for about a decade was enough to get into a PhD program for economics.\n\nI think the most important thing you need to do is convince the right people (admissions, potential advisors, dean, etc...) that you will be a solid researcher and that you won't require much, if any remedial coursework to enter the program along with any other incoming students.\n\nI think it is much the same as if you're just hiring somebody for any job: I care if you can do the job I'm hiring you to do, not if you have a piece of paper that some organization gave you.

I started my PhD this Fall and all of my original GA work (high school outreach sports med) has been cut, and they even tried to drop my contract and I was worried about dropping out (it was a whole ordeal). So my situation has been very tenuous and I often found myself strung out or struggling to stay motivated. \n\nHonestly though, the thing that is getting me through is that I started blocking time to not do school work. That way every time I do sit at my computer, I feel fresh and I can hit it hard. It's difficult to say, \"let's take a walk for 15 minutes\" when you have a lot to do. But when you consider how much time you waste when you're not fully engaged, that can be way more than 15 minutes. \n\nMy daily schedule looks kind of like this:\n\n5:30/6:00 AM-7:00 get up and casually read while everything is quiet. \n7-7:30 exercise. Either a jog or a yoga session online. \n7:30-8:30 breakfast, shower, write a checklist of today's tasks (important)\n8:30- lunch: school work/GA work\nAfter lunch to dinner: more school work/GA work,\nAfter dinner to 10: hang out with roommates, read, study, tie up the day. \n10:00/10:30 in bed, no exceptions\n\nWhile this isn't always realistic, having a regular sleep schedule, being flexible but committed to your daily schedule, and always making time for some form of exercise and self care will never fail you. \n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint. Adopt your healthy habits now and set the precedent that you're a disciplined and somewhat balanced person. \n\nAnd cut out the social media. That shit is toxic and you can sink hours of useless browsing into them (like reddit). Turn off notifications, basically remove any opportunities for distraction. \n\nAs for my own experience, I was diagnosed with ADHD in my Master's. Adderall was terrible so I found a way to just suck it up and treat myself better. I learned this stuff after making many mistakes and this is the only way I've stayed afloat since then. \n\nBeing a grad student doesn't mean you need to be a recluse subsisting entirely on cup ramen and caffeine (while I do enjoy a single coffee in the afternoon). The bottom line is that all of your body needs to be treated well for your brain to work.

The market for professors isn't growing like it was years ago.  Not as many people were going to college a couple generations ago and then there was a huge boom.  Now a college degree is almost as ubiquitous as a high school diploma used to be.  So there was a huge growth in universities and also professorships.  Now, given tenure and no-forced-retirement, professors stay in the jobs for a long time without much movement.  Think about how many students your advisor has advised and will have advised before they retire.  How many is that?  20?  Now how many jobs will be available when they retire?  Probably 1.3 or so at best due to population growth and demand for higher education.  Chances are you won't be working in academia even if you want to be, at least not in a tenure track position.\n\nA friend of mine, who is a professional trumpet player was talking to me about how similar professional symphonies / the audition scene are to the post-doc game that I and some friends in our social group have talked about.  There are literally 100+ trumpeters that will send resumes to audition when there is an opening at a major city symphony.  There are typically 2 to 4 full-time trumpeters in a symphony due to how many trumpets are in the majority of the repertoire of an average symphony.  Lets say an average trumpeter lands a gig and stays there for 30 years.  Any given symphony is going to have to replace a trumpeter once a decade, again round numbers averaging.  How many major symphonies are there in the US?  100?  (round numbers again).  So yeah 10 jobs a year in the US for trumpeters is what my friend was saying ... with hundreds of trumpeters who graduated with degrees at Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral levels in performance.  He has told me that for years and years he saw the same faces at auditions and you gradually see fewer and fewer, replaced by new faces ... most aren't getting jobs at a symphony ... most are taking that entry-level management job that their father-in-law got them because it's time to settle down and start a family.  They're going back to school to get their teaching license and being a high school music director.  They've been at their part-time job for 4 years while saving up money to travel across the country to take that next audition and their manager leaves and they get offered a promotion, but that means they have to work full time and can't continue practicing their trumpet enough to win an audition anymore ... so they take it because they are tired of being poor and want to propose to their significant other and move on with their life.\n\nIt's the same with the PhD in almost every field.  You'll get tired of playing the post-doc game and get a job in industry somewhere doing something and it'll pay a heck of a lot better.  Maybe 1 in 20 will find a tenure track position in academia because they were particularly hard working, picked the right area that was ripe for publishing, but yeah 19 in 20 chance that's not you because are you really that much more prolific of a writer vs the rest of your colleagues?  Are you that much more brilliant?  Probably not, at least not statistically, you'll just get lucky (if your goal is academia) or you won't.\n\nI think most people will have more realistic expectations if they go into their PhD assuming they'll get an industry job.  I'd personally rather have 95% of industry jobs available vs a professorship in my field, but that's just me.

For example, saying that your purpose is to work with research (that's kinda obvious, otherwise you shouldn't be applying to a PhD anyway) or that you're applying to a certain school because it has a good reputation (if the school has a good reputation, that's again kinda obvious, and if it doesn't, then it's a lie). \n\nA good statement of purpose should focus on the questions they want answered. For example.  \n\n\\- Why do you want to do a PhD?\n\n\\- What are your research interests and why do you want to research that?\n\n\\- Why did you choose this school? \n\n\\- Why do you think you have what it takes to do a PhD?\n\n\\- What are your goals after you graduate, and how do you this the school can help you with that?\n\nAnd you should provide good, convincing answers.

I did this during the early 2010s.  I had already finished my MSc. then got a job in industry while continuing on part-time for my PhD at the same university where I got my masters.\n\n**\\[Was it\\] difficult to manage your time?**\n\nNormally no more difficult than if I were in a normal PhD program.  I worked a research position that expected 30 hours a week towards that job and then the rest of my time was dedicated to PhD and my own personal time.  I feel like I may have overall pulled some longer hours, but I never had exams to grade, courses to teach, academic deadlines to worry about, etc... just an occasional conference to present at, and always presenting my work research not my PhD research.\n\n**Would you recommend over a full time PhD?**\n\nThis honestly depends.  I thought it was great because I earned ok money and my wife and I were buying our first home at the time so that was nice vs what a normal PhD stipend was.  It certainly extended the duration of my PhD so you'd need to do a NPV analysis of expected earnings for each possibility ... but I got a decent amount of industry experience while I was in my PhD program so I feel that made a big difference on my resume since I had zero desire to remain in academia.\n\n**What was/is your salary?**\n\n$45000/yr w/up to $2500/quarter performance bonus for productivity/publishing/presenting at conferences as well as full PhD tuition reimbursement.  It also came with 10 days PTO + big holidays.  All said, it wasn't a terrible gig for only working 30 hour weeks with all the other perks.\n\n**Are these roles quite common?**\n\nUnsure.  I kinda lucked into this role and it didn't seem that common.  I had worked at this company for a few years after undergrad before I got my masters.  I still had a few contacts there when the job was posted.  The company got a private grant to take on a hand full of research projects that were to last 3 years.  They specifically were looking for somebody who was ABD in a PhD program to do these research projects while they were working on their dissertation.  I had just finished my masters the previous year.  During the interview process, I was finishing my university's doctoral research course and had just passed my quals.  I interviewed and actually didn't get the job right away; I was the #2 choice out of a few dozen applicants.  A month after I was told that I didn't get the job, I got a call saying their #1 had to decline due to some sort of family situation (they didn't tell me exactly because privacy and all that) but I said yes.  I was basically always in the right place at the right time to get this gig.\n\n**Obviously the PhD will take longer to complete compared to the full time route, but does working alongside provide an added benefit or just more stress?**\n\nDefinitely not more stress, but I don't stress out about stuff.  It did take me longer to complete my dissertation, no doubt about that.  I feel like I was just working and in my career while doing a side research project (my PhD) that was supported by my company and where the research was kinda related and potentially helpful (although way more theoretical).  One negative was that I felt almost like an outsider at both my company and my university.  I didn't talk to my advisor as often as full-timers would have just because I didn't have all that much to talk about since I was only going at like 1/3 to 1/2 the speed conducting my research and writing stuff.  I wasn't in the nitty-gritty at work either, like I wasn't on projects with other people.  I shared a big corner office with two people: the director of client acquisition (who wasn't really in the office much), and the director of IT, who just wore her headphones all day doing server stuff and answering emails.  I didn't really have the opportunity to mingle with other coworkers.  I presented updates on my research every quarter to the CEO, COO, VP of R&amp;D, and a senior researcher from the company that endowed the grant funding my position.  Other than those people, I didn't really work with anybody else and it wasn't like I was really working directly with any of them even though they were the ones that I talked to about my research.  It was honestly the loneliest job I've ever had.  I didn't have the camaraderie that many have with other PhD students at their university.  I didn't spend much time on campus, I wasn't in a literature discussion group with other PhD students, I didn't TA with other professors, I didn't sit around the department lounge grading papers and commiserating with other grad students, I didn't spend time at the university except for when I showed up to meet for my advisor or attend a colloquium.  People at my university knew who I was but I don't know if anybody except the department secretary and my advisor would have even asked where I was had simply disappeared for a few months.\n\n\\------------------\n\nI imagine my experience would have been different had I been an RA at my university.  I don't think my uni had 100% dedicated RA jobs.  As far as I knew, if you took a stipend, you had to TA/RA as well as do your program.  If your advisor had a big enough research program to have you do research with them, then you did that, otherwise you were TAing undergrad classes and were assigned by the department rather than your advisor.  Sometimes you did a mix of both.  I'm sure people who did that also took longer than people who were either on a genius grant or just outright paid for the PhD tuition and 100% only worked on their dissertation.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ixdeug/anyone_doing_a_parttime_phd_as_part_of_a_research/g6c3933/"}, "2413": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "InterfectoremPlantae", "Date": 1600883433, "Score": 1, "Body": "Wow is this me?

Particularly relative to your own, or anyone else's.  Regardless of the assignment, doing something well, and having those processes/procedures become second nature, is a skill- it requires repetition.  With practice will come proficiency and comfort.  Coincidentally, paper length is probably parabolic in many cases.  They can be short because one lacks mastery of the subject matter. Conversely, they can be short because the depth of one's understanding facilitates taking all the available/relevant \\[pieces of\\] information others enumerate in 20 pages, and synthesizing it into their own original argument.   - This is the difference between papers that read like \n\n\"X,Y,&amp;Z (####) said this. In XXXX, A, B, C, similarly found. Research by D et al (####) also found evidence of, while some of their contemporaries found slightly different results\"\n\nvs. \n\n\"There's a thing that happens (X,Y, Z, ####; ABC, ####, D et al (####), but contemporary researchers found evidence suggesting additional factors\"   \n\nget me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20 page person here;\n\n1) I have always been like that.  It's cause shit is complex- a substantial amount of space gets taken up by trying to illustrated the nature of those complexities, drawing a line directly between them and relevant contributing factors within the system, discuss the dynamic created by the interaction of said contributing factors, and, attempt to address how the overall \\[nature of the\\] system has actually defined the either the relationship or the problem.\n\nNow, to be fair, 2) I study politics, policy, administration - particularly related to issues of justice and equity. Particularly because we are talking about how to construct complex interventions to affect substantive and lasting change -- I have always been convinced that all of the above is deeply important to an holistic understanding of the issue.  I think the argument can be made this is true, to some degree, across most/all of social science....but if we are talking labs and proofs here, \"done\" can be a much more finite concept. All that just to say, \"don't beat yourself up universally by thinking you're bad at something all the time, when the difficulty/feasibility, even the justification, for doing what you speak of, can vary widely across different assignments.\"\n\n3) The real skill, or talent, or ability, is being able to organize and articulate one's narrative in such a way as to address the issues succinctly. I am just a long-winded story-teller by nature, I spend TOO much time explaining the pieces, and it makes the entire 20 pages much less fluid.  Furthermore, it took years of practice failing by trying to cover too much at once, I have actually gotten really proficient at drawing the precise boundaries of my 'box' (research question -&gt; argument -&gt; paper).  However, no matter what I have tried, I am just perpetually out of sync with whomever is evaluating my work, when it comes to what they think should have been in the box. Over the course of *100* semester, college level classes, whether it was a writing assignment, research paper, or exam,  the instant a length or time limit gets put into play, I turned into \"That Guy\" for a couple minutes while I first cajoled, then badgered the professor as far as they would go,toward defining exactly what they *thought* I should be covering/how they *expected* me to address it.  Obviously, around 65+% of the time , they either laughed or scoffed and said \"**just talk about what's important**\" (just for context, I read every assignment before class, everyday, frequently carrying on 2 or 3 way conversations with professors to eat up the 3hrs when nobody else read, and have had relatively close and personal relationships with the majority of my professors.  I'm not disparaging them, and they actively liked me when they would say that).\n\nThe answer was never what I personally thought was important.  This led me to either spend hours at home agonizing over which pieces to include, or experiencing the only bouts of test anxiety I ever had- while I frantically tried to group what I thought were the right set of topics together on the inside of that bluebook, to give them the answer they wanted. \n\nYou wanna talk about paper envy? I am constitutionally incapable of writing a 3 page policy memo- which is a fundamental aspect of the assignment itself, and represented over half of the assignments over the course of my MPP.   Forget next to, I was literally surrounded by people whom spent less time, investing less effort, conducting less thorough research, but they always got better grades.  I either got marked down for exceeding maximum length, or would get comments asking why I did not address X, when I spent the last 2 days wading through an existential crisis, specifically deciding not to include X.   I was so frustrated at myself for legitimately failing after concerted effort to learn how everyone else but me seemed perfectly capable of satisfying the requirements.

In fact, at that point (also a skill) you shouldn't need to read much of it at all, in order to write a paragraph explaining what that author/research adds to, explains, provides context for, deviates, or would have to say about/contribute to, what you/your sources have already said.

I think the important thing is whatever we are writing about is comprehensive and covers good science (or whatever your subject is). Being concise is a plus not a negative thing. Don't be down for being able to writing things concisely. But it may be worth checking and see if your topic is exploring important concepts related to the topic. I realized that when I was writing my paper that was the hardest part for me as well.\n\nThe reason for expanding your topic is to better understand the implication of your study. For instance, some concepts related to the topics (B) are related to the study topic of your choice (A). In simplistic examples, it may be possible that A contributes to cause B. Alternatively, A may give some inspiration to how to understand B. Additionally, expounding a bit more people may appreciate the importance of what your paper is talking about. For example, let say that people are already familiar with B but your paper is explaining how A and B are related? Then, your paper would get the attention by the audience showing that your research topic (A) is indeed worth understanding or investigating.\n\nI struggled with that, a big time. I think that's one of the hardest parts about research.\n\nSome of the ways that helped me has been reading a lot of related articles (see what others have considered). But note that as with every research, a possibility is infinite but one way may lead you to more concrete research versus others. (This is also another reason why research usually take a lot of efforts and time). Therefore, I found it extremely helpful to talk to other experts. As a grad student, this is the part that I gained useful help from my advisor. He has been in the field way more so that he may have better insights to which direction may be interesting, some ways that may lead to a dead-end or when to move on from a certain approach. The caveat is that my mentor didn't know some things just as much as I didn't for some projects. It was helpful to accept that he may give \\*additional\\* guidance not necessary \\*primary\\* guidance. But it doesn't hurt to have a mentor to give some feedback and share insights with me.\n\nI struggled for a long time with the same issue that you're having. I learned and am still learning.

Just telling what I want to say in each part/chapter in a few sentances, no explanations, no argumentation, just the main ideas. Then it will be way easier to start actual writting. It is quite difficult to start from blank and easier to just take an idea an expand it.\n\n\\- 2nd: I am expanding the ideas. This step writes the content, no bother with style. I am explaining the ideas, argumenting, putting the references, etc. That's the core of the paper, and I focus on it, for now it's not a problem if you are repeting yourself too much, or if it not well written.\n\n\\- 3rd: This step makes your paper smooth and nice to read. This means style, but more than that: is the text clear, not too difficult to understand, is there a nice \"flow\" in your paper, the good amount of repetitions (not too much, not too few). Will a reader be able to easily grasp the ideas and what you want to say if he just reads quickly abstract/methodology/conclusion ? I mean, just think about the papers that were a pain in the ass to read and try to avoid making the same mistakes as them. Nothing is more painful to read than a paper where you have to go back and forth a thousand time to understand exactly what the guy is doing. You are writting a book where building climax until the end, it should be easy to understand for someone who is passing 2min on it, as well as for someone reading the whole.\n\n\\- 4rd: Proofreading. For typos, missing references, position of figures, etc. Just read while being very critical to everything.\n\nUsually for one part/chapter I perform each step on a different day, and not everything in a row, to avoid getting stuck on one particular idea/formulation.

And break it down. The day you get your syllabi, plug all your due dates into your calendar, for reading, assignments, quizzes, etc., and schedule times to do the work. More time to the important stuff, less to the things you just need to get by in. If you only have one large assignment due at the end, break it down into steps and enter those steps with intermediate deadlines into your calendar. Leave buffer time because some tasks will take longer than expected, and also schedule in breaks. For example leave a day or two between the time that you complete your first draft and the time that you're going to edit it. That way your mind will be fresh and do better work more efficiently. \n\nI usually create this schedule the first week of my classes, usually inputting every class is syllabus the first day I get it and then making adjustments as I get the next syllabus. It generally takes me an hour or two per class, but then for the rest of the semester I'm never wondering what I should be doing. That can often create the delays and lead to inefficiency. also having to pause and decide what we're going to do next is actually taxing on our brain. We all suffer from something called decision fatigue. It's real and it's costly. Take all of that out of the equation right now. That way every morning when you get up you just look at your calendar and you're off to the races. It's never going to be perfect and you're always going to be making adjustments, but it lets you pace yourself and removes a lot of the decision fatigue and uncertainty and the anxiety that comes with that. \n\nIf you're not sure how long it takes you to do something, Time yourself the first two or three times and then adjust from there. For example I know how long it takes me to write five pages, and how long it takes me to do the research that would go into those five pages, And how long to read an easy-to-read assigned text, or a dense assigned text, or a text that I can just skim. Or how long it takes me to do a bit of field research, for example. Then when you're making your schedule, model it around those times plus 15%, because you're always going to get distracted by your phone or have to go to the bathroom.\n\nAnd my number one piece of advice is to get enough sleep. No matter what prioritize your sleep. Your brain works best when you take care of it. A sleep deprived brain will do poor work, And you'll have to go back and fix it later. Oh well rested brain will do good work and will save you time in the long run.\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/izaok8/how_do_you_manage_the_workload_of_classes_im_so/g6jbk9m/"}, "2672": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ConsistentlyPeter", "Date": 1601044620, "Score": 1, "Body": "Ha! \ud83d\ude3a Thank you - I hope you find a way to make some space for yourself.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/izhnty/5_top_tips_for_phdgrad_students_my_uni/g6je817/"}, "2673": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ConsistentlyPeter", "Date": 1601044707, "Score": 3, "Body": "I\u2019m so pleased it helped.

You have one well paid person (the professor) 'supervising' anywhere from 2 to 15 or so mentees at a time (depending on the size of the group) that get paid an annual stipend of $20,000-$30,000 per year, give or take. They all work their asses off on the hopes that they too will one day become a professor. \n\nScientific advancement is now being driven by these people in their mid 20s and 30s being paid close to minimum wage as they go through their PhDs. From the universities' perspectives, in terms of producing number of publications per dollar spent, this is the best business model, unfortunately. However, not all of those people getting these PhDs can go on to become a professor, there are nowhere near enough professorship jobs. The number of people wanting to become a professor just keeps piling up year after year while the number of job openings for professorships stays the same or perhaps is even in decline. You could go on to do amazing things during your PhD (publish in PNAS, Nature, Science, etc.), win prestigious awards, present at major conferences, etc. and then apply for 50 or so jobs and not even get an interview. Tons and tons of people in this situation or worse. Keep your expectations in check.\n\nHonestly, industry isn't even looking too great nowadays. I see a lot of PhD industry jobs in engineering and other STEM fields with literally hundreds of applicants. Hundreds. There's just too many people with PhDs produced by the above mentioned... again... multi-level marketing scheme.

The supervisor sometimes then can have some say in which candidates get put forward to the funding body board, but sometimes not. If you're successful, you get invited to interview for the project against all the other projects in the call (sometimes one student per project). A handful of projects + students will then be awarded funding for the project. The other students+projects fail to get funding. \n\nThese programs in the UK can be very competitive. Not only are you competing to be the student for the project, but the project out of all the proposed projects (maybe as little as 1 in 4 will get funding). They tend to rely a lot of academic grades to weed people out at the first stage before interview. I was told by a potential supervisor that although they liked my CV and skills, that you basically needed a 1st at undergrad and distinction at MSc to get past the first round (please don't take this as truth, it was just one person). The supervisor put me forward and the board rejected me (I had a 2.1 and was on track for distinction at MSc). \n\nThe good news is... These programs are not the only ones out there. Some projects have secured funding before they advertise and then you aren't competing against other projects. Some projects are funded through the supervisor and means the supervisor can interview and recruit the student of their choice. With your work experience, supervisors might find you a really attractive option because you have proven skills and are used to working in professional lab environments etc. Some supervisors don't place much importance on grades if you have this extra experience and you make a good impression in interview.\n\nDon't give up!

I mean competition is probably going to be a lot stiffer, but there would be a garaunteed spot for you, likely with a higher probability of *some* form of funding, than you might get by carpet bombing schools directly.\n\nIf you really want to make it happen, the universal brute-force advice seems to be put together a couple different grouping so things you [can say?] you are interested in/motivated to pursue. Basically, take some values, subjects, dynamics, research goals, project ideas (not necessarily all of them, I was just trying to provide a broad array of potential/examples), that can fit together into a nice narrative to describe yourself as a researcher/colleague/candidate when you are wearing that 'hat.\"   Put together a couple hats you either like wearing, or can look good wearing-- then you gotta pound the dept/faculty bio links at a bunch of programs, see whom are the most respected faculty and anyone that also holds administrative positions, and any others that have substantial overlapping interests with your hat/s.\n\nI would suggest making some email templates by writing the pieces to a narrative for each hat - and leave THE CLEARLYEST YOU EVA MARKED, positions to insert targeted references. Craft positions where names and be seamlessly substituted in and out. A couple places to reference the school and program by name. Places designed to reference faculty research interests are rougher to setup, but that should be the only thing to which you actually need to devote attention and energy in a given cycle. Also can be valuable to scrape their list of prior publications-- I saved that to shore up ones I felt were weak, or those programs I found most attractive.\n\nMy opinion is to be upfront with who you are, what you are trying to do, your concerns, and say you are just looking to who would respond, if they had a read on the situation at their institution, had any advice, suggestions on whom you might want to talk to, or what you might be able to do in order to ensure your application is as competitive as you can make it.  I would definitely make passing mention that is something you are incredibly driven to pursue, but given yours and current circumstances it is not economically or temporally feasible to submit applications everywhere you would be happy going. Furthermore given your overlapping/interest in their work and working with them, that even if you aren't able to make it happen this cycle, you are still excited to take this opportunity to network/develop relationships/find your people - because the pandemic makes much more difficult to cultivate new relationships with fellow conference attendees. You would ostensibly be interested in working with/collaborating/assisting any of the people you are emailing.

I will say that the push for publication is present here while it is completely lacking in the EdD.\n\nFor me, it made sense to do both- mainly because I couldn't stomach getting a third masters. The EdD will provide the administrative endorsement and knowledge that are needed to make that move in K-12, while the Ph.D. will allow for greater knowledge of research needs/practices/ideals and the possibility of a higher-ed position.  Although, if you are wanting a professorship in education departments the number of Ph.D.s and EdD's are pretty evenly split- at least in the three uni's in which I've worked and learned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't see a reason not to pursue the education you want. You don't have to jump right into administration or using the Ed.D.- although if being a full-time professor with tenure is your goal it may be better to wait on a Ph.D. until you can move right from that to a position in HigherEd. At my school, it is harder to get a position the longer the gap between your graduation and your application.

In theory it was the start of my final year. Panic attacks when I left home in the morning and the rest. Started therapy, learned a whole ton about myself, also ended up diagnosed with ADHD, which helped a ton. Did a lot of self reflection, didn't know if sucking it up was worth 1-2 years of misery and this soul-sucking unhappiness. I also didn't have any intention of continuing in STEM or even industry, I wanted out. As I was weighing up my options, lockdown hit, which relieved all the lab pressure. I basically took the following months to take it easy, start compiling the parts of the work I've liked most for thesis chapters, and spend time on other things/hobbies that bring me joy and could be possible work/career choices. I appreciate that I was *very* lucky to have this chance.\n\nThe \"break\", ongoing therapy, learning more about my ADHD and different ways to manage that, and spending more time on fun stuff/hobbies that are completely removed from my PhD work, meant I could slowly come back to my PhD work and feel gradually better about it. I've also got other things going on in my life that give me meaning, and I'm not going to let the PhD take over again. I am currently not in a position where I am likely to graduate soon, so that is weighing heavily on me, but for now I have a happier healthier relationship with my PhD work. I made a lot of progress on myself, which had a positive effect on a lot of other things. And in my current state of mind, I'm ok to just see how it goes, and I can always quit down the line if I decide to. I'm no longer hating each second \"wasted\" on my PhD.\n\nI don't know your situation but my PhD itself is.. not ideal but ok. My supervisor left but I have a new one who is mostly experienced in my field, and she's very understanding. The department is like a family. My partner can support me, both emotionally and also financially if necessary, so worst case scenario, we'll be ok. We're settled in our current town so our lives aren't on hold. If one or a few of these were different, I'm not sure if I'd make a different decision.\n\nThrowing out some ideas... do you think it would be possible or worth it to take a break for 2-3 weeks, a proper break where you really get away from it all?

My job I had during school has moved into a higher, contributing role that I feel like I get to apply a lot of the things I enjoyed about research, except now at a more specialized level. My other position is early in a startup developing something new, which has been really exciting.\n\nOne of the more honest professors I worked with one time told me that if you want to make a significant contribution go to industry. I never really took that to heart until now. It's honestly really nice in a big way being able to not be put on hold for 3-5 years to get another degree, but to start now. Is it in the classroom or research lab? Not at all. However, I'm still learning big things everyday and can hopefully create something pretty cool from that someday. \n\nI think another thing is how Corona has really highlighted how poorly treated/disposable professors are to academia. While students are not as much at risk with Corona, professors are. But largely are still expected to sacrifice. \n\nSide note: I seriously wonder if academia will drastically change over the next few years in the sense of more online schools or specialized/trade options.

It is definitely not for someone who is seeking a good job with good financial stability. Even tenured positions at universities are no longer guaranteed due to covid and all that jazz. My recommendation is this: if you truly are passionate about pursuing a phD, consider doing it part-time while having a normal job, it will not only give you more time to work on your research (3 years is not enough, trust me) but also you will have a JOB which is something most people that do phDs full-time wish they could get easily.\n\nHaving said that, remember that university jobs (e.g. lecturing, research, etc.) are still a 9-5 job like every other job and there is a lot of ADMIN tasks (literally business meetings weekly with Deans and heads of department about finances, changes to budgets, etc.) as well as supervising research and doing a lot of your own research. Most professors I know have to also work weekends from home because the workload is too high, and the pay is definitely not justified (the most you could ever make as a professor is still not good enough compared to say a medical doctor or a lawyer). \n\nSo if you must do it, do it part-time and get a normal job in an area you like or at least can tolerate.

Tried to re ignite the curiosity: Instead of reading things related to project, I started reading random academic papers on topics which make me curious. I started reading about volcanoes, glaciers, astronomy, migratory behavior of animals etc. These topics are no where close to my research area. This  has definitely helped me in changing the mindset.\n3. Learning something new: I have started learning coding in Python.

I have worked with managers during hiring and I have been through applications myself. Have some examples of you solving a problem and how did you go about it. Even better if you have numbers. Example: \"Normally these devices lose their performance by destructive oxidation in air. By developing this new surface passivation technique by doing xyz, I saw an improvement in my device performance by 20%.\" Secondly, they will ask conflict resolution questions. The two I see that gets asked the most are \"give us an example of when you had conflict with your PI, how did you resolve this?\" and also \"how do you resolve conflict among your coworkers in the lab.\" These conflict resolutions questions should be answered with some examples.
