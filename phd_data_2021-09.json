Assuming your advisor is a good academic and publishing in good spots, that will give you a general idea of what you might see in your area. (Disregard if you think your advisor may be publishing in sketchy areas, though. Hopefully not a problem but it does come up sometimes.) What sort of range are you seeing from them? Their lower impact papers may be reasonable places to shoot and reasonable impact factors to be considering-- maybe not worth trying the *best* journal they have published in (yet), but maybe a journal they have published in and clearly think is acceptable. \n\nI think choosing a journal is super hard and is a serious skill that is difficult to develop. I'm in psychology, so I tend to look at the APA-affiliated journals first, and then sort of branch out to find places publishing articles sort of *like* my article. I also don't think you need to be the absolute arbiter of what journal you shoot for, especially if you have more experienced co-authors that may have some good ideas. On one of the papers I am presently working, I am actually second author, and one of the tasks I was assigned was to find a few journal options, present some basic info and stats about their impact factor/turnaround time/acceptance rate/fit for our paper, and then we discussed the options as a team. \n\nOne other consideration to throw out is to look over the CVs of other people in your lab-- where have they published? There are a few journals on my radar literally only because they took papers from other people in my lab. \n\nI also know people who really weigh where they submit based on what journals they are citing. E.g. Did I cite the Journal of Whatever fifteen times? Maybe we should be seriously considering the Journal of Whatever. (YMMV on that, of course, and that's not a strategy I have personally used much. But just an idea!)\n\n*\n\nAs with others I have only heard of h-index with regard to researchers. Again, things are likely to vary by field. In psychology at an R1, most of my professors are in the 30-50 range with the hard hitters in the 100+ range, so 100 papers that have been cited at least 100 times. You can google folks' names and \"h index\" to see what is normal-- look at some newer profs in your department, more established profs, and whoever the tippy top of your field is. As a current student, my h-index is 1-- and I'm proud of that one citation, damnit!-- and I'm looking forward to it doubling soon, hopefully, lol.\n\nETA: it does look like h-index is reported for the journals I searched and it's the same deal-- an h-index of 200 means that 200 articles have been cited 200 times. Unless I am misunderstanding, I am not sure that I feel like h-index can be easily interpreted for a journal, though, since journals vary in how long they have existed (academics also get an h-index benefit from being older, but people still have... some more limitations on how long they are alive/productive).

The first thing is to realize that it\u2019s not about THEM as a person or scientist. It\u2019s about the findings and the finding\u2019s strengths, limitations, and implications for the field. So instead of saying things like \u201cthis author\u2019s finding is not supported\u201d, provide evidence and objectivity for why their findings aren\u2019t complete or need to be investigated further. Highlight both strengths and weaknesses of their findings. The second thing to keep in mind is that your review is in of itself a contribution to the field. Reviews help to summarize the current state of a field. It helps colleagues realize where further work needs to be done. Therefore, it\u2019s very important to include the limitations of already published work (what matters is how you do it). In the same vane, remaining objective and providing evidence when critiquing work is a service to the field. Reviews are highly valuable sources of information and they don\u2019t get enough credit for their importance. It also helps your PhD efforts.

I\u2019ve struggled with depression since childhood, so fortunately by the time I got to my PhD I had figured out how to  cope to the best or my ability.  It\u2019s all subjective, so whatever it is that helps you, I think the key is to have those things in your life before shit gets overwhelming.  \n\nHowever, for me:\n* take my dog for a walk (I got a dog because I know they help me with depression and anxiety)\n* go on a hike (I moved next to a forest so that it was always accessible)\n* grill in the yard (for some reason this relaxes me)\n* understand that it is OKAY to say \u201cfuck it, I\u2019ve been working hard, I deserve this\u201d and stop working earlier in the day.  For me, I\u2019m unable to shut down my mental \u201cwork mode\u201d until after 5PM, and I end up getting anxious if I try to not work at like 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so I usually drink beer to force myself to embrace relaxation mode.\n* it\u2019s easy to lose myself in cycles of overwork, and stressors/anxieties gradually pile up in the back of my mind: I lose clarity of them as time goes on, but they continue to haunt me in their own invisible way.  Twice a year or so I set aside a day to meditate and come to terms with the state of my life, and work to better understand what is going on in the foreground and background of my mind.  I\u2019ll just say, on such days I do take psychedelics to catalyze introspection, but it\u2019s totally not necessary, and everybody has their own subjective meditation practices.  However, I do grow my own mushrooms for this purpose, which brings me to my next point.\n* Hobbies.  It\u2019s hard to find time for things that I used to love (reading, art, etc), but occasionally an obligation to hobbies is helpful.  For me, I know that I feel good when I am \u201cmaking\u201d things, so my hobbies are cooking, gardening, brewing beer, and mycology.  Whatever hobbies you can fit in at the end of a rough day will help you mentally refresh, even if at first it feels like just another obligatory task.\n* email-avoidance (not necessarily the best thing, but it works for me):  I love my research, and sometimes my work is my favorite activity.  But you know what stresses me out beyond belief?  Emails.  So many people to respond to, so many collaborative logistics to juggle.  I do work weekends, but that\u2019s just because it\u2019s fun for me.  But I have a hard policy of (almost) never checking emails on weekends.  That is my designated time to get cozy, gradually work myself into a state of deep-focus, where I can actually experience a \u201cflow\u201d.  Connecting with my work this way on my days off helps give me a sense of project-clarity, which makes things easier during the stressful week-days where the convoluted maze of emails, meetings, classes, seminars, and presentations always prevent me from actually turning in and *truly* focusing on my work.  \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m super sorry to hear that you\u2019re dealing with the death of people in your life.  It\u2019s hard.  I hope you\u2019re okay, and please always remember that there are people around you who care, and who you can open up to about anything you\u2019re struggling with.

I\u2019m a first year PhD student and for this first year I\u2019m on fellowship, which means I\u2019m paid a stipend just to take classes and earn credits toward my degree. Starting next year, I\u2019ll earn my stipend by teaching classes in the department.\n\nI think fellowships like mine are pretty rare, most of the time if you\u2019re earning a stipend you\u2019re performing some kind of teaching/grading/research service in your department. In my master\u2019s program I earned a stipend too, but I taught at least two classes every semester.\n\nThis is usually what\u2019s meant when you hear people talk about \u201cfunding\u201d in grad school, at least in the US. Ideally, you would find a program that covers your tuition &amp; fees and pays you a monthly stipend. Most universities require grad students to have health insurance, and some funding packages cover most if not all of your insurance premiums. The amount you earn and what\u2019s covered really depends on where you end up. Different programs at different universities will offer you different stipends. My offers this last application cycle ranged from 14,000 to 29,000/yr. You also want to be aware of cost of living wherever you decide to go to school. I was offered competitive funding at several different programs, but one of the universities was in a much more affordable city than the others and the money I earn goes much further where I live now than, say, somewhere like New York or LA.\n\nI\u2019m terms of stipulations, again it depends on your department and program. In my master\u2019s program, I worked as a teaching assistant and I was required to take a certain amount of credits each semester in the department, which usually wasn\u2019t a big deal because those were classes I needed to take for my degree credits anyway. It only because cumbersome near the end of my program after I earned all my required credits, when I was doing thesis research. I would have preferred to just work on my thesis, but since I was teaching in the department and earning a stipend for it, I was required to be enrolled in a certain number of credits for classes I didn\u2019t necessarily need anymore in addition to thesis work. Technically, I could have chosen not to take those courses and just focus on my thesis work, but then I would have been ineligible to keep my teaching assistantship, which would have meant no tuition coverage/stipend/health insurance, so I didn\u2019t really have a choice. But policies like this vary depending on your university or department.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you\u2019re admitted to a graduate program in US you should expect some kind of funding offer. Some programs will admit students without funding but depending on your field and potential ROI, it\u2019s rarely worth funding a master\u2019s or PhD yourself, especially in the humanities. \n\nYou can also occasionally negotiate your funding offer if you have another competitive offer from another program, though you\u2019ll want to be careful and very tactful with how you do that.\n\nMy advice would be to scour your programs\u2019 websites and see what they say about funding, particularly if they mention whether or not most students admitted to that program or grad school receive funding. If you happen to know any profs or current students in the program, it might be a good idea to get in contact with them and ask about department funding opportunities. The department\u2019s DGS (director of graduate studies) will often be a good point of contact for those kinds of questions, though you may not want to make it the first question you ask them. If you\u2019re a competitive applicant though, departments will usually do what they can to convince you to accept their offer so it\u2019s not a totally inappropriate question. They know grad students live on shoestring budgets, and they know it\u2019s a major factor of consideration for most of us.\n\nThat being said, the best choice isn\u2019t always the one that pays you the most. Your first choice should be based on a combination of merits, and should be the place where you think you\u2019ll most thrive intellectually and professionally. Weigh your funding offers against that, you may have some tough decisions but ultimately it\u2019s better to choose a program that fits best than one that doesn\u2019t just because it comes with a higher stipend. As long as you can live safely and relatively comfortably, go where you think makes the most sense for what you want to do later.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pg3h0d/stipends/hba3olw/"}, "278": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Individual-Schemes", "Date": 1630559786, "Score": 3, "Body": "It's the same for most disciplines in the US.

Especially since you don\u2019t want to do academia, barely anybody in the industry world will care about what you did your PhD on. It\u2019s a means to an end for many graduate students, and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about it. Your physical and mental health is the number one priority, though. Make sure you can stay healthy. Find other things in grad school to enjoy - clubs, sports, friends, etc...

I guess I would say, firstly, that I don't see obtaining a doctorate as being self-improvement. Of course there's nothing wrong with taking pride in your achievements, and there's something admirable about people doing things just because they can (\"Why did he climb the mountain? Because it was there.\") However, in the case I'm thinking of, the 'proving oneself' is about attempting to mitigate/undo a perceived failure, not achieve something for its own positive reason. I don't see that as healthy.\n\nA PhD is an incredibly hard thing to do, with potentially nothing to gain from it (and it can be significantly disruptive to your personal life, career plans, finances, and mental health. Not always, but it can). Now if you're going to do it just because you want to prove to yourself that you can, I don't see an issue with that - 'proving yourself' in this way I don't have issue with per se. If, on the other hand, you're going into the process because you have a chip on your shoulder about a previous failure, and you're trying to make up for that in some way, that seems silly to me. Particularly because a PhD often tends to have the effect of making you feel *more* stupid, *more* incapable, and *more* worthless while you do it.\n\nThis relates to the martyr complex thing. I had a supervision today, and during a call lasting 1hr and 15min, there were *three* sentences communicating \"you're doing well and nearly there\". The entire rest was \"this is wrong, that isn't good enough, why have you done this, why haven't you done that?\" etc. And this is from a good, supportive supervisor, who acknowledges how difficult a thing that is to experience but points out that it is necessary in order to make sure my work is ready for the rigorous scrutiny of examination. It can be very, very hard. I'm not some fresh-faced young chicken: I came back to my PhD years after finishing my undergrad. I have worked in the real world, and continued to work throughout the degree (I part-timed), and I have *never* encountered anything as difficult, as rigorous, and as self-doubt producing as this degree. It is ***hard***, in a way I just didn't conceive going in. And given that most people seem to post here during hard times, when they need support, I can understand why it might feel like we're carrying a martyr complex. But then I suspect part of that is due to the very thing that I'm criticising: so many people who go into these degrees do it because they need to *be the best*, and then get absolutely whalloped by what it does to their self-esteem. But they *can't quit*, they *cannot fail*, and so now they're trapped in this thing that feels like it's destroying them but they *have to succeed in order to be valid*.\n\nDoes that sound dramatic? Well that's why you shouldn't go into this with the primary intention of proving yourself 'better' than the grade you got on your undergrad. Because if you're the kind of person who has that as your motivation, this thing is going to wreck you.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ph2seo/terrible_reasons_to_get_a_phd/hbgzoqn/"}, "634": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nathan_lesage", "Date": 1630691035, "Score": 0, "Body": "Whoa, hello, twin \u2014 both the reasons why to begin  and why to continue are exactly the same for me (except that I really enjoy research and don\u2018t get to teach yet although I\u2018m looking forward to that as well)!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ph2seo/terrible_reasons_to_get_a_phd/hbh0iwk/"}, "635": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "femmersl", "Date": 1630691557, "Score": 6, "Body": "Pay is decent? \ud83d\udc40 how much are you making as a PhD candidate, because most student are massively underpaid\u2026", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ph2seo/terrible_reasons_to_get_a_phd/hbh1rfk/"}, "636": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "anintellectuwoof", "Date": 1630691696, "Score": 1, "Body": "This summer I spent a HUGE portion of my time hand correcting our thousands of rows of data because participant information got switched around or off by a cell several different times.

The issue isn't the PhD; it's the concentration and experience people are receiving that doesn't translate into things outside of academia.\n\nIn other words, does your work translate into a product or a service of some sort that can be or is currently sold? If you're in a field that typically does not produce products or some kind of service, it becomes much more difficult to find a job outside of academia. The PhD just by itself isn't going to typically get you a job.\n\nHiring of any sort happens on a need that is to be fulfilled. The degree provides an indication of competence and ability, but if your experience doesn't align with what a job needs, you will not get hired.\n\nThe traditional advice is that you have other skills that you generally learn as a PhD student (e.g. some level of project management, teaching, etc.). While this is true, it's also something that's also true for *every other individual with a PhD and even Masters looking for a job*.

I agree that the degree its self isn't what gets you a job. You have to develop other soft skills to be able to work on a team with others and do other things that are required to work a non-academic job.\n\nThat's not specific and special to a PhD though.\n\nYou can have an undergrad or Masters degree and develop those same soft skills *within* industry without ever having to do a PhD. In many cases, you can learn exactly what a company may seek through that route without needing a PhD in the first place. \n\nIt's a semi-relevant strategy in *building a resume*, but I think up-selling these points as if they're a reason to either do a PhD or to promote the PhD does a disservice. A lab manager can write the *same soft skills* down, and may also have even more relevant technical experience depending on the job (and availability of jobs).\n\n&gt;A PhD teaches you how to:\nAnalyze problems from many different angles and develop a plan to fix those problems. It also teaches you how to obtain evidence that that approach will fix the issue. On a more important note, it teaches you how to communicate highly technical information to others who don't have or need to have that background. This is really only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIt *can*, I'm not disagreeing with this. But not all fields are created equally.\n\nThe mistake this sort of advice gives is that *any* project with *any* experience will be relevant to the needs outside of academia. That's wholly incorrect. And you should be very careful on the projects you pursue or the experiences that you're obtaining to make sure that is the case. The point is that this needs to be thought out much earlier prior to applying to jobs.\n\n&gt;But companies want PhDs as highly technical people that can interpret and provide input on what other companies are doing or fix a specific problem at their company. That's why many PhDs in industry get into more senior roles. Because their perspective and approach are sought after.\n\nAgain, broad stroke advice I don't think is particularly helpful and can give the wrong impression. Companies seek out PhDs with *relevant experience* for those technical problems that need to be fixed. If your experience is in developmental neuroscience doing animal surgeries, you will lack a competitive edge in a job for, say, drug design.\n\n&gt;The issue is, people don't know how to sell their PhD to a company outside of academia. There are many skills you learn that don't have to do with your specialized knowledge. You just have to apply them correctly.\n\nI personally don't like this advice, and I've heard it many times before. Just to reiterate what was said before, it implies that all PhDs are created equal, that all experiences are created equal. That simply publishing a few papers and putting these aspects of \"leading a project\" or \"having soft skills\" will be enough to be attractive for a job. That's just not true. \n\nJob opportunities, whether in academia or not, are dependent on relevant skill sets. It's frankly *easier* to sell yourself if your skill sets, the ones directly relevant to your PhD, is applicable to the job that you're seeking. Remember, you're *competing with other PhDs or Masters candidates for a job*. If someone fits better, especially the first round of interviews or when you submit your resume, then you're going to be kicked out. Those other candidates *are as special as you*.\n\nThe advantages you mention are the icing on the cake. The icing alone doesn't make the cake. \n\nI get it if you're in a program already and your cohort are able to get non-academic jobs that are still relevant to the work that they did in their PhD. Yes, that's a selling issue most likely. But the ones I see struggling are PhDs in particular programs that do not have marketable products. It's one thing if your PhD is in material science, or a particular therapeutic method, or some something like toxicology. It's quite another when your field is in, say, evaluating a behavioral mouse method.\n\nBut if you're struggling and scared specifically about how there's limited jobs after a PhD, it likely means your program and/or field are developing projects that are not beneficial for industry, and likely because of a lack of translational applicability. Because quite frankly, there are several fields that already do need and hire PhDs. There's only so much you can twist with some projects.\n\n*Can* you get a job outside of academia with the PhD and push up your soft skills? Yeah, sure. But again, you're competing with *other PhDs, and those with Masters degrees* that may have more relevant experience and be able to do the analytics as well or better than you already.\n\nAs someone that came from one of these fields, the cohort of friends that got jobs outside of academia either had projects that were desirable to companies, or had additional activities along with their PhD or postdoc experiences (e.g. getting certificates or doing additional internships). What got their foot through the door was actually the experience.

I *might* be a unique situation. Still potentially relevant. Story time\u2026\n\nPhD subject = Space Resources\n\n2 years in. Looking for topic the whole time. Considering various topics from data science to logistics to financial analysis - all related to space resources contexts. Was on several proposals that didn\u2019t pan out (including some major ones). Paid own way through classes (b/c I wanted to not wait for project - totally my choice). Already passed Qualifiers too.\n\nFinally got thesis. Was on official NASA Mars mission on the Science Team. Highly prestigious advisor &amp; highly prestigious project. Was dope.\n\nAfter 1 semester, determined advisor was toxic af. Quality of life absolutely tanked. Stress = okay; unhealthy &amp; patently unrealistic expectations aren\u2019t. Spoke with advisor openly and honestly (professionally) about issues. Things got better but then went right back after a week. Decided to leave advisor &amp; subsequently the project. Professional career was explicitly threatened by advisor. Highly unprofessional. I have previous industry experience in management &amp; am perfectly fine sticking up for myself. In talks with relevant authorities regarding this matter.\n\nMy PhD is typically online (we have Pentagon, DoD, DoE, NASA, etc. people in program, so it was designed this way far before Covid). I had a signed lease in the state of my Uni to move there. I had to leave that lease ~4 days before my move-in date. Wasn\u2019t chill, but I had to do what I had to do to not hate life. Throughout the whole thing I was in a long-distance relationship too with my now-wife.\n\nSide note: *NEVER* forget that professors are just random people too and are no better or worse than you. Treat them with respect but also expect them to treat you with respect as well (like any professional environment).\n\nSpent a summer working with a foundation looking at various topics. Settled on an awesome one. Met with relevant prof. Prof destroys hopes. Felt bad but was good to hear. Got me thinking. Rethought entire reason I was in PhD from a First Principles perspective. Eureka moment. Found *awesome* path. Noticed a ridiculous amount of overlap with various other institutions with large budgets.\n\nCurrent time: in talks with prof for advisement (looks good) with an idea of who will be on my committee. Formulating new thesis now. It\u2019s too \u2018cutting edge\u2019 for many grant authorities and I don\u2019t feel like waiting a couple years for relevant ones, so I\u2019m paying my own way. That said, I have a NASA NIAC proposal that\u2019s in the 2nd (and final) stage of consideration. High hopes for it.\n\nCurrent feelings: life is awesome and I\u2019m super jazzed about the path forward. Can\u2019t wait to get to doing research I actually care about instead of being distracted &amp; chasing shiny jewels that profs sometimes hang in front of students.\n\nIn summary: it\u2019s a VERY not straight path. Many, many twists and turns, including the stereotypical \u2018bad advisor\u2019 experience. If handled appropriately, all this come to those who wait, are proactive, and keep working.\n\nLots of other things happened too, like me living in Korea for the first 2 years of the PhD. Feel free to ask questions.\n\nGood luck :)\n\nEdit: forgot to say how I coped. It\u2019s stupidly important b/c I only love life now b/c I coped (sort of) well. The answer = strong family support network, primarily my fianc\u00e9e (now wife). The major things I did were being very open &amp; honest with people, including advisors &amp; other people in my program (e.g. I spoke with multiple faculty and 5+ friends/peers before leave my full GRA on the NASA mission), being very, very honest with myself regarding healthy habits &amp; environment, and lastly, always having more than 1 iron in the fire. Yes, I know working on more than just a GRA isn\u2019t advised, but I *never* put all my eggs in 1 basket and that\u2019s the only reason I was able to leave my leave my unhealthy situation without being absolutely screwed. To be specific, I used my personal free time to also join a group that won NASA funding for a lunar project.

Doing this would be suboptimal for you, but imo there's a lot of other work you can do. \n\nJust a few quick questions/suggestions:\n\n1. How are you using traditional ML models? Presumably the task at hand is an image segmentation problem? (given an aerial view of farmland, segment the map into what crop is on each pixel). I'm a little confused how you can do this without using some form of CNNs/convolutions? Are you using some form of feature extraction? [1]\n\n2. Did you try explaianing how your model is working, i.e. model interpretability? Using something like Grad-CAM for images [2] or SHAP for categorical data [3] to explain exactly what features/parts of the images cause the classifier to make the decision it made? Last I checked, there was no work that was systematically trying to do that. \n\n3. As other comments mentioned, try putting into perspective the computational cost and savings that using ML models will have. \n\n4. If you're working with categorical data, try data oversampling/undersampling strategies (eg. SMOTE/ADASYN) and see if you can get some level of performance boost.\n\nFootnotes/references:\n\n[1] I remember seeing that the Winnipeg Crop Mapping Dataset converted image features to categorical ones: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Crop+mapping+using+fused+optical-radar+data+set\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391\n\n[3] https://github.com/slundberg/shap", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/piegm0/built_my_thesis_on_a_faulty_hypothesis/hbru731/"}, "1026": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "E-Cockroach", "Date": 1630903301, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you very much!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pis2bj/doubts_regarding_phd_application/hbruran/"}, "1027": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "_misst", "Date": 1630903980, "Score": 3, "Body": "Agreed.

I just graduated and I've been looking into the same thing, but in UK and Australian universities. I'm sharing what my seniors and lecturers told me when I mentioned my plans, followed by my personal opinion. A direct PhD route depends on a few factors including your GPA, great academic performance, networking skills and research interest. \n\nFirst off, not everyone thinks of doing a PhD so if you feel like you do then good for you. Second, if you're going, you NEED to start getting as much research experience as you can. Apply for research assistant positions at your current university, network, find positions at other universities. Do this regardless of whether you choose A or B.\n\nConsider funding. Pros in a PhD are that you're given a stipend, a research allowance and given faculty privilieges. Basically, your entire degree is paid for, unlike for a Masters. Personally it'd be difficult for me to pay for a MSc abroad (South Asian currency is sinking in this pandemic \ud83d\ude25) so trust me I was definitely planning for a direct PhD too.\n\nLook into integrated Masters programmes (1+3) if you're unsure of where your research skills lie. It gives you some time to be more selective about a supervisor. Some PhD programmes in the UK follow the 1+3 programme and are competitive but fully-funded.\n\nWhen you do get into a PhD programme, it will be ~1 year of studying (lit review, some coursework, lots of practise, lab rotations) before you start your project so it's not like they release you into the lab unprepared. You'll have seniors and mentors and a small team to help out in addition to your supervisor. It's just that it takes a little extra work since most positions are competitive. You'll have to show previous research experience and genuine interest in the field to get selected.\n\nSenior stories:\nAll these people including myself are in the STEM field btw, idk about your field specifically.\n\nOne completed his BSc, MSc, then took a research assistant job at a high-ranking university. He worked as a lab demonstrator and part-time lecturer for a year or two before starting his PhD there. You might be able to find a RA post at a uni with your Bachelors, it will be competitive but it will be worth it because you get to talk to a supervisor of choice directly, figure out who you wish to work with and come up with a solid research proposal based on your experiences at the lab you'll be working in.\n\nI know of only one senior who got a Fullbright scholarship to a university in USA. She went from Bachelors, did 1 year of research at a local university then on to a direct PhD. She went through so so much, her supervisor was broke and eventually she had to pull out a detailed, well-documented folder of all the ways he messed up and threaten legal action for him to actually help her out. She finished her degree in 6-7 years but said the first 2 years were spent trying to help with other projects and she was treated very badly until she confronted them about mistreatment. I cannot stress enough how important it is to choose your supervisor wisely.\n\nAnother bright young lady moved to Singapore directly after Bachelors, worked as a graduate research assistant and got her PhD. I don't really know her story, it was a bit vague. Wish I knew more.\n\nFinally, your choice in supervisor may make or break you. My Bachelor's research supervisor spent a good 10 minutes explaining that you have to be cordial and get along. It's a 2 way street. This supervisor is someone you're gonna know and associate for more than half a decade of your life, someone who will write your recommendation letters, help you get jobs and be a main point of contact for quite a few years, so you better be picky. Supervisors with industrial contacts can funnel you straight into the industrial giants when you look for jobs. Quite a few are known for successfully squeezing all 6-7 of their students into industry and administration immediately after graduation.\n\nIt seems the best stories come from people who knew the lab working environment, research team and supervisor personally before starting their proposed project. For me, after much consideration, I realized moving to UK without knowing the supervisor and their work ethic personally is too big of a risk for me. I have a First class Honours which qualifies me to take the direct PhD route but I also want to tailor my PhD to a supervisor and field properly and I don't really have time for that atm. Excellent results will open the door for you but you'll need to prove your passion by getting involved in relevant research projects if you want to keep that door open. I'm applying for a Masters instead and looking into 1+3 programmes because I want more experience and knowledge before moving on.\n\nFor you, if you feel ready, start getting involved as an intern or research assistant, network with your professors and see if they can help you find projects and research jobs. If you've made grant proposals and received grants for projects in the past, that'd be beneficial too. Shadow someone you admire in your field, connect on LinkedIn, see what academic or career decisions they made to get to where they are. Get really good marks (80% and above is the usual reference). Then you'll have to select a university, see what PhD projects are available, check the funding status and email the relevant PIs. After connecting to them, you can figure out if you want to apply with your own research project (you might have to apply for grants and the PI will help), or apply for an existing project.

What makes me unique (as far as \"inspirational\" stories goes) is that I really had no medical issues, (serious) familial problems, nor did I have social problems. I was a very happy, healthy teenager. But I was not at all interested in my education, and I had no plans to pursue my academics beyond a high school diploma. I rarely did homework, took the easiest possible classes, and even managed to get an \"F\" in ceramics.\n\nSo I was at a party a few months after my class graduated and a bunch of my friends were talking about their upcoming classes at the local community college and asked if I had registered, I said I hadn't, and they laughed at me and asked if I was going to work in fast food for the rest of my life. To be honest, I wasn't unhappy working fast food and playing PC games so I was really offended at the principle of her question - I didn't see a problem with my lifestyle. Regardless, when I got home that night I registered for classes out of spite, completely hammered at 3am.\n\nI started going to community college the next month, and challenged myself by taking a philosophy classes and an honor's writing course. I got a B+ and A- but more importantly, I had a lot of fun, and I noticed it gave my life some purpose during the existentially terrifying, early-adulthood \"there is an infinite void of time in front of me\" phase. So I kept taking classes. \n\nEventually I hit a wall at college algebra (basically Algebra 2 from high school). I really never learned algebra, nor did I really learn how to learn math. So I failed the class. Then I passed it. Then I failed the next math class (basically precalculus). Then I failed that class again. Had some issues with STEM courses at first, but I really loved them. Then I hit an absolute wall in my personal life and dropped all of my classes outright to preserve my GPA. \n\nAfter a summer of deep self-loathing and depression, I recommitted to my education, pursuing a degree in chemical engineering. I got straight As in my next sixteen classes, completing the transfer degree with decent GPA (\\~3.4), then transferred to a decently respected state engineering university. After formative half-decade which included a few internships and REUs, I graduated with a GPA of around 3.7 and immediately got a job as a process engineer.

I'm not sure where you are but it's a scheme in the UK that if there's places left on the course, you can be offered a place even if you didn't get the grades. I didn't even do very well in my undergraduate degree, not typically what you would need in the UK to do a PhD.

I graduated in 2019. \n\nBUT, that's my story and what I will say to you is that you are only in junior high. Right now, at 16 years of age, you are not capable of doing a PhD so do not get yourself caught up in what you aren't *yet* capable of and work on what you are capable of doing now. You will spend the next 5+ years getting yourself ready for a PhD programme but please remember to enjoy your life. Get yourself to university, get tutors and extra support where you need it. Once you're in university, take classes that support your plans and in your 3rd year look for research or lab experience, speak with advisors and seek advice from them. It might be necessary to do a Masters too. But you are still a while away from all of this so do not let it consume you. You *can* be capable but academic research/PhD is a completely different beast from where you're at now.

I've seen it in myself and the people around me - I was an above average student in primary school, mediocre in middle school, and then improved in high-school and even more so in university. Although, this can partially be explained by how different phases of the education system test different academic aspects (rote learning vs problem solving vs ability to express oneself vs pressure from parents...), another large factor is that people (including you) get better or worse academically as they progress in life.\n\nNow, it's important to realize that it's not enough to wait around and hope you will improve. What's important is to take active steps towards improving your academic ability. The first step is consistency. Academics is a marathon not a sprint. If you study just a little bit harder everyday, you might not see the difference immediately but in a couple years the compound interest on that studying will pay off. However, it's also important to realize that it's also really beneficial to question how you study. You want to be as effective as possible when studying. Effective studying is not rereading the textbook as many times as possible, it's also not doing as many exercises as possible. Strategies for being an efficient learner exist. One such strategy, spaced repetition, is to try and review material you struggle with more often then material you don't have trouble with. ANKI is a popular flashcard app that implements spaced repetition which can be effective for rote learning.\n\nFinally, it's also really important to realize that academics is only one small component of life. It might seem really important right now because you are in school where students are constantly being compared on academics, but when you get into adulthood it often doesn't seem anywhere near as important.   \n\n\nHere are some links to make you think about how to improve your studying habits:\n\n[http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck) (blog post about the importance about perspective when learning)\n\nMake it stick by Peter C.

If you try and do a half/half situation, then no one is going to be happy, as you'll still be stressed and your partner will not get to spend quality time with you.\n\nAlso, it's not a healthy situation where you're wondering whether to prioritise yourself (job) or your partner.

I also believe that alot of the successful academics have either never experienced mental health problems or believe that as they managed to overcome theirs, that others should do the same.\n\nFurthermore, supervisors rely on PhD students to generate results/papers. Many will probably see 'underachieving' students as a waste of finances. Since there are always more PhD applicants than available PhD's, this perpetuates the emphasis of the PhD student being amazing and contributing alot, while the supervisor doesn't have to be as supportive/hands-on.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pl1ihw/advisor_is_oblivious_to_their_flaws/hc7a1p1/"}, "1838": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Sad-Ad-6147", "Date": 1631207027, "Score": 4, "Body": "If you're okay with online recruitment, I'd suggest two options: \n\n1.

What you could say is something like, \"I have seen these issues up close and appreciate the impact on individuals and communities.\" This can be true. You can cite news articles or other stories about people with similar struggles and say that they resonate with you.\n\nWhat is your goal with the personal statement?  I would argue that your goal *should* be to maximize your chances of getting into a program where you can do the impactful research you want to do.  Because that's what the statement is for and all that anyone is ever going to read it to do.  As soon as you're in, you can change directions, shift gears, etc etc.\n\nThe personal statement is not an op-ed, an advocacy piece, a twitter thread, a research article,  etc etc. Any piece of writing should be written with the reader in mind. What is the reader looking for? The reader in this case is evaluating candidates for admission. What does a successful candidate look like? Well, you can define success in various ways. But how does the department define success? What metrics do they have?  The department probably looks at things like 1) completing coursework, 2) passing quals, 3) doing research/supporting faculty with research, 4) writing and publishing papers on that research, 5) presenting at conferences, 6) winning grants, and 7) graduating in a timely manner.\n\nI'm not saying that definition of success is right or wrong, or should/shouldn't be different, or that there should/shouldn't be other supports/resources available.  What I *am* saying is that that is probably how the department defines success. Consider the perspective of the assistant professor up for tenure in 3-4 years (the reader!) who would collaborate with this student; if they spend research funds and time mentoring a student who needs a leave of absence (delaying the project), it will affect their ability to get tenure. Who is that assistant prof who needs an RA going to pick?\n\nSo that leads us to the question. Will including information about personal mental health struggles increase or decrease your chances of getting in?\n\n**Potential upsides**\n\n* Many faculty also struggle with mental health issues, so they might see a kindred spirit in you\n* Could convey resiliency/perseverance\n* It might help you seem more passionate about your topic\n\n**Potential downsides**\n\n* Faculty could worry that your mental health will impact your ability to succeed against the metrics they have\n\nThen consider that it's not an objective ranking. It is you versus the other candidates who are all motivated, highly qualified, and passionate.\n\nA final note, re:\n\n&gt;Given that DEI is a commonly purported value of universities, there needs to be more attention to how mental health disabilities manifest as a symptom of oppression, not as a sign of individual weakness\n\nMany universities are really working on this. As a personal example, one area that I can directly impact is the financial burden of my class, so I personally spent hundreds of hours developing online course notes so that my students wouldn't have to buy a textbook (and of course, they work with screenreaders etc). I record lectures, have no mandatory attendance, give unlimited extensions without requiring a justification, send text message reminders about assignments, etc etc. I'm doing everything I can with the resources I have while honestly making very little money. Many many people are working really hard on these issues.  Be careful not to lecture the faculty on the admissions committee about them because a) you might get someone who is doing all they can and already believes in this and doesn't deserve to have someone tell them they need to do more or b) it could be perceived as an argument \"let me in to advance your DEI efforts.\"", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/plsot9/i_know_the_usual_advice_is_that_you_shouldnt_talk/hcd2sl2/"}, "2187": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Veridici", "Date": 1631310071, "Score": 2, "Body": "What fields will suit you will depend entirely on what your background is.

I'm just about to go into my final year and can say that I emphasise with what you're feeling. I lost alot of my passion for my PhD after the first three months, which for me was down to a lack of supervision, rather than a loss of interest. However, I now feel a desire to move out of academia as I cannot stand the bureaucracy that exists in this sector and that the emphasis is really not on research, but just on how you're perceived. I have heard that cancer research is quite a 'hostile' field as it's so relevant, while other biological fields (developmental, neuro, protein) are much more laid back - this probably exacerbates the bureaucracy that exists in this field.\n\nMy opinion on this is that a PhD is a long journey and requires you to motivate yourself. If you're already feeling so disinterested after the first 2 weeks, I think you need to consider whether it's a PhD overall that you don't enjoy (lab work, etc), or the field/project you're in.

Worth looking into). But I\u2019m with you on concerns around going to Oxford from a working class background - I went to a prestigious university for my PhD after studying at a much less prestigious place and boy did I feel the imposter syndrome. But I recognise that it was mainly just in my head - literally nobody there doing a PhD alongside me cared about where I came from, we were all in it together and it really didn\u2019t matter about our backgrounds. Those people from Oxford included! You\u2019ve got to take the prestige on the chin and realise you\u2019re there because of merit.\n\nGo to an open day and get a feel for it and see what you think :) but don\u2019t let your working class background put you off getting what you want - you\u2019ll do great wherever you go!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pn2hpc/advice_seeking/hcokcb0/"}, "2599": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bmt32", "Date": 1631537381, "Score": 2, "Body": "I think it depends on the text. I can read a lot more of a novel in a day than I can theory, for example.\n\nMy biggest advice as someone who is near to finishing: you can't read everything, particularly when in coursework. Instead of killing yourself trying, develop your ability to read strategically and find things to say in class around what you did read. This is true for Quals too--I think I only read 2/3 of my lists all the way through.\n\nETA: another tip for coursework, especially for classes with a heavy reading load, is to split up the assignments among your peers in the class (like, half read x and half read y, and each group is responsible to \"carry\" the discussion of their text in class). \n\nYOU are not a failure for not being able to read everything; faculty often assign unreasonable workloads.

I'd be on campus until 3am but stare at the same code I wrote 4 months ago, changing names of variables and adding comments because  \"at least I am doing something\". I did this with writing my literature review. I think I made like 9 drafts of that thing! Then I had a super break down, and had to take a leave of absense for over a year. But because I had lived in a perpetual state of anxiety overload almost 2/3 years, I felt I couldn't just quit and went back. Apparently the break was what I needed because after I came back, I somehow finished the final bit in 4 months (lol I literally had completely all my analysis, experimental work and about 70% of my thesis when I \"gave up\". I had pushed through quite far while feeling mentally exhausted). I liked my research but it ended up being a monster to me and there are still lingering effects (granted I have only submitted 6 months ago but yeah, still pretty upset, could have finished in 4 years instead I took 6). Overload turns to imposter syndrome turns into more anxiety and self hating.

From your post, it's clear that you can acknowledge the positives in your PhD (large research group, great supervisors, you have not fallen behind despite practical difficulties (e.g. Covid / distance learning)), but you still carry doubts about your abilities and whether or not you even belong on the course.  \n\n\nI would say that if you can focus for a couple of hours at a time you're doing well. I work in an office with several PhD students and you are tearing them a new belly button with regards to focusing time. But overall, it seems that the person holding up the yardstick by which all things should be measured, so, the person who is making you feel bad, is you. At no point have you said that your supervisors or colleagues are critical of your work, contributions or approach. It's only you. So I would say - go easy on yourself. Be your own best friend, your most vocal supporter, and not your most vocal critic. You can't learn it all, you can't be an expert in a field being so early in your research career. Nobody expects you to be either. You may not be as good as some, but you're better than most. Try to be okay with that if you can.  \n\n\nI am a mature student and I did not do as well as my colleagues at school (they are SO smart it makes your teeth itch), plus its harder for me to take in information at my age, my colleagues can understand and act on things so much quicker than I can. I spent 6 years applying for PhD places and failed with every one. In the end, I lucked into my place, through a series of circumstances too long and boring to describe. I shouldn't be here, by rights. It was all just luck. So I feel you when it comes to confidence and imposter syndrome. But you know what? This journey is so individual, that you should try and accept that they're doing their thing, and you're doing yours. I know my colleagues are smarter than me, but I'm still doing good work, and at the end of this we'll all have the same 3 letters after our name regardless.  \n\n\nYou can do this, absolutely. Because you've come this far. The admissions committee know their stuff. With respect, they know more than you about who can do things and who can't. And they believe you can. And that's why you're there. Ideas for your thesis will come. Read around, talk to people (especially those from different disciplines), bounce things around a bit. Even podcasts or twitter, things that don't feel particularly academic, can be inspirational. You will get there. Please don't quit, because you can smash this, and it will change your life for the better. You are in a position that many would kill for. Don't let a lack of self-confidence defeat you, tell yourself that you deserve all you have and more regardless of what your inner voice is saying. Accept that you will have days of crushing defeat, but other days will be better, and some days will be amazing. Acknowledge when things are good, accept when things are bad. I guarantee that the people you think are doing so well feel the same as you. I would put money on it. So talk to them too, be humble and admit you're struggling. You'll find relief and perhaps some humour in sharing your feelings.

I've never seen a German work overtime. If contract says 40h/week, that's what it's gonna be, even if they have no badge to check hours.

I think there are a few myths when it comes to radicalization, especially due to the sensationalized nature of the phenomenon within the media and within politics. The first is that there is often this assumption that radicalization is something that is well defined. The definition of radicalization is often heavily debated and is something that changes through time to accommodate the goals of the ruling class. Outside of radicalization being a process there is not a lot that is agreed upon within the literature. There is also this assumption with radicalization that it insinuates violence, which once again isn\u2019t true. While it is true that extremists have often co-opted violence as a tool for furthering the ideological agendas, this isn\u2019t an inherent quality of those who have been radicalized. It is entirely possible for one to be consider a radical and simultaneously practice pacifism. Gandhi would be a good example of this, but perhaps a more concrete example would be individuals in North Korea who advocate for free speech. As free speech is a non-normative position in North Korea, those individuals advocating for it would likely be considered extremists or radicals by the North Korean government. \n\nOther items worth mentioning is that there is an irrational fear in most countries of foreigners regarding extremist violence or terrorism, when in actual fact it is often naturally born citizens of a particular nation that carry out extremist acts of violence or terrorism. Case and point, the largest terrorist organization within the United States is the KKK. The KKK are not labeled as a terrorist organization within the US however, due to the non-sensical law which states that terrorist organizations can only come from outside of the US... if a law were to be created that recognizes domestic terrorist groups like the KKK or the Aryan Brotherhood, it would literally make the association with these groups illegal.

If anything, a mature acceptance that you're not right for the PhD probably looks better than someone who scraped through and only did it for the piece of paper at the end.\n\nAs another commenter said, it feels like this is a massive decision which will affect the rest of your life but it probably isn't.

I also find my supervisor very unhelpful. She gives me very regular meetings but I find she just doesn't understand the basics of what I'm working on.

Of course I don't know how much I can generalize my conclusions. \n\nEven for the most draining experiences that I had in industry, there were some major differences compared to academia. \n\nFirst, in industry I was always expected to be part of a team, constantly interacting with other people. During my PhD, even though I'm still part of a team, the amount of interaction with other people is much lower, and I'm expected to become an independent researcher (so, often doing things by myself). This increases disconnection. \n\nSecond, while working in industry, even if I'm extremely busy, people can understand. But usually people have a hard time understanding why someone would spend so many hours \"just being a student,\" \"just reading papers,\" or something like that. A lot of people don't believe doing a PhD is hard work, they don't believe that doing a PhD can be harder than a \"real job\". This also increases disconnection, and it's easy to feel nobody understand us. \n\nThird, while working in industry, I constantly had results to show, usually positive ones. Otherwise, I would lose my job. But, as a professor here said and I often repeat, failure is the standard for academic research. Not only things take a long time, they often end in failure. Our experiments fail, our hypotheses fail, our methods don't work, our papers are rejected, our research ideas are shot down, our funding requests are denied, etc. Working so hard, for such a long time, often on a single project, only to have nothing to show at the end can drain anyone. \n\nAs a PhD student, there is also the concern about what is going to happen next. The stress of not knowing what's going to happen with our lives after we graduate. How long the PhD will take? Will we get a job? In academia or industry? In which country? Under which conditions? We know this is temporary, and the future is uncertain. In industry, even if there is some level of uncertainty about the future, it's not like doing a PhD. We usually have some goals in mind, like getting a promotion, and changes are not so random. \n\nAnd, of course, all of that can be affected positively or negatively by the advisor and department.

I did an academic postdoc, and left academia after 6 years.\n\nI had come straight out of college, liked science, and decided to pursue it further because it was all paid for (in biological sciences, US program). It really just came down to that. It wasn't a battle about academia, or any of the politics that come alongside with it, or about fame or fortune. \n\nI just wanted to do cool shit, and I learned you can lead a project. That was fun. Things like job prospects I worried about my 4th year or so when deciding to do an academic postdoc (wanted to be a professor, didn't pan out that way but got my fill of things).\n\nI imagine that if you're coming from biotech or the working world and then going into a program, you're comparing yourself to your superiors or those above you. The PhDs call the shot, you might not see them, and they're in this echelon above. But it's comfortable: maybe people tell you what to do. Maybe you figure out small problems on getting something to work. So identity there is as an employee where you're learning. \n\nPhD though has no distinct end, and things are not structured. You're expected to come up with a project, work through said project, and have it get to completion. There's no checklist. And because the metrics are all over the place, you have nothing to gauge it by.\n\nYou work harder and harder without any frame of reference, letting everything else slip by.\n\nI don't think I had those problems because I wasn't worrying so much about the projects finishing and it affecting whether I was \"worthy\" of being a PhD.  I think it also helped that I was drinking with my boss and committee, and they treated me like equals. And I was seeing myself learning perspective over that time. I wasn't in a huge rush.\n\nThe postdoc was different, where I was treated like trash and refused to believe that was right.\n\nI will say this, the other difference with the working world is that true professionalism is very refreshing. My first job out of my postdoc was a supervisor that was very professional, and while frustrating to work with, there were distinct metrics that were codified to ensure I was doing the job correctly.\n\nI can't tell you to *not* think of your PhD as an identity (I've seen so many topics about imposter syndrome at this point that I'm wondering if people really even know what it means). Maybe it's because I'm used to failing along the way so that being wrong doesn't scare me? I don't really know. But it may help to realize that what makes you a strong scientist or researcher isn't being right, but about being able to ask the right questions and, invariably, learning when being wrong.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ppi2uq/is_feeling_like_a_sad_lonely_shell_of_your_former/hd4m5ei/"}, "3286": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "burntoutgradstudent", "Date": 1631826715, "Score": 2, "Body": "Congrats!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ppfhxl/viva_day_vday_today_at_noon/hd4n32k/"}, "3287": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "muslay", "Date": 1631827123, "Score": 1, "Body": "So, is there any potential to extend human age over 100 years for example ?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ppe2no/what_are_some_examples_of_misdisinformation/hd4o12o/"}, "3288": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "phdemented", "Date": 1631827651, "Score": 2, "Body": "One for my school, and that was it.

I really think the next time the PostDoc says something about you leaving the lab at 5pm, you need to say something to them. Tell them frankly, but nicely, that you've completed all the experimental work for the day and have to attend to grading and studying, especially since both reflect on how you're viewed by the department. I'm not sure it's the same where you are, but in my department doing well with the TA and proctoring assignments was included as part of my annual review and affected which classes I would be assigned to. Your coursework is also very important to do well in, because the graduate student courses tend to be much more detailed and relevant to the work you're doing in the lab - those will provide the solid foundation that you have to have in order to make your own hypotheses related to your project. \n\n\nI'll also speak to your point on the PI and being the only other person in the lab soon, because that has the potential to become even MORE stressful. This is regardless of whether or not your PI does any experiments. I was also the only other person in the lab for nearly two years, and my PI also had an expectation of multiple publications before graduating. Our work also included cell culture and some mouse work, which takes a lot more time to complete than, say, testing new drugs on bacterial cultures. Luckily I had completed my coursework by this time, and they switched me to an RA for two semesters, but it was extremely stressful. My PI was in the lab every day, even weekends, also doing benchwork and grant writing, so I had no way of taking a break without hearing about it from them. While I did come out of it with 7 publications, 5 first author, I very nearly quit on multiple occasions. So taking from my past, I'm very concerned that you'll be dealing with the same on top of your coursework and TA duties. I would strongly recommend you have an open and honest discussion about what the PostDoc leaving will mean for you, because you are not a PostDoc yet and should not be expected to do the work of one. Stress that you have these other duties outside the lab and make sure it's clear they understand this.\n\nAs a last question, why is the PostDoc leaving? Did they get a faculty or industry job elsewhere because their PostDoc contract is up? Or are they burnt out? Why is there no one else in the lab? Those are potential red flags that you may want to consider. If things don't improve, you may consider switching to another lab with a better lab environment, and it's much easier to do this earlier in the program. It's not impossible or even unheard of after you pass all your quals, but it is much more difficult.\n\nIf you have any questions, need advice, or need a stranger to rant to, please DM me or post here again.

Disclaimer: N=1, am professor so have survival bias. \n\nFirst, the job market in academia for history and anthropology is horrendous. Check out Figure 3 in this article from AHA ([https://www.historians.org/ahajobsreport2021](https://www.historians.org/ahajobsreport2021)) to see how the creation of history PhDs outpaces demand and this 2018 article that estimates that \\~79% of anthro grads do not get TT jobs in the US ([https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202528](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202528)) Granted, it may be somewhat easier (than that) to get contingent or adjunct work in history/anthropology but you should know that it is still very very competitive and adjunct work alone is generally poorly paid exploitative labor (I know some fields like nursing might be paid better, but we're talking humanities here) and not livable on its own. You haven't said what your goals are in academia, so just wanted to lay this out.\n\nSo, if you're very determined to be a full-time professor (TT or NTT) your best shot (which still might not be a great shot) is to go to a tippy-top top program, pick a marketable specialty, and be productive as hell in winning money/publishing papers/networking. Having to be the very best of all time (in order to be competitive) makes having a full-time job very difficult. Many graduate students do work, at least part-time, because they need the money. That is why I worked in graduate school myself. But universities generally counsel against it (unless it is useful to your research or career goals) and some even have rules prohibiting you from working more than a certain amount or at all. So I myself worked full-time in graduate school and can say that it made graduate school very hard. It might seem easy to balance a job and courses in theory, but in a PhD program it is not that simple. In graduate school basic compliance with the program might get you a PhD, but it is unlikely to get you a full-time academic job because of the inflated resume expectations for entry level candidates (monographs, papers, awards, grants etc). I am sitting on a search committee now for a new hire in a social science and we are seeing folks with 12-20 papers coming in entry-level.\n\nI would second other posters in advising folks to never do a research PhD that is not funded. Personally, I consider that to be predatory behavior by the University because they are getting your teaching labor and your research accomplishments for free or for a fee. Be sure to get information about job placement rates and see if their outcomes match up with your goals.\n\nThe amount of effort you are putting into your studies is admirable, but I would caution that an AA is not likely to tell you if you'll like or succeed in a PhD program because the goals of those courses of study are different. The PhD is a research degree where the currency of success is highly impactful novel original research and grant funding. I know you may have more experience with research in your MA, depending on if it was a course-based or research-based masters, but this is something to keep in mind.\n\nAt my own current and past institutions the curricular demands of humanities programs included 2-3 years of class or so, TAing/teaching/RAing for most semesters unless you brought in external funding, and completion times ranged from 6-8 years on average. \n\nAgain, just my thoughts and experiences.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pqo4rs/deleted_by_user/hdct2pd/"}, "3641": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SubcooledBoiling", "Date": 1631986753, "Score": 15, "Body": "Unrelated but one time my adviser was on the committee of someone whose thesis was 500+ pages long and he didn't enjoy the experience.\n\nAlso, good luck with your feedbacks and defense", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pqokmo/got_feedback_for_my_phd_thesis/hdctasq/"}, "3642": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "chaosisblond", "Date": 1631986793, "Score": 15, "Body": "Yeah, mine was on the shorter side for my department, and it was like 212 pages (or 221, I don't remember at this point).

This prof was a successful scholar who completed his PhD in a renown program a generation ago.

If you can't, then set aside 3 hours on your off day (preferably early) to get only the most important things done. Then you have a solid 15 hours of free time.

If you didn't build the rapport when you were a student, of course it's much hard to do that with a cold approach out of the blue.

You don't just ask for a recommendation, you first need to show the professor would be right to bet on you.

So our routine is usually to have dinner together while talking about the day, watching something together a few times a week, and trying to do something social together on weekends. We of course do grocery shopping and some other chores together as well. \n\nCommunication seems most key. Letting my spouse know what I've got going in my schedule and intentionally making time for her has done wonders so far. Jotting notes to stuff in her lunch or on the nightstand when I go to bed (I stay up way later than her!) tends to do wonders for her happiness. But communication goes beyond my needs. It's also asking what she needs help with and if she wants to make plans when I'm between assignments and have the free time available. \n\nI'd point out it won't be like this for the entire PhD. From everyone I've spoken to, it seems like the first year is the hardest as you adjust to your department, settle in to your classes, and figure out a routine for whatever research/teaching requirements you have to satisfy for your stipend. The second year is a little harder as you finish classes, form a committee, and submit a research plan. Supposedly after that it is challenging because your research is challenging, but gets at least some of the other stresses from taking classes, etc. go away. \n\nI don't think the 9-5 advice really works, but there is a schedule like for 10 hours of work in a day that will. Set tasks for yourself every day, either through a calendar or an app or a journal, and make sure you're planning how you'll accomplish each task. Be purposeful about what you commit to doing for each class you take or teach in. Don't spend time doing something that makes you feel productive but doesn't measurably improve your performance in your coursework, etc. \n\nYou (and your spouse) will get through this, just recognize that this is a phase of the program.

I think you might be over-simplifying what AI engineering is about.\n\nIf you're interested in algorithm design you should also try reading some papers published from top AI conferences and see if those problems are ones that you're  still interested in. As examples there is Neurips, AAAI, CVLR etc.  And not to put you down or anything, but the work required to get into one of those positions is quite competitive. Even at big companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, the majority of people, even ones with PhDs in ML, are working on some applied side of things, very few people are actually working on research. The old days of Xerox park and MSR are long gone, most teams are tied to a product anyways.  And being on the research team also comes with different expectations you should be aware of, as an example, you might be required to publish and present at conferences very frequently and to have ties with academic institutions.\n\nWhereas being on the applied side of things do offer a lot more flexibility, and there are a lot of interesting problems to solve too. Some of it is algorithm development, some of it is integrating, some of it is product building. There's far more opportunities too. I think one of the best part about the engineering is that you get to see the 'bigger picture' of what you're working on, and usually you're closer to seeing how it impacts users too.

We (researchers) are all people who have bad days during our work and may or may not make mistakes during our work. Some can be caught early on and fixed. Some simply follow through to a paper.

But I don't regret doing a PhD, you are very free in the research you do and it's a special lifestyle you will not find in industry. Also a doing a PhD can allow you to travel to another country and live there for a few years and experience other cultures. Which is also harder to achieve otherwise. In general doing a PhD for money is stupid, doing it for the experience and gaining independence and skills is better. I think a PhD is a personal achievement and should be treated a such, it requires a sacrifice and will not give you a lot of results in \"the real world\" but it's a unique experience.

This normally happens if (a) the student is really struggling and is barely passing, and (b) the advisor really has no continued interest in supporting the student. That second part sounds harsh, but keep in mind that if a student is going to be far more of an investment than is worth (e.g. there's other students, the quality of the work will hurt, etc.), getting them out as soon as possible rather than wasting their time is ideal.\n- Most people that I know that have left happened after the qualifying exam. One student had threatened their advisor repeatedly, and he just was done with it. Most others though simply aren't showing any progress (e.g. don't show up to work, don't have any data to progress further, are just wholly incompetent). They usually should have failed the the qualifying exam, but oftentimes their advisors are trying to save them/need them to work in their labs. There's a lot of sunken cost that goes on here.\n- There is a cohort of people that stay just way too fucking long. That can happen because (a) projects don't work out, (b) advisors don't work out. I'm aware you can sometimes take a leave of absence, but I don't honestly know how this fares with most students if you try this.

Even if it remotely seems like it's within your wheelhouse, just apply to a position regardless. You can reliably send in perhaps 5 applications a day (usually these things should be pretty formulaic at this point).\n- Resumes should be tailored to the job you're applying for.\n- Getting interviews is the first step. If you're not getting interviews for jobs, it likely means your resume and/or cover letter are not standing out. Do not rely on just saying \"I have a PhD\" to make it do that for you; your cohort are ALSO applying for these positions.\n- Interviews themselves should be reflective of your ability. But you should be ready for common interview questions in your back pocket (these can be found online pretty easily). [The STAR method of answering questions is often seen as a reliable way of going through the interview.](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)\n- When looking for jobs, do not only look for those that exactly match your criteria. Additionally, you may either not be qualified or underqualified for the research project manager or research associate roles.\n- Don't be afraid to look outside of your field or your area. You may have to bend to this to be able to land a job to gain experience and then work your way to a more desirable position.\n\nThe PhD itself is *not* a magic ticket to getting a job. I think that's the mistake some people make regarding their degree. You *are* qualified, but it's the experiences within the PhD that are of the most value. If your PhD experience is more limited, then your job opportunities will also be limited.\n\nIf you truly do have project management experience, then your resume should reflect that strength, as well as the successes you quantifiably have had.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ps8o9o/getting_rejected_from_every_job_ive_applied_for/hdq9j8e/"}, "4106": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "NattyKhala", "Date": 1632239442, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank you for your reply!

It\u2019s the stuff from the commercial side of archaeology which makes up about 90% of the work these days. This shit gets \u2018published\u2019 on random sites, in certain \u2018archives\u2019 or in government reports, essentially useless documents that are hundreds of pages of descriptions of shit that are super hard to get a hold of. \n\nThe second side is the scientific side.

Universities are usually given a certain number of funded studentships to disperse amongst prospective PhD students. These tend to be competitive, so you will most likely need to be interviewed and submit transcripts during the application process. If your application was strong enough for the university to give you an offer, you should stand a reasonable chance of obtaining funding. If you are an exceptionally strong candidate, there are usually various scholarships available which provide funding. You should note that the academic requirements for funding may, in some cases, be different from these required to obtain an offer, so it's important to look into this carefully. \n\nPhD funding usually comes in one of two types: doctoral training partnerships (DTPs) and centres for doctoral training (CDTs). DTPs tend to provide a straight stipend and tuition fees to fund you to undertake your research program in the way you and your supervisor see fit. With this option, you would essentially go straight into PhD research. CDTs are slightly different. A stipend and tuition fees are still provided, but instead of going straight into PhD research, you would start off by undertaking several months of training and lectures in your research area. Both routes have their merits, but it's important to research each one carefully to select the option that is right for you.

Maybe an indicator that weights the position in the author list when accounting citations could be more accurate.\n\nAnother issue is the field, or even the scope. Across field citation numbers are hugely disproportionately. If a medical researcher sees the CV of a literature researcher it will probably laugh his ass off. But scope or type of research is also influential. In my field, ecology and evolution, four type of articles are the hugely cited (that comes to my mind now): First, methodological articles. They describe a field or statistical method, or a package or software. Second, reviews of a broad topic, theory or model. Third, descriptions of a broad pattern that many people will need to cite when writing about the topic. For example, the resolved phylogenetic tree of a group will be cited in a ton of articles about the group. And finally, ground breaking research that push what's \"fashionable\" a little closer to the field of the article. \n\nIf you ask me, the ones that show more the research capability is the last one, ground breaking research.

First, **it only really applies to PhDs in the US**. It should be titled \"Why pursuing a PhD in the US is a Nightmare?\". Second, (and more importantly), this puts the onus completely on the person seeking the PhD. The fact is, the environment someone does a PhD in will be a better indicator of whether or not someone succeed. This article reads as though it's saying \"you need to be a special kind of person to be successful in a PhD\" instead of the much more significant \"you need to make sure you're in the right environment to do a PhD\". \n\nThe biggest giveaway is a minor language quirk, but it's one that irritated the fuck out of me when I was visiting friends and family back in the US, \"PhD Student\". I don't call myself a student. Most of my colleagues don't call themselves students. My supervisor doesn't call me a student. My university doesn't call me a student. The country I live in doesn't consider my a student (I have a work visa - this is common for non-EU PhD candidates in the EU). Instead we're called \"candidates\", because we're far more employees than students.\n\nThat little language quirk carries a meaningful difference. Students are often exploited (even in the EU). Employees in the EU on the other hand have protections, they have rights. The TAs for the classes I teach have more vacation time than most PhD students would have in the states (given that they actually have legally guaranteed vacation hours). Students often have the mindset of \"suffer now for a payoff later\". I know I did when I was a student - an all nighter was a semi-regular occurrence. I'd never give my PhD (or any other job for that matter), the same level of dedication. It's just not worth it. Very few of my EU colleagues would be willing to work on weekends or after hours (with very few exceptions). Meanwhile, this appears to be a common occurrence among US PhD students.\n\nThen there are these two questions:\n\n&gt; Can I withstand long years without a guaranteed/permanent job?\n\nMost PhD candidates in the EU have a work contract - it's basically guaranteed. After the first year (or 6 months depending on country/university), it's practically impossible to fire an employee. Since PhD contracts are temporary, most universities would rather someone finish than try kick them to the curb (because chances are they're going to fail at firing someone - or the process of firing someone is cost/time prohibitive and it's genuinely a better option to just let them finish their contract). So this doesn't apply to most of us in the EU.\n\n&gt; Do I have the luxury to survive on a scholarship?\n\nAgain, work contract. It's a salary for those of us in the EU.\n\nWhich brings me to a greater point, **it's not supposed to be this great struggle**. I genuinely don't know how or why someone would get a PhD in the US. I genuinely feel bad for PhD candidates in the US. That's not in a \"I pity you\" sense or a \"hahaha sucks to suck\" sense, but a \"I am watching friends almost kill themselves for something that **should be just a fucking job**\" sense. \n\nYou want to know how to not have a nightmarish experience? \n\n# Find a place where you can actually treat it like a job\n\nThis is possible in the US, but it's rare. Most universities don't give PhD candidates a contract, instead insisting on calling them students. Most universities won't give PhD candidates real time off (most jobs in the US doesn't do that either, but that's a different discussion). Work-life balance can't be consideration unless the thing you spend most of your waking hours doing is actually \"work\". It shouldn't be a luxury to be able to treat your job as a job.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ptjydy/why_pursuing_phd_is_a_nightmare/hdzdby2/"}, "4511": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Dearnishi", "Date": 1632415828, "Score": 9, "Body": "Don\u2019t be .

Will you know everything by the end, and stop saying stupid things in lab meetings? Certainly not. In my field a PhD is, for all intents and purposes, entry level qualification for R&amp;D jobs, or a jump off point to the academic ladder. That's it. You get a cool title for somewhat interesting historical reasons, but beyond that your goal should just be to learn. No one expects you to be very good at anything, really, just that you show up the next day and try again. That's the only way anyone has ever found to improve, and a PhD is essentially a codified structure of essentially guaranteed sequential opportunities to fail and learn from your mistakes. Every time something goes wrong or you think people are judging you, you can be guaranteed that in a different situation they would do the same. People higher up in the hierarchy have just ingrained this into their personality; the aura of \"I know what I'm doing\" is, I believe, just a representation of the underlying \"I know that whatever happens, we will all learn from it and move towards our goals\".

Also, it makes it appear like I have a problem with people. I mostly feel sorry for people who are working too much, I'm not mad at them. I am mad at US institutions that force PhD students into genuinely unhealthy working environments.\n\nMy alma mater in the US is such that 50% of ASE (Academic Student Employees - which includes as a significant makeup PhD students) are food insecure and 30% are housing insecure. I have a big problem with that. Obviously my issue is not with the people struggling.\n\n&gt; but the fact is I enjoy pouring everything I have into research. It energizes me and makes me feel alive.\n\nNo.\n\nI fully believe you love your job. I fully believe that you pour 100% of effort into your research and that you like doing it.\n\nIt is not healthy to make ANYTHING the entire basis of who you are. If you love something, great - but you literally can't do that 1 thing 100% of the time. It's unsustainable and it's unhealthy. I'm sure you can find famous counter examples (I know of one academic working on ALS researcher who literally has ALS - talk about a motivator). But that's not the norm, most people can't do that sustainably or even consistently. Even the ALS researcher only has 10ish years left before his ability to research is dramatically reduced (and his working capacity will reduce over those 10 years).\n\nEven things I genuinely love to do, my hobbies, I couldn't do 100% of the time. It's not healthy, even for the healthy hobbies. Regular rest and relaxation from work are really fucking important. Even if you love your job, I guarantee that taking a short break while working, a longer break every day, and a vacation a couple times a year will ultimately result in more, better output than just gunning it every minute of every day.\n\n&gt; it may affect competition for favorable positions in industry and academia.\n\n**You didn't seem to get what I was saying.** I have an issue with work environments that expect such a ridiculous level of dedication to work. They're shockingly common in the US, which is why I don't live there anymore. If a job expects applicants to be willing to work 10-20+ hours extra every week without extra salary, if it expects applicants to never take a vacation, then I'd argue that's a job not worth having.\n\nAnd to bring it back to the article - in order to do a PhD in the US, you have to be like you. You have to be willing to make research your life and give it 100% of your attention and effort.

You just need to take the time off 1/2 days a week to actually get the time to plan, process and recuperate. Make sure you have at least one day a week where you typically do absolutely nothing work related for your own sanity and health.\n\nAlso realize the positives of this situation. If you do a full-time PhD, your livelihood depends on your PI plus you have a huge resume gap if you would quit. If you work full-time and do PhD, they have no such power over you and you can take your work elsewhere if needed without risking your career and livelihood. Just make sure what you do now leads to publication within a reasonable span of time for public record. When I started my PhD I also pushed my PI for publication as soon as possible, this is mainly to protect yourself.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pvbwds/i_feel_like_im_missing_out/he9rmzl/"}, "4951": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nnomadic", "Date": 1632606816, "Score": 2, "Body": "Crypto has saved my ass in gradschool, I wont lie.

German bureaucracy lives up to is reputation of being very complex and very rigid: there are no exceptions and no workarounds, you just have to do everything exactly according to the rules, and those rules can be a bitch to figure out, especially when you're not fluent in German bureaucracy language. Also, most official administrations will not be able to help you in English\n\n\\- try to find out as soon as you can what the exact requirements are for graduating. There are some unusual graduation systems in Germany that I had never heard of anywhere else, such as an obligation to publish before obtaining your diploma (and therefore being allowed to call yourself doctor: I successfully defended last march I'm still not officially a doctor), or really weird defense systems (for my defense I had to prepare not only short presentations on my own dissertations, but also at least as many about subjects completely unrelated to my dissertation to prove that I had a well-rounded education...). This will depend on your university and faculty, but it\u2019s best to find out early so you are prepared and know what you are getting into\n\n\\- hierarchy in German universities is no joke. People don\u2019t address their professors by their first names unless in very particular cases. I did call my supervisor by his first name (mainly because I didn\u2019t realize at the time this wasn\u2019t normal) and he was fine with it (probably because he knew I was foreign and used to a different way of doing things), but other German students I talked to were absolutely SHOCKED by this. In emails especially, professors like to be addressed as \u201cSehr geehrter Herr/Frau Professor Lastname\u201d, at least the first time. Also, I actually had to explain to several German students that they were actually allowed to say no to their professors if they were asking too much or unreasonable things of them, this sometimes seemed to be an option that some of them had never even considered. This of course will totally depend on you supervisor (mine was actually great about all of this), but it\u2019s good to be aware off\n\n\\- German professors can be very blunt, harsh, and may be reluctant to give praise. A saying in some parts of Germany is that \u201csaying nothing bad is praise enough\u201d, so don\u2019t get too easily discouraged by critiques or a lack of praise. Also be aware of this when asking for letters of recommendation: some professors who are not as familiar with how those work internationally will write a very mediocre letter that is actually pretty critical of the student, thinking it is a positive letter because they don\u2019t always realize that in other countries anything less than glowing is typically seen as a bad letter\u00a0\n\nPlease don\u2019t get discouraged by all my discouraging comments. These are just some things that would have been good for me to know before going to Germany for my PhD. I don\u2019t know where you are from, so I don\u2019t know what you are used to. I just know that there were quite a few things that I wasn\u2019t used to when I arrived and that I had to learn to deal with. Of course, again all of this may be different for you depending on where you go and who you professors are, I just think it\u2019s good to be aware of stuff like this.\n\nOverall though, I really had a great time doing my PhD there, and I don\u2019t regret it even for a minute.

I'm currently in my final (6th) year of the PhD, plus 2 years for the MA before that.\n\nWhether it's the right choice depends on several factors, I think, that are very individual to each person. If you are interested in grad school, I would start with an MA and ONLY go somewhere that gives you a research or teaching assistantship (which should cover your tuition + a living stipend. It won't be much, my MA stipend was $14,000/year). But I would strongly recommend not going straight into a grad program from undergrad. Partly, this is because there are so many job options out there that don't require more than a BA; or you might find yourself becoming interested in a career that requires a non-English grad degree (a good friend who got her BA in English eventually decided to become a speech pathologist, requiring a masters in a totally different area). The other reason to wait is to get some \"real world\" work experience under your belt; should you get your masters and then not be able to get a job in your field or decide that's not actually what you want to do, it will be easier to transition with some work experience than with a higher degree and none. Grad school will also likely mean moving for at least 2 years, which leads to tricky questions in terms of your relationship (will your bf move with you? could you manage a distance relationship?). My now-husband and I did 2 years of long distance during my MA, and it was hard. Doable, but very hard. He moved with me for my PhD, but in doing so he had to move across the country, away from his family and friends, and give up a job he loved. I'm not saying \"throw away your dreams for a man,\" but it's no small thing you'd be embarking on and only you can decide if it's worth it.\n\nBut absolute bottom line: do NOT go to grad school if it means you'd go into debt (student loans, etc). I have too many friends and colleagues who are 10s if not 100s of thousands of $ in debt from student loans whose literal payoff plan is death (as in, they will never pay it off).

It worked out, and if you want, you can usually get a masters degree on the way. Given your financial situation, I advise this route. \n   1. a) Prioritize programs in smaller, more rural areas. Cornell, Indiana University, Illinois Urbana Champaign. Their stipends will normally be smaller than schools in cities, but it will go a lot further. Fully-funded masters programs are rare. For PhDs in science fields (in which I would count sociology), fully-funded will be the default for prestigious programs. I advise *only* doing a PhD if it is funded. \n2. Supervisor is tricky, because while there are \"good\" and \"bad\" advisors, it is also a lot about *chemistry*. That is, how well you can work with them. Generally, you should have some idea of who you want to work with when applying (based on research topic), though you can only know your chemistry with them after starting. Switching advisors is common, though the specifics of how this relates to funding will vary by department. \n3. Previous research experience is always desired for PhD programs, so I would advise searching for something in your undergrad. Some faculty in your program may even hire hourly paid research assistants, so ask around and see whats available where you are. Alternatively, look into REU programs, which I believe will usually fund you to go someplace and do research during the summer, though these are competative and will require travel.\n4.

So the comments you saw saying that going directly into a PhD is not common might not apply to you if you are in the US.  \r  \n\r  \nIn the US, the master is \"hidden\" in the PhD program through different requirements (course work, some formal evaluation after 1-2 years, etc.). Elsewhere, having a master degree is a requirement for entering most PhD programs. That's why the average PhD length is 5-7 years in the US compared to 3-4 years elsewhere. \n\nAlthough not common, you can still get into a PhD program outside of the US directly from undergrad, but only if you have very very good grades, relevant work experience and excellent letters of recommendation, both internally and externally. \r  \n\r\r\r  \nI am in this position and when I talk to PhD students in Canada and the EU/UK, they don't understand how it's possible that I went from a bachelor to a PhD (outside of the US) as it is not common, while when I talk to PhD students in the US they are in the same boat and there is nothing uncommon about my situation. The difference is that unlike them, I am truly skipping the master while they have to complete 1-2 more years to get their PhD due to how the programs are built over there (\"hidden master''). It's hard and very very rare to go around the \"hidden master\" requirements within the US PhD programs without already having a master degree (and even then, sometimes it's not possible), since it's basically \"hidden\". It would require you to get special permission to skip all the mandatory classes and coursework. \n\n&gt;Are there pros and cons to taking this route as opposed to doing a master\u2019s first? \n\n In countries where doing a PhD after your undergrad is not common, this is not really a question that can be asked unless you are one of the exceptions. So the following answer is in a US context. \n\nGood PhD positions are competitive, especially the ones that are fully funded with minimal TA/RA work required and at top or R1 universities. You should consider applying to master programs If you can't get into a good PhD program/the PhD program that you want. That's because a master will make you more competitive and increase your research experience.  You have to remember that you are not only in competition with US students but also with a lot of international students that already have a master because it's the normal path before a PhD in their country.  That's one of the reasons why some consider doing a master in the US before a PhD.   \n\nThen, there are some fields where you need a doctorate degree to legally practice such as psychology. These are sometimes called Professional doctorates in some countries. These fields work differently and they might or might not require a master degree and it might or might not be built inside the PhD program if it's required.

For each of the sections of your paper think of the sections you want and what citations may go together.  In an intro for example do the following.  Think of things as a funnel.  Start with the broadest part of the topic and with each paragraph or section be more specific.  I do immunology, protein biochem, and structural biochem.  So the way I arrange it is basically 1 why is it important and what is part the immune system doing overal.  2 What how do proteins act and with what.  3 what atomic information do we already know.  Now in an intro finally a paragraph with a summary above followed by what we wnt to acomplish and basically how but in the discussion do something similar as a conclusion.

Set an alarm and write... even if it is not good... at the end of a section or an hour or 2 take a break.  Then go again.  Getting stuff put down is hard, editing is hard and annoying but at least you have a skeleton.  Also, you have the citations as stuff you can talk about with your prof.

In the end I went with a place that has only one bedroom but the rent was substantially cheaper to allow me to save money. The only thing I had to keep in mind was that my partner would only be allowed to come live with me if the apartment had X square meters (the law stipulates a very small apt, so this was actually easy). However, I have heard that in Dublin, for example, getting a reasonable apartment can be crazy expensive so here goes already the first big difference between two countries in the EU.\n\nFortunately, health insurance can be extended to my partner without any extra cost so this is a big plus. In fact, depending on the income some people with a partner even managed to get extra discounts on health-related things.\n\nUnfortunately, because I am legally a student, my partner cannot legally work. So they are doing some \"gigs\" such as babysitting, they are also taking language courses and doing some online courses related to their field of study. I guess that being a post-doc would be different here and I suppose your partner would also be allowed to work normally (not sure though, you should double check with the embassy of the country you plan to go). Nevertheless, even with the correct visa type, finding work may be a struggle for your partner particularly if they don't speak the local language well enough. It is possible, but again it may vary wildly between countries. Finding a job only using English may be possible in the Netherlands but can be near impossible in France.\n\nA colleague of mine and their partner are also doing the same here and I have come to know other PhDs who have gone through similar experiences of bringing the partner with them.\n\nIt is not always easy on the partner but it is possible to have a \"happy\" life.

I just have the 1 child, born 7 months into my 1st year, almost 3 now. Juggling is exactly the right word because there is always something either parenting or PhD that needs to be done, so time management is essential. That includes deciding on aspects of your life that will have to be dropped. Hobbies and social life for me are pretty much gone, I know this happens to all parents but it is extreme for a parenting PhD. You will need a strong discipline because you will rarely have any free time. This discipline is really enforced on you, because the PhD is all down to you. At the start I found this tough, at the weekend to relax for another hour or do some work, but you learn if you don't do the work it just doesn't get done. It does get easier, I found my first year really difficult, plenty of times I wanted to quit and just sleep for a week! But now in my fourth year and so happy to be doing what I'm doing, and have developed a routine that works for me. I also highly recommend factoring in time for yourself, it is going to be intense, and there will be really low periods, as well as high, and I know I need an hour here and there just to unwind and not go insane! So yeah, need time to work, but factor in downtime, but get the balance right, but then factor in family time, parenting duties, and the list go on, plenty of balls to keep in the air! \n\nThe other comments here really hit the nail on the head with what you need. I would say a supportive supervisor and partner are absolutely essential. You will have to juggle responsibilities with your partner, and that will bleed into the weekend for you also, you both need to be on the same page and aware that its gonna be a hard few years but worth it at the end. Patience and communication are key! I know I would not be able to do what I do without the support from my amazing wife! The supervisor is also very important, if they have kids that can really help with the empathy! Things are going to come up with your children which will prevent you from working or meeting deadlines, you need a supervisor who will be understanding. Just this week my childcare had to cancel so I had to explain to my supervisor I would not be in the lab much this week and she was completely fine with it, she is a great supervisor and we have developed a good working relationship. There are plenty of horror stories on this subreddit of awful supervisors, so try get a good feel of who you are going to be working under. I was fully honest and told my supervisor in the interview that I was going to be having a kid and there would be responsibilities that could take away from my PhD work. You can tell a lot from their reactions during the interview, if the reaction isn't great in the interview this is only going to get worse when the pressure is really on. \n\nI think your main struggle is going to be maintaining a job on top of PhD and parenting. I worked an evening job for the first year and a half of my PhD, so PhD 8-5 followed by job 6-11. I ended up exhausted, saw very little of my family, just a poor quality of life. We needed it financially at the time but decided to move out of the city and budget a bit better, again the importance of a supportive partner! If you can, I would suggest cutting the consulting down as much as possible. If you can't, then you will find time for it, its amazing what you can fit into a day when you have no choice, but it will take a toll on you. That's just my advice, you may find a way to happily fit the job in also, and you should totally try it but be ready to cut it if need be. One of the biggest battles in a PhD is your own mental health, it can take a battering! If you are constantly run off your feet, under pressure, your mental health will suffer and then everything else will suffer from that. That's not to scare you, just be aware going in to the PhD, and have someone to check in with regularly. I would say to all PhDs VENT, with whoever will listen, other PhDs, your partner, friends, here on reddit. We are all struggling and it is always good to hear that we're not alone in that.\n\nI wouldn't dissuade you from doing it, quite the opposite. If you love your subject and have a passion for what you do, it will be easier. It won't feel so much like work when you are interested in your research. Get your priorities straight in your head, be aware its going to be a hard few years, be willing to work hard and you can absolutely do it!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pwc4iv/phd_life_while_parenting/hegtbnm/"}, "5233": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "mehhrina", "Date": 1632747925, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yeah I have, but they still have interviews ongoing so its impossible for them", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pweyoh/advice_please/hegtpo4/"}, "5234": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1632748080, "Score": 2, "Body": "It has helped me a lot at times, at other times I can feel it decreased my productiveness, so user's discretion is needed to keep it at healthy levels of course\n\nEdit: I now realize the spelling errors as I was writing the comment high", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pw5tvm/cannabis_helping_with_phd/hegu0he/"}, "5235": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Hdis_miss", "Date": 1632748128, "Score": 3, "Body": "These are distinct but related issues.

In any case, you can do your best, with whatever energy you have to mentor/support fellow students, to promote healthy alternatives and coach your (younger, less professionally experienced) peers on tips for managing work stress.\n\n&gt;I have clear career goals and skill objectives for my education. I based my plans from the job requirements for the kinda of jobs I want after I graduate. How are you seeing yourself up?\n\nSounds like you're doing everything right! What's the struggle?\n\n&gt;Money. Money. Money. A PhD has a huge opportunity cost and I'm trying to offset it by living frugally. That said, I'm missing out on investing in retirement when I should be working in my prime employment years. How do you handle that?\n\nYou budget, live frugally, and accept the opportunity cost. The more financially aware younger students hate this too.\n\nThe biggest thing you can do is to keep career planning so you can get a great job when you graduate and make up lost time. Apply for any grants and fellowships that would raise your income. Graduate on time.\n\nOne silver lining is that you're likely in a really low tax bracket (or, if you file jointly, your spouse's income will be in a lower tax bracket). If you're in the US, you can likely boost the value of existing retirement savings by \\~10% by rolling them over into a Roth IRA.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pwk3g3/how_to_be_an_adult_in_graduate_school_a/hehovj6/"}, "5311": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "mostyle", "Date": 1632762066, "Score": 6, "Body": "90K.. \ud83d\ude47\nMay I ask what your PhD is on?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pwjtdg/just_submitted/hehp456/"}, "5312": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Curiouslycurious101", "Date": 1632762365, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yes, and almost every PhD student and many supervisors in my department did too.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pw2z2a/did_you_engage_in_therapy_during_your_phd/hehppd2/"}, "5313": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Aakkt", "Date": 1632762433, "Score": 6, "Body": "Doctoral loans are loans supplied by the UK government and are paid back as a percentage of your wage above a certain figure, and do not have to be fully paid off if you do not make enough money.

I had to point out all the mistakes and also give some critizism to that person's supervisor for obviously not giving a sh\\*t about what the student had sent in to a major journal.

Yes, sometimes they were ignorant old farts (one had never hear about LaTex and the template the journal had provided for 8 years and found it audacious that I had sent in this pdf.... .that looked like it had already been accepted!), but most of the time I did not make myself clear enough.

Unfortunately it takes a lot of time to gather the evidence and then longer still to get it into policy. Then, yes, once a treatment is in policy itself, it can present other, new problems (such as overprescribing, not taking individual circumstances/differences into consideration, etc). For example, side effects of antidepressants are often dependent on the individual, and suicidal ideation is often an initial side effect, but the expected long-term benefits are deemed reasonable enough to prescribe the meds - again, it comes down to the benefit-risk weighting. There is absolutely room for improvement on many fronts for mental health care, but I don\u2019t really see how the treatment itself, such as a specific therapy, can then be regarded as \u2018unscientific\u2019, as a general rule, as a result of shortfalls within the system.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/pw2z2a/did_you_engage_in_therapy_during_your_phd/hel6ihb/"}, "5477": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jodikarlyn", "Date": 1632832773, "Score": 4, "Body": "Yeah, so you should absolutely not be obligated to go.

You don't have to worry about funding.\n\nWhen I first got to grad school, the department paid us to take classes and TA. I'm in physics, by the way. Later, I started working with an advisor and my funding comes through the department of energy, but I have never had to file anything with the department of energy. Part of my advisor's grant agreement is that the grant will support a certain number of graduate students and a certain number of postdoc researchers. It's up to him to choose who those people are.\n\nBecause my advisor does both medical physics and nuclear physics, other grad students who work with him are funded through NIH. Your advisor will take care of anything to do with funding once you're researching. That's way above our paygrades \n\nSo, apply to grad schools you want to go to. I would recommend looking into what research is going on at those schools and emailing advisors who are doing that research. I was interested in dark matter, so I emailed and interviewed with a couple professors who are doing dark matter adjacent research. I'm not doing dark matter now; you are not restricted to whatever you are interested in when you first apply.\n\nI hope some of this helps. If you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nEdit: there are additional sources of funding that you can apply for, such as fellowships, but I have never had to apply for those nor personally had any interest in them. I'm just happy puttering around the lab. My department also guarantees funding for graduate students up through their 7th year.

There is so much homework and I'm spending hours trying to write only a few lines of code, idk why this is so hard for me.

I need to figure out a way to get better at juggling many different side projects/ideas/writing at once. I can also tell my PI is starting to pull off the training wheels more and more during our meetings in order to prepare me for comps. Some of the questions he asks I can answer, but there's still a lot that I just give him a O\\_O face about and mentally add that to my list of shit I need study.
