A PhD is mostly about gaining experience, and that requires time and dedication, as you are demonstrating. The sooner you can get the formalities over with, the earlier you can focus on the next step in your career and life. You're PhD project is already in full swing, but you are obviously free to seek out opportunities associated with more personal freedom after it is over. Showing dedication will furthermore increase your appeal towards future employers and may open doors that would remain closed otherwise. \n\nHowever, a PhD project can also escalate. The stress  that often accompanies the PhD lifestyle makes us more susceptible to psychological predicaments than most other demographics, which is obviously detrimental to the efficiency and creativity we all seek. There is also something to be said for growing as a person rather than just as an academic. Academia is not the healthiest of environments and only moving in that ecosystem will not only challenge your psyche but also your view of world, despite it all probably not being as bad as it may seem. Such effects are to be avoided: happiness remains more important than academic success!\n\nTaking a step back every now and then will allow you to evaluate your progress and to consider your approach to challenges more objectively. Personally, I also choose to allocate some time for fun side projects. These force me to shift focus, allow me to learn new things and may still result in a publication, which may help me later as well. Returning to the main tasks at hand afterwards makes them briefly feel like a \"new\" endeavour rather than more of the same. Finally, be programmed to also actively seek romance, excitement and leisure from time to time.

I still can't read how he is as a person or how your relationship is exactly, but optimistically speaking he should help you move on. On a pessimistic note he might not help you, but it would anyway be better to get it cleared. \n\nWhen you do apply to new professors, I would suggest to be honest and open about what you went through, and why you plan to move to a different lab. But you should also put a positive spin to it highlighting your work and contributions over the last year. Yes, I would mention it in the initial mail itself, and also in the CV. \n\nYou should definitely not feel yourself to be a failure, and you should not erase what you have done. From what I have seen, it is very common to shift labs for a PhD. It is like finding a partner for four years or much more, and taking time in finding the right person is worthwhile. Think about how you would look back at this 10 years down the line -- an year spent in another lab would not change much to your career. I think it is very important to have the right advisor through your PhD, it can change many parameters of how your career gets shaped.\n\nMost often your professors from your previous university would not have a problem in writing the letters again, especially when they know you personally. Again, just being honest about it to them would also help them tune their letters to your advantage.\n\nHope that helps!

Now. During your PhD, you will constantly be exposed to situations in which you are stuck. Asking for help and for input is part of being an academic. \n\nOf course it is normal to be worried; this is new territory and you are tackling things you haven't done before.

Be upfront about what you are stuck with. A good supervisor knows how difficult starting off as a PhD student is, and she will have been through some of those things herself. She won't bite your head off. And if she does, she's not going to be a good supervisor for you.\n\nIf you can't speak to her, speak to someone else at your current institution/department, perhaps a lecturer that you used to get on with.

I'm doing a PhD in engineering in Australia. There's no coursework subjects, but there are a few major milestones along the way that come with certain tasks you need to complete:\n\n* Confirmation of Candidature - done between 6-12 months into your PhD, usually involves submitting a project proposal and some of your literature review, as well as presenting a seminar about your proposal.\n* Mid-Candidature Review - not sure if this is at all universities, but at mine it's done between 1.5-2 years and is basically just some paperwork. Also need to have done 80 hours of professional development.\n* Pre-Completion - done up to 6 months before submitting your thesis. You present a seminar summarizing your work and do some more paperwork.\n\nEvery six months we also do \"progress reports\" that are basically a piece of paper asking us how we're going.\n\nIn terms of publishing, it varies between types of PhD. For engineering, you're expected to publish at least one paper per research chapter of your dissertation - so the chapters where you actually DO stuff. \n\nIn terms of money, there are LOTS of scholarships available for students (even international students). Usually these are paid as a fortnightly stipend to help you focus on your studies, and are enough to cover the essentials like rent, food, etc. With some good budgeting, I still manage to put a fair bit into savings from this.\n\nYou don't have to teach, but I'd 100% recommend it.

Also going to conferences, practicing networking are good for developing those skills you feel less confident in. Even if you have a lunchtime journal club just to do a bit of academically focussed socialising that could be helpful to build your skills and confidence up. Or maybe seek out a mentor/coach who could give you some support to help you feel more confident to try these things, and to help build yourself up.\n\nFor me, I had two years working in healthcare that really developed my work communication skills. Without this I think I would probably feel insecure as a PhD student too. What it took for me was just accepting that I had a skills deficit and then putting my energy and resources into developing that side of myself. We all have strengths and weaknesses, and even though being socially awkward is a pretty stigmatised weakness to have, it isn't any worse than any other. In fact I can think of other weaknesses that are worse than being socially awkward, such as weaknesses that hurt other people (being selfish etc). At least being socially awkward never hurt anyone, except maybe yourself.\n\nIt sounds like from your post that you have a fundamental lack of belief in yourself both academically and socially. My career has really only been able to start thriving when I started believing in myself. By this I mean all those moments when a belief came into my head that I couldn't do something well or that I was just a bit rubbish compared to others I had to consciously shut that belief down using evidence from my life. It sounds like you're doing that a little already because you've given plenty of evidence that you're actually good academically, so the trick is really focussing on the good and not letting the doubts stand in your way. Hope that makes sense!\n\nTL/DR: You might not be as bad as you think socially, but even if you have weakness in this area you can develop it.

I think when you face these troughs in the rollercoaster ride that is a PhD that you make good use of your supervisers (tell then your thoughts / feelings as they may be able to direct you to suitable resources); find like minded individuals (either face to face or online); give yourself permission to feel completely out of your comfort zone, overwhelmed or discouraged as these are all feelings that will occur for everyone at some point in time in most things they do in life; read books on communication (e.g make it stick) or the PhD process as if you are feeling these things chances are someone has written about it somewhere; lastly make sure you have fun outside your studies.

For them, the difficulty just increases year after year until they either leave, get dismissed, or slide through somehow.\n\n2) A student that perhaps wasn't as prepared as some other candidates, but makes considerable effort to gain knowledge and meet expectations - this student might struggle quite a bit until year 2-3, until they 'get over the learning curve' or 'hit their stride'.\n\n3) The student that was well prepared and already has a great work ethic that will tell you he/she only works 40 hours a week on their PhD, and speaks nonchelantly about the difficulty they've experienced in their program. You know, the rare student we are somewhat amazed by/jealous of.\n\nSo if you were a 'type 1' student, it will only get harder year after year and the experience can become mentally crushing. If you are more of a 'type 2' student, there is still a lot to learn/do outside of coursework and comprehensive exams, but hopefully you can achieve a comfortable tempo one-half to two-thirds of the way in.\n\n\n\n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_6e1zme.json"}, "453": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Mouspikpis", "Date": 1496108632, "Score": 1, "Body": "It just gets easier to deal with difficulty IMO.
