I think you're in a strong position, and my general advice would be to focus on your ideas and projects and thoughts without thinking too much whether that matches the behavioral patterns and the expectations of other people. You are living your own unique life, and the outcomes of your actions may drastically differ from those of your peers \u2014 that's totally fine. \n\nYou mixed many different issues into one single bullet. If you consider them one-by-one, chances are you will find an answer to all your questions. Worst case, you'll have something more concrete to reflect on. Here's my attempt to identify these issues: \n\n1. Impostor syndrome. \n2. Comparing your professional profile with your peers' profiles. \n3. The difference between your professional image and your actual skills. \n4. The worry about your post-PhD life. \n\n**Second bullet.** \"a pure scientific value\" \u2014 how is that not a compliment?!\n\nYes, some of the enthusiasm fades away, but you should also feel good about being more efficient at teaching. In my case, though, I had a different experience: I felt that the students feel that I'm infinitely more educated than they are (especially the bachelors), and so I had to encourage them A LOT to ask any questions, submit homework, and, generally, interact in my classes. \n\n**Third bullet.** Sad, but true. Maybe you can find some perks of being a PhD student \u2014 take advantage of what you can do in your current status. \n\n**Fourth bullet.** Again, you refer to issue #3 from my list above. There is nothing wrong from having a professional avatar, a character that your colleagues associate you with, even if it's different from your \"own\" character. You also mention in this bullet that you disagree with your supervisor on what the ideal career for you would be. That's normal: professors are kind of weird in their view of the world, anyway, why should you worry? You know better what career you want, whether you are willing to work 24/7, and in which topic. Learn as much as you can from your professor, but in the end you should find your own path. \n\nHere you also briefly mention the problem of mentorship. This is a huge gap in academia these days, especially in Western countries. If your prof is not your true mentor, you are amongst the 80% of us (my guess). Try to find your mentor elsewhere. \n\n**Fifth bullet.** To my knowledge, all PhD students suffer from focusing problems to some extent. What helped me a lot was to find some tasks that are both important and which I looked forward completing, e.g., due to curiosity about the outcome or the new options they would enable. I think being strict to yourself is not the way to go here, because short attention span may indicate that you have exhausted your mental resources and need to take it easy for some time. \n\n**Sixth bullet.** You should know that those of us who were *not* diagnosed still have many of the symptoms.

I'm actually going to save it for my own wisdom bag... I just wanted to add one thing that really struck me and that I've only recently \"worked through\" (not totally, but I've definitely made progress as I get more experience). \n\n&gt; I also heard that one of them had recently written on facebook that the class schedule I prepared is of \"a poor scientific value\" (whaaat). \n\nSo, I'm not totally sure what your field is but honestly, you can't let arrogant students like this get to you. If I can speak from my own experience (27F and hopefully defending proposal over the summer), I am in criminal justice/criminology and I constantly get undergrads who think they're going to be lawyers (like 50-75% of them say they're going to law school but maybe 5% of them actually do, statistics guesstimated). I worked for a rape crisis center for 6 years - so I have had a couple of know-it-alls when I get to sections in my courses that they *think* I'm less familiar with (i.e. courts or corrections). I actually had one guy try to pick an argument with me over something irrelevant in one of my classes - I just smiled at him and said, \"That's nice, but not really relevant right now. Let's talk later if you want.\" \n\nThe thing is, you worry so much more about that comment and yourself than the students do. The other students see assholes like him (and assholes like the one who made that facebook post) and also think those assholes are arrogant and annoying. That student in my example had quite a reputation among the other Ph.D. student instructors for being cocky in *all* of their classes (we're a smaller degree program in a smaller department). I've also overheard undergraduate students gossipping about him when I arrive early to set up. I mean seriously - think about when you were a student: did you think highly of people who belittled others, especially young professors who are just trying their best? Damn, when I was an undergrad, I remember a grad student instructor who suddenly turned into an emotional trainwreck part of the way through the semester (she told us someone died and then she had a breakup or something) - we just felt bad for her and totally snapped at the student who thought he was hot shit for \"proving her wrong\" on something in class. \n\nI also have found that, sometimes, students that belittle people with more experience than themselves are actually projecting their own insecurities and impostor syndromes. The guy that tried to pick an argument definitely tried to step on my toes a few more times that semester, but every time, I either shut him down or I said things like, \"Well, you're definitely right - that one is news to me, I'll have to do some research on it later,\" or just something like that. I just tried to be honest with him and focused on keeping the class moving and not \"proving myself\" to some punk. Eventually, at the end of the semester, he did come to talk to me - but he *apologized* and told me he was a first-generation college student and always felt like he needed to prove himself and sometimes he couldn't help it. Who knows how true that it, but it was definitely insightful about why some students behave the way they do. \n\n&gt; They also see that you're young and inexperienced and use it. \n\nYeah, they do - so the advice my own mentor gave me was literally, \"Just don't let them.\" For the record: my mentor is a young(er) woman who has almost certainly dealt with the shit you outlined. Some of your experiences are very much gendered (not that men won't experience them, but studies show that women *definitely* have some of this stuff worse; [example](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-017-0872-6)). They will definitely try to push your buttons and see what they can get away with. What helps me is to \"play professor\" - picture someone you really admire and imagine what they would do. How would they present themselves on syllabus day? How would they respond to an email firmly, but kindly? How would they shut down a student talking while you're lecturing? \n\n&gt; After a year of teaching I can say only one thing - they don't care. \n\nIn many ways, you're right. Many students simply *don't* care ... but it's not your job to make them care. It's your job to make them learn a couple of things. If one or two of them cares, that's just an added bonus. We often hold our students to the same standards we hold ourselves - as someone much wiser than me once put it: Your students are the mean... as a future Ph.D. holder, you were two or three standard deviations above the mean and surrounded yourself by people almost exactly like yourself by going to graduate school. You have to orient yourself to being surrounded by the mean and sometimes a standard deviation below and consider yourself lucky if you find a few that are above the mean. \n\nI obviously cannot speak to your experience and what evidence you have to support this claim, but there has got to be at least *one* student in each of your classes who cares - so focus on *that* student. Don't tell yourself you're teaching the \"average\" students (who don't care) - tell yourself you're teaching the *good* students. In every one of my classes, I try to find a good student that tries hard and doesn't act like a jerk and I focus on teaching *that student* to the best of my ability - the rest of them really don't matter.

Sometimes ignorance really is bliss, and if you weren't insightful enough to break down your stresses they sometimes just pass with time.\n\nSo i dont have any solution for it.

I think \"peer-review\" sometimes unjustly serves a label for \"this is true\", especially in popular media. Papers are there to test the waters at the edge of our horizon. The fact that there are people that agree with you, does not make it correct. Moreover, peer-reviewed work may still contain errors. Especially in mathematics and physics, to actually check all results in a paper and independently verify, is a lot of work, which is why it doesn't happen and there may still be mistakes. \n\nIn the end, what is going to make the paper relevant is its acceptance in the wider community. Introducing an arbitrary cut-off at \"peer-review\" may not be so vital. Publishing an un-reviewed paper makes it a lot easier to show your work to the community, and in fact reach out to people and invite them to read an check your work. Sometimes, it can take years for somebody's work to be understood. Famously, in 2012, Shinishi Mochizuki published a paper claiming a proof to the abc-conjecture, a difficult and long-standing problem. To this day, there are only a handful of people who say they actually understand the proof, which is impenetrable because it invents a lot of new mathematics. The validity of the proof is still disputed. Now I don't see this as a failure of non-reviewed papers because they may not be fully accepted.

It requires careful reading, analysis, fact checking, reference checking. In particular cases, it may even require some short simulations (for instance to quickly test an equation) or other more practical work. This work takes time.\n\nPublications do not compensate reviewers for their work, aside from the obvious networking effect you get with the editors, or some newer systems such as publons; the impact of the latter is highly debatable. This means that, while scientists seem to understand that peer reviewing is important, they tend to see it as a minor issue, nor worth a great time investment. This leads to low-quality reviews, which in turn leads to low-quality papers. This is not as prevalent in high-impact publications, where everyone wants to to the best possible, but becomes seriously evident starting as high as second-tier publications.\n\nSimultaneously, scientific work must be supported by financing institutions, universities, companies or, ultimately, the researchers themselves (this is common in PhD work where I'm from). All the while, publishers profit wildly from the work while taking none of the financial toll of its development. In my opinion, this results in a very skewed system where it is unreasonably difficult (expensive) to publish in top-tier publications. While publications do have financial return, as you do need them to get grants, this is not as direct and measurable as the obvious return that publishers get.\n\nI believe in peer reviewing. In fact, I love peer reviewing. Papers I review always get a detailed, thoughtful, thorough review of their work, be it utter shit or the best paper I've ever read.

And even if you don't use their note-taking feature, just being able to cite in the proper format quickly is already a big help.\n2. Have a lab notebook that you regularly use, maybe separate from your literature review notebook. It could help you see which approaches you (or somebody you know) have tried, which ones worked and didn't, etc. When you feel down later in your journey, it could perk you a little bit when you see how you had progressed.\n3.

When writing your research proposal, try to look around for the schedules of conferences you would want to attend to and see how your research schedule would fit. I sometimes see people who become too relaxed except during conference submission deadlines.

Cold emailing the professors running the CV group may help, just don't write complete nonsense and they will give good advice on joining and how likely it is that you'll be accepted; many professors don't have space for new students and many need new students desperately, so it's good to know their status beforehand; most of the time they will direct you to apply through the official university admissions site.\n\nYou should only get into programs where they pay your full tuition and give you a stipend.

So the best thing you can do is start asking people in your department and other departments how they feel about it. \n\nThen you can get into the nightmare of funding. \n\nAlso, I was just in Sheffield for a tournament and no offense to people from Sheffield but it\u2019s a weird place...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bmdwuj/thinking_of_getting_a_phd_overseas/emwftnm/"}, "360": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "purpleoctopuppy", "Date": 1557392042, "Score": 4, "Body": "I use Adobe Illustrator, and found the results quite good (I've won two 'best poster' prizes thanks to it)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bmcxts/conference_posters/emwj3y8/"}, "361": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "tzucon", "Date": 1557394126, "Score": 3, "Body": "Sheffield is weird.

I'm in the 4th year of my PhD and am currently writing my thesis. My 2nd and 3rd years were rough.

And then, someone published something very similar before we were able to submit our manuscript.\n\nSome days I hated every minute of it.\n\nBut I powered through (out of sheer stubbornness I think) and I'm so happy that I made it to the other side. At the time it felt like it'd never get better but it eventually did, and now I'm pretty proud that I got through it.\n\nHere's my advice:\n\n\\- if your supervisor is not helpful and is rude, find another academic that you can talk to and will act as an informal mentor. Do you have a second supervisor? While you are expected to work independently, you NEED support and guidance. It's a learning experience and you shouldn't feel lost.\n\n\\- Remind your supervisor about the manuscript...regularly. A huge part of the PhD is learning how to manage your supervisor. If he doesn't respond to emails, knock on his door. Try to agree on deadlines that will force him to pay attention to you.\n\n\\- Don't worry too much about your work veering from the original topic. This happens all the time. When I started my PhD (microbiology) I was working on a particular organism and switched after my first year to another organism that gave a more promising route. Science is more flexible than people think.\n\n\\- Definitely schedule a meeting about the direction of your project, but prepare as best as you can before you meet. Try to think about what you want to do with the project and where you think the work can lead. If he starts to give you shit, you are completely in your right to tell him that you'd appreciate more support and less harsh criticism.\n\n\\- Be honest with him. Tell him that you would appreciate more guidance and regular meetings, if that's what would help you.\n\nAll that being said, if you truly do not want to continue because you feel like a PhD not right for you, then definitely explore that option!

I don't have time to write a more personalised response, so some of it won't be relevant to you, but I think the main thrust of my point (that you should consider how you will feel in the future more than how you feel now) is relevant to everyone thinking of quitting:\n\n&gt;In my opinion, the decision on whether to quit or not should be based on how you will feel in 5-10 years time, not on how you feel now. If you quit now and get a full time job, will you feel good in five years that you made a quicker start on saving for a house, and you'll be okay with not having a PhD, or will you feel like you made a rash decision and have regrets about it? If you continue, will you feel personal satisfaction with the qualification, and feel good about the opportunities it provides you, or will you regret putting yourself behind the eight ball when it comes to work experience and life savings?\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, if you're truly depressed, this has to factor into it too, because depression can cause permanent damage in more ways than one. So I'm not saying that if you would like to have a PhD you should ignore the pain you're going through now. What I'm saying is that you should weigh all pros and cons in terms of their future impact rather than quit just because you want to stop feeling the way you are feeling right now. Getting a PhD feels interminable while you're doing it, but it's really a small fraction of your life, and when it's over it will seem like a difficult but rewarding blip in your life story. I'm not trying to persuade you that you should stay, because I have no idea whether it's the right decision for you or not, but I think it's important to look at it from a broader perspective than we are inclined to do while we're in the middle of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;And, as others have said, it's pretty common for PhD students to feel like they don't have enough direction, or that they aren't doing well enough. I was lucky enough to have supervisors who were incredibly encouraging and helped me to understand that it's normal. If you're not getting the same kind of support, then if you are going to stay, you need to find another way to get a better understanding of what it's like for others. Posting here is a good start, but you should really find other PhD students who you can talk to about what you're both going through in person. Have you talked to your adviser/s about how you're feeling? If you haven't, they might not realise that you're struggling. They might see a very promising PhD student who they couldn't imagine would be struggling with confidence about it, so they might not have even thought to ask you about how you're personally feeling.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bozofv/i_feel_like_quitting/ennnse0/"}, "640": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "1puffins", "Date": 1557950727, "Score": 2, "Body": "This is complicated for many reasons.

I didn't feel comfortable asking about teaching load and service requirements during AOM interviews. Fortunately, the AACSB has a way to look up accredited schools and see what they emphasize between research, teaching, and service. Full disclosure, these reports are submitted by the schools themselves and some schools may have aspirations that don't match what actually happens in practice. But for the most part, the classifications that they reported to AACSB matched what I heard from the search committees (e.g., when it came time to talk brass tacks during the flyouts) or from others in our field when I asked what they knew about University X. Here's a link to the AACSB reports:\n\n[https://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accredited-schools](https://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accredited-schools) \n\nFind a school you're interested in, click on the \"Member Profile\" link, and look for the \"General and Scholarly Orientation Codes.\" In my experience, these codes provide more detailed information than teaching load alone, and are particularly helpful when you don't know much about the school you're applying to. A best practice might be to use these reports in conjunction with advice from trusted mentors in the field.

I often recommend to take both, if possible, and use the one you get best results.\n\nFinding the best schools is one of the hardest parts, and it's going to take a lot of work. There are many marketing PhD programs in the US, and you need to find those who have professors with research interests that are similar to yours. That means checking the names and then the publications of the faculty of every program. \n\nAlso, it will depend on the strength of your profile, to see what range of schools seems to make sense to you (top 30, or top 100, for example). AMA (American Marketing Association) has a list of universities with Marketing PhD programs, UT Dallas' ranking is one people use the most to have a general idea about the strength of a program. \n\nAbout experience. Research experience is the most important one, having things like a paper published can help a lot. After that, teaching experience can also be relevant. Work experience is often considered not so relevant, but that depends on the way you spin your application (if you are positioning yourself as a very empirical researcher looking for a program with strong ties with the corporate world, that may be useful). \n\nPrevious university matters, of course, but usually not a lot. However, being from strong universities can help to get strong letters of recommendation, which are considered very important.\n\nThe two big areas of research in marketing are Consumer Behavior and Quantitative Marketing, I'm not sure which one you are planning to get into. For CB, applicants usually have a strong background in psychology, sociology, topics like that. For Quantitative Marketing, applicants usually are good at things like Econometrics, and know how to code (R, SAS, Stata, Python, anything like that is ok). \n\nA good place to get some feedback about the strength of your profile after you get your GMAT/GRE scores is [Urch.com](https://Urch.com). That forum has few users, but users that often know a lot. \n\nI have posted a few videos about the process (I still need to make many others, with doing a PhD leaves little time for that). But maybe they can still help somehow. They are in Portuguese, but you should be able to see with English subtitles.

But please remember that a PhD in marketing can be very different from doing a PhD in other fields, even business-related ones. Well, even doing a Marketing PhD in CB is quite different from doing a Marketing PhD in Quantitative Marketing. \n\nI do not check Reddit that often, but feel free to message me during the process.

I'd say that lots of things you wrote are common, regardless of age.\n\nWe miss a lot of our lives while during a PhD. Older people like me may be missing out different things, but we are certainly also missing out. \n\nIdentity crisis and struggling to find your specialization are totally expected. A PhD is expected to do that. You are being trained as a researcher, and part of becoming a researching is finding your place in the science of your field. And that's a really tough thing, even for those who are older. I joined the PhD with a lot of professional experience, and I had a pretty good idea about what my research interests. But, after starting the PhD, and having a better understanding about the science so far, I really had to stop and think hard about the changes that I need to make. \n\nAbout your research interests. If you don't have a strong interest in financial economics, or applied financial econometrics, do not follow that route. You just finished your 1st year, the next years are going to be pretty hard. I also struggled a lot during my 1st year, and when the 2nd year came, it was a lot worse. But at least I was working/studying like 15 hours a day with things that I like, that I have an interest. I don't think I would be able to do that for years and years with a topic I'm not motivated to research. \n\nPeople who are mostly concerned about money usually don't even take the PhD route. Maybe people with other topics of interest make more money, I don't know enough about your field to really know. But that doesn't mean that opportunities for other topics are bad. My professor of applied econometrics does a lot of research about immigration, for example, and she seems to be quite happy with her career.\n\nI think one of the biggest lessons we can learn from a PhD is that we cannot be perfect, but we still have the responsibility of doing the best we can. Dealing with limitations is a major part of research. Of course you would like to have a situation in your work with no endogeneity concerns, no worries about the parallel trend assumption, a lot of granular data at the perfect level of observation for your purposes. But you will not find that. Your research will always be flawed in some way. \n\nSo, many of us have been conditioned to be perfect. But, for a researcher, that's often not good. If you wait for perfection, you will not be able to do your research, and will never finish a paper, for example. You have to discover how close to perfection you can be, understanding that it is not close at all.  \n\nAlso, before the PhD, usually we were all great. I also think I'm good at math compared to the average guy, especially the average guy from Brazil (where I came from). But now I'm not among average people, I'm among the best of the best. People think I'm being humble when I say that I was one of the worst students in class during Econometrics 1 and 2. But, really, I know I can't reach the same level, I just can do the best that I can do, even if it's far from perfect. \n\nDoing a PhD is heavy, most people cannot understand what we are going through. You need to find a way to deal with that. Otherwise, you can burn out, or harm your mental health (even your physical health too). Finding people who are understanding, supportive, and positive even during the worst periods. Finding what kind of hobby you can have, that helps you to keep going (instead of just making you procrastinate with useless stuff). Things like that have helped me to deal with the intensity and PhD mindset you mentioned. \n\nAnd, really, from my experience, the advisor and other PhD students can be extremely helpful. Competent people often do thing by themselves, without relying on others. And often PhD students start with that way of thinking, hoping to deal with everything, without the need for help.

I have a 'Skills' section that I modify quite heavily depending on the job, and I also adjust the level of detail in my work experience so that the relevant experiences have the most detail and the not-so-relevant are skimmed over but included. I also have an 'Objectives' section at the very top where I write a small job or company specific goal behind applying for the job.\n\nFor example, when I apply for a teaching job I pack in all of my experience in tutoring and running practicals, and I tailor my 'Skills' section to reflect what I'm good at as a teacher. My technical engineering skills aren't important in a teaching role, beyond my ability to teach that specific content.\n\nBut when I apply for an engineering or lab job, it's all about the technical skills. If it's software oriented I focus on those skills, if it's more in electronics I focus on those. That's not to say I ignore all of my other skills, I just brush over them in a single dot point while the most relevant skills get entire dot points to themselves.\n\nOne thing I include regardless is my experience in marketing - I've done some student ambassador stuff for my university and it's honestly the ONLY experience that every single interviewer has asked about, because it shows communication and teamwork skills that are often lacking in graduates in my field. So if you have a similar 'special skill' compared to others in your field, definitely include it wherever it might be relevant because it makes you stand out.\n\nSo long story short, keep in whatever undergrad experiences are relevant to whichever job you're applying for. I'd leave them all in a 'base CV' and then cut them out accordingly when you apply for specific jobs.

Basically, I've written 3 papers in the last 12 months and my primary supervisor has ripped them to shreds. I redrafted based on his original feedback, then sent it to him again and the same thing happened - some of his feedback counteracted his original feedback and basically told me to change things back! Anyway, at that point I sat back and had another look at papers in my field and realised that mine actually seemed good compared to what was out there. I sent my papers to my secondary advisor and he showed everyone in his division because he was so happy with them. I told him about my primary ripping them to shreds, and his opinion was that my primary just didn't really 'get' what was the norm in my field because his own field is more technical, less practical.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that, at the end of the day, your supervisor is just one person. It's the feedback of a single person, and it doesn't mean that everyone is going to hate your work or that it's not good enough. It's definitely worth taking the feedback on board and improving your paper where you can, but if you feel that a certain section is good or that the paper compares well to what else is out there, then you might just need to defend it a little bit. Supervisors are experts in *their* fields, but you're the expert in yours so if you're 100% certain that your paper is good, you're probably right.\n\nRegarding supervisors being disappointed, my primary is perpetually disappointed in me. My secondary thinks I'm brilliant. Again, two different opinions in polar opposite directions. It bothered me at first that my primary seems disappointed in everything I do, but I think it's his way of pushing me harder. I try not to let it affect me now, but of course it still does.

A PhD is much more specific than a masters, but that doesn't mean it's going to the specific about something the industry cares.

Chemistry is really too far from what I do, so  maybe I'm not really able to give any good advice. From the little I've heard about fields like yours, I think that are two things you need to think about, to improve your opportunities in the future:\n\n1 - Your research interests. A PhD is usually very, very specific. For example, you would probably study a very specific aspect of battery chemistry, and become extremely good at that. So, you would be valuable for a company that deals with that kind of thing. But probably not that much, and maybe even useless, for other jobs related to chemistry, or even electrochemistry. A PhD can really narrow your opportunities, if you're not careful.  Like, if the only thing you know is how to do something with battery chemistry to reduce climate change, the only companies that have reason to see value in hiring you are the ones that share that same specific interest, and have a position available for that, at the time you graduate. That can be risky. So, developing a profile that can be useful for a broader range of companies and job opportunities would usually be recommended.\n\n2 -  Learn how to get a job in industry. Since a PhD is usually focused on academia, you learn much more about getting a job in academia, and also get more support for that. I've heard people who graduated complaining about that.

You get the PhD because you have adequately learned the tools you need to become an academic researcher in the future. This time is a training wheels session for academics who will spend decades working on a topic that they don't quite understand fully. In that regard, you're in the first 5 years of a researcher's life. Would you criticize a toddler for falling down because they are just learning how to walk? In the same vein, you can't expect a very early career researcher (i.e. PhD student) to do research, write papers, and present at conferences with the aptitude of a seasoned researcher. Comparing a first year PhD student to a 6th year PhD student is also nonsense.\n\nAs for your research, a null result is in fact a result, even if the big name journals don't like that because it doesn't sound sexy and groundbreaking. Your work is still valid, even if it's not popular.\n\nDespite your self criticism, I get the sense that you are not the kind of person to give up easily. Otherwise, why did you stick around all this time? Why would you post this on Reddit looking for feedback when you could easily just quit today? For someone who's not a quitter, this situation is difficult. But here's a thought experiment: if the thought of quitting makes you feel bad and the thought of staying also makes you feel bad, think about how you would feel in 6 months on 2 different paths (quitting vs. not quitting). \n\nSay you get your PhD in 6 months, put this whole chapter behind you, and focus on the next part of your life. Will you be glad and proud that you have the PhD to your name? Is there even a slight possibility that you could leverage the degree to your advantage in your future career? Or will it be a burden to remind you that your research was mediocre and your life was miserable for all those years? \n\nSay you quit your PhD today, put this whole chapter behind you, and focus on the next part of your life. Will you be glad that you saved yourself 6 months of misery? Do you think you'd feel energized and motivated to do something else with your life in these 6 months? Or would you regret the decision to quit? Would you be ashamed to say that you quit when you were so close to being done?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any inkling of not wanting to quit, I would say to tough it out one more day, one more week. Spend that time away from your writing completely. Leave your desk. Don't even stand in your office space. Find a friend or talk to someone who has never heard of the work that you do. Talk to them from the basics and try to teach them what you know. Talk to kids if you want. Conversely, spend a few hours everyday exploring what you think you would be doing instead if you quit tomorrow (skydiving instructor? pilot? freelance photographer?). Watch Youtube videos about that profession and you'll sense in your heart what resonates with you or not. Do informational interviews with people who do what you might want to do in the future. If you don't have people to talk to, you can even talk to a counselor at your university or a therapist. Part of why a PhD is so difficult is that the gratification is so delayed. But a conversation with someone provides something that a blank Word document never could: feedback. Or positive reinforcement. Or a new perspective. Or a spark of interest that you have since lost.\n\nI think the lack of motivation is perfectly normal. It's not motivation that you need to complete this degree. You need to find out for yourself whether this degree is important to your goals, even if it's for a superficial reason. If you have a goal that potentially includes getting a PhD along the way, then there's no question that you need to get this out of the way to reach that goal. You don't need to love what you're doing to have a good reason to do it. There's no need to attribute feelings of passion and fulfillment to a PhD. The time you spend on it will comprise less than 10% of your entire life. You have lots of time to find your passion and to pursue it. Or change your mind a million times along the way. Now is the time to figure out whether a PhD is going to help you discover or accomplish your future goals. There are no wrong answers here. Whatever you decide at this moment is the right decision because you made the best decision you could with the information that you had. The more informed you are about yourself, the more confident you can feel about the decision you'll make.\n\nSorry this got long winded. If you read this all, you're a champ. If you've got nobody to talk to, you can always DM me to tell me about your work.

By contrast, my lead supervisor sometimes suggests things that are either irrelevant or lack accuracy! I know it's the responsibility of the student to find their own way, but still, I need help from them, what's their purpose if they don't offer any help?! I can do this by myself and be my own supervisor if the supervision team does not fulfill its duties towards me as a PhD student, right?

He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/PhD/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/btjkbw/what_is_phd_thesis_nailing/eoz1fsj/"}, "1214": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "tominar", "Date": 1558951069, "Score": 1, "Body": "Out of interest where are you from, because afaik they're pretty much equivalent in the UK (where I'm from)?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/btj779/doctor_of_engineering_vs_phd/eoz1nlc/"}, "1215": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BlueEmpathy", "Date": 1558952465, "Score": 1, "Body": "The delay", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/btjkbw/what_is_phd_thesis_nailing/eoz2i46/"}, "1216": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ManicMarketManiac", "Date": 1558958130, "Score": 2, "Body": "Wtf just happened?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/btftr7/job_or_phd/eozabpb/"}, "1217": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "aggemac", "Date": 1558961315, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yes, we do this at my university in Sweden.

Due to the nature of academia, there isn't much room for error from the perspective of the institutions. Because the system is so binary--either on track to become academic or not, will make a good professor someday or won't, published or unpublished, on time or late, groundbreaking or non-groundbreaking, statistically significant or not statistically significant--it can be easy to consider your PhD a failure. And it doesn't help that professors tend to show little empathy. They easily figured out the methods so why can't you? In reality, many smart, hard-working people with great data and PhD publications will not become an academic, so there is no reason to consider bad data as something that can't be overcome in your life, even if people around you react negatively to your work.\n\nI would advise you to:\n\n1.) Take care of yourself and make sure to do some things you love every day. Find time to escape and shut down the PhD. Every moment spent worrying about the big picture is threatening your health, which is more important than the PhD.  \n\n2.) Before spending another second on your work, think about what you can do to meet the minimum requirements of a PhD. If it's salvageable, remember that 99% of society will be impressed when you finish. \n\n3.) Never neglect non-PhD skills, especially ones you enjoy. My PhD doesn't allow me to do certain things I want to do in my career. Therefore, I spend some time routinely improving myself in these areas. I absolutely hate preparing manuscripts.

In January I bought Maca root and Ashwagandha root powders, which I put in tea once per day. After starting every morning with it for some months, its effects finally set in and the result is that I rarely reach for or need coffee. Crazy bowel movements and anxiety are gone. If I do get anxious, I tend to recognize it immediately and act.

However, it's very hard to say how important that kind of experience would be for applications, without knowing what kind of PhD you are talking about.\n\nI'm assuming it's a PhD related to business in some way. If that's the case, top 15-20 would be considered very, very hard to get into, even for applicants with seemingly perfect profiles. Without prior research experience, and with the goal of teaching instead of research, I'd say you are probably aiming too high (top programs often do not care about teaching at all, with total focus on research). Again, it depends on the specific type of PhD. But, for example, Finance is often considered the hardest one among the business PhD areas, and even top 50 are considered very hard. Even very strong applicants apply widely, like top 50 or top 70.\n\nAlso, I don't know which ranking system you are using, and you said top 15-20 unis in each region. Well, a university ranked 20th in Canada would be very different from a university ranked 20th in the US. At least for business, the number of top PhD programs in the US far surpasses the number of other regions.\n\nOf course, lower ranked universities tend to be more \"merciful\", since the top ranked ones know they can get perfect applicants.  On the other hand, top universities are also often able to take more risks, accepting applicants that do not have a perfect profile, but seem promising anyway. It's very hard to know.\n\nSchool selection is a very, very important part of the process. You need to do your research and find the right programs for you. Especially for your research interest. No matter how good you are, if there is no research fit, chances are slim. But if research fit is great, that would help schools to be more \"merciful\", as you put it.\n\nI don't know how tight your budget is. But for PhD programs like Marketing, for example, I think people apply to about 15 universities on average. 10 would be a very low number. So, even if you are able to make a very good list of the right universities, you still need to have some money to apply with good chances. Still, using the example of Marketing PhD, usually each university accepts only 1 new student for each track (1 for Quantitative Marketing, 1 for Consumer Behavior). So, not many spots available, and you can't even be sure there will be a spot available (they do not necessarily accept new students every year),\n\nAnd of course we don't have information about other stuff that may be important. If you plan to do a PhD that is very heavy on theory, it's very different from another one more focused on empirical research for example. Your work experience may be totally irrelevant in some cases, but help a little in other cases. In quantitative heavy PhDs, they are often more worried about your math (calculus, linear algebra, etc.) and coding (Stata, SPSS, R, etc.) skills than prior research experience. \n\nSo, there is no anwer that is valid for every PhD.

What I will write here is an oversimplification, but I hope it can help as a starting point. \n\nThere are two major areas of marketing research: Consumer Behavior, and Quantitative Marketing. \n\nWhen you write that it is a mix of Quant and Theory, it doesn't really tell us much. Because both areas require both, and oftentimes quite a bit of both. CB is being forced to think about real-world implications, to have a wider set of statistical tools, and things like that. While being Quantitative is not an excuse to not have strong theoretical foundations. Actually, some kinds of quantitative research can be even stronger than the typical CB studies when it comes to theory, as they are based on things like mathematical proofs and game theory, which are quite deep and strong in theory. \n\nMaybe one way to think about it is like this. You want to understand the impact of technology on consumer choices. But what method you would like to use to do that in your research? \n\n1 - You may want to conduct a lab experiment, for example. You select random groups of people, expose them to technology in some way, and see what happens. This approach would be typical for Consumer Behavior. This requires a good knowledge about experiments, something that is hard to get without prior research experience in fields like psychology or sociology. \n\n2 - You may want to make a lot of equations about how the utility function of consumers is affected by technology, under certain assumptions. Just like we can mathematically prove that the OLS regression estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator, under certain conditions, you might be able to mathematically prove that technology affects choice in a certain way. You don't even need data, you don't even need numbers. This would be an approach for Quantitative Marketing studies that people sometimes call analytical modeling. Very strong theory. Prior research knowledge is probably not as important as the first example for CB, but you need to be extremely good at things like functions from Economics, derivatives, matrices, etc. \n\n3 - You may want to use a big data set that is available somewhere to then run a regression (or something like that) coding with some statistical software, and then see what you conclusions you can make from the results. This is one of the weakest regarding theory, because even if you get some results from data, that kind of analysis will not be able to show the theory for that. Maybe you conclude that technology helped in some way, but you can't really tell why it helped. This approach is also for Quantitative Marketing guys, but for a kind of study that we call empirical modeling. In this case, researchers are often more worried about real world uses for the research. Like, for the department of marketing of a big corporation, they are usually more worried about getting results, even if they don't understand exactly why they are getting the results.\n\nSo, the same type of research interest tends to be studied in different ways, depending on the specific research area. All of them have good and bad parts, and complement each other. Although the research areas are not defined by the methods they use, knowing the methods each area tends to use can be helpful.\n\nAgain, remember this is a simplified version. An empirical modeling researcher can also conduct lab experiments, maybe to improve the results he got from data with a stronger theoretical foundation, for example. And these are not the only possibilities, just some common examples.\n\nSo, ideally, your list of schools to apply would be schools that have many professors who work on a research topic similar to yours (i.e., the impact of technology on consumer choice). Assume that you find that Stanford, MIT, and Harvard do that (I don't really know enough, you gotta check it). But, then, you see that Stanford often uses lab experiments, MIT uses mathematical proofs based on utility functions, and Harvard uses real data obtained from companies. Then you should be better able to see which of them is a better fit for your profile. And, of course, see if the other parts of your profile are good enough for top universities like these ones. Like, you really need to be very good at math to impress the guys from MIT, you are someone who can transpose and invert matrices in your sleep.  \n\nWhen people start thinking about to apply, every time I see only the big names like Stanford, MIT, and Harvard, I think they didn't do a proper work regarding school selection. If you do, you probably will find that the best research fit can be found in a variety of universities. Some universities are relatively unknown compared to those, but may actually be a lot stronger than the top universities for your topic of interest. Some of the best researchers don't even like universities like that, because that often is correlated with more pressure, less freedom, independence or support. Like, if you are a top researcher at Harvard, you are just another top one among many. But if you are a top researcher working at a lower university, you are the top dog there. So, don't focus too much on rankings. You probably can really find some hidden gems if you do a good research. \n\nAnd don't be too specific about your research interests, have some flexibility. For example, if you want to do empirical modeling with blockchain, but then you are not able to get data about that during your PhD, then you will need to find something else to do.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bunx04/phd_application_with_no_prior_research_experience/epfp4md/"}, "1348": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AwayConfidence", "Date": 1559200025, "Score": 2, "Body": "Congrats!!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bugqwr/finally_my_first_paper/epfqdv4/"}, "1349": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "thinhvu24", "Date": 1559201687, "Score": 2, "Body": "Congratulations, I\u2019m also writing my first paper now", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bugqwr/finally_my_first_paper/epfu5zy/"}, "1350": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "boldfacebutton7", "Date": 1559204420, "Score": 2, "Body": "Good luck.

There are exceptions if industry sponsor the project as well. Also in the UK it is very independant, there are no classes to attend and you are expected to treat it like a job. I know North America can be different. \n\nAs for applying with no published papers, I didn't, I came with industry experience and an undergraduates degree. \n\nas for which universities in the UK I am not sure, but living cost will vary. I know LSE (London School of Economics) has a good reputation however living in London is expensive. South East England is also expensive as are places like Brighton (nice coastal town). Generally the Midlands, the north are much more affordable. \n\nIf you are considering a UK university let me know and I can answer more questions.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bunx04/phd_application_with_no_prior_research_experience/ephi71i/"}, "1363": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PhD_noob_mutha", "Date": 1559228118, "Score": 2, "Body": "sorry you had to deal with Ms Salty", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/buth2r/just_gave_my_first_conference_talk_and_it_went/ephlbbi/"}, "1364": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SamuraiBrz", "Date": 1559228793, "Score": 7, "Body": "First, congratulations. \n\nI just would like to share something the program coordinator here told me once. We were talking about that kind of issue when people are rude during presentations or reviews. \n\nAnd he said something like this. During our journey to become researchers (as PhD students, for example), we often focus a lot on the problems studies have (our own studies, or someone else's). We need to pay a lot of attention to the problems in our studies, for example, and work very hard on them to get the paper published. Or we try to identify problems in papers from other researchers because they can provide an opportunity for us (we can improve on something that has been done before). Being harsh on ourselves and others is almost like a requirement to get a good job done. \n\nSo, it does make sense to focus on the negative side and push hard. But, if we do that when someone like you is presenting, probably we will come across as rude, aggressive, arrogant, or something like that. Maybe it's not our intention, but that's the way a lot of us have been trained for years and years, that's the way we know how to do things. \n\nOf course that's not the only reason. But I really liked my coordinator's perspective on this. Because, when someone is rude with me, I stop to think that maybe that's the only way that person think they can be of help. They are still trying to help, but they do not know how to do it in a nice way. \n\nOver time, with experience, many of them learn better ways to ask questions and criticize. And over time we will also get more experience to deal with rude questions. But, as a PhD student, it's better to see rude questions as a clumsy attempt to help you. Otherwise, it will be easier to get stressed, flustered, angry, make enemies, etc.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/buth2r/just_gave_my_first_conference_talk_and_it_went/ephn946/"}, "1365": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "zoetje_90s", "Date": 1559231018, "Score": 14, "Body": "Yeah it sucks when people are rude.

But im doing a phd in the uk so i can speak about practical side of things.\n\nIn terms of how soon you should start speaking, i would say start now. Because you are involved in the masters programme this is a great chance to speak to anyone you can. Don't necessarily lead with you wanting to do a phd, instead just be mega curious about any researcher you get a chance to interact with at any level. This is how you can start to understand the academic world.\n\nIf the university you are currently studying with is one you would consider for your phd, then this is about building relationships. Its so hard to explain before doing a phd, but its a weird journey that seriously depends on your relationship with your supervisor. So just attempt to make friends and allies with anyone you can in the school. And try to get a sense of the working culture and the realties of researching there - it is totally ok to decide this school is not for you.\n\nAs this will be more than a year of making connections before you could start your PhD you should be in good standing for the decision at the end of your masters. You'll possibly find that some academics you enjoy working with will end up with an open, funded phd position for you to apply for. This may mean you shape the idea less yourself, but this really makes it an easier start. And as ive said on other posts, i would never recommend someone do a phd without funding!! It's just not worth it. And in the uk most people dont even submit their thesis until the end of the 4th year, then still wait for viva and corrections period. Aim for 4 years funding to alleviate any financial stress!!\n\nIn terms of thesis format, what you describe is \"alternative format\" or publication by papers. As opposed to traditional format. Your university, ad possible your school will have guidance or preferences for this. I can speak for economics generally, but there are trends within certain groups of academics who prepare either alternative or traditional. And there are pros and cons to each. I would say this isnt something to worry about too much before you begin. Even with traditional format you will have several chapters of results which may represent a few papers. Which approach you end up taking shouldnt affect the research anyway. But you are right in saying 3 \"overlapping\" papers in the sense that your research still has to be part of one big story, they cant be totally seperate studies.\n\nIm happy to answer more questions if you have any.

I think there is basically the content and the style question. \n\n**Content:** If you have already data and some sort of data analysis in place: Keep short on theory (I am from a social science field; Probably our norms don't apply to yours) and previous work. You don't have to explain every foregoing study. It is mostly important that you can motivate your study so that people see why it is important that you conducted your study/ experiment, literature review, whatever. On the other hand, it is nice to take more time to present findings, and implications. We have this big conferences in my field, and you can literally see how audience looses focus once someone too deeply elaborates on all the previous research. You see my point? However, how does this look if you don't have any results yet? I was never in such a situation. Probably I would take extra time to explain how I plan to proceed. And I would probably have really clear fields of feedback in mind. Most likely people in the room have more experience than you. So why not tap into that knowledge to potentially improve your study design? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Style:** People always say you need to either rehearse several times and practice a lot. Based on my own experience, I have to disagree. If I rehearse a presentation more than once before, I sound like a machine. It becomes monotonous and difficult to follow for the audience. I was much more successful if I in the process of constructing the presentation already had a clear story line in mind. And this is rather simple for conference presentations. Because the story line is defined by the sections and the flow of your (future) working paper. Therefore, what I do before of presentations, I have a story line in mind. And then, I work myself again through the slides. From the beginning to the end. If I see that something on the slides doesn't suit the story that I want to tell I rather change the wording, etc. on the slide than changing the story line. You see? It is not about forcing your words to follow what is on the slides. It is about creating the most naturally possible fit between the slides' content and the story you want to tell. :) \n\nMoreover, keep in mind that you are going to talk and the slide is only accomapnying you. You don't have to make slides too wordy because you are nonetheless going to elaborate on each point on the slide. If I am somewhat satisfied with my presentation, I do something which comes close to rehearsing. I write to each slide maximum three bullet point (never more) in the note fields. I can see them later on in the presentation viewer. And the most important thing is: I practice the start (only the first slide) of the presentation and I make sure that I know how I want to transit from one slide to the next. I go through my slide deck two or three times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving said all this: My first presentation on a conference as a PhD sucked. My second sucked as well, but a little less. My third was kind of acceptable. And I think beginning with the fourth or the fifth presentation I was at the point that I managed to tell the people what I intended to tell them. So, don't be worried if something isn't perefect. Everyone was at that point. And explaining the complexity that a research project can contain in a simple fashion is almost craft.
