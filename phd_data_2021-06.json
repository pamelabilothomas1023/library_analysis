That's a big leap. Going a step further to submit a paper on your own without talking to him is a much bigger leap. Depending on the details and norms in your field, it could be unethical. And it will almost certainly ruin any possibility of a good relationship between you. PhD students need good relationships with our advisors, since they're the ones that have the ultimate power over our progress. \n\nSome faculty are notoriously bad about returning emails. And they often have their own problems. And many don't understand what good mentoring is (or communication skills, for that matter), especially in computer science-related areas. To be fair, a lot of grad students don't have good advisee communication skills either (though I obviously don't know if you do or not). Most importantly, it sounds like there's a lack of trust between you and your advisor. \n\nIf it was me, I would do three things:\n\n1. Send an email with the title: \"Are you ok?\" In the body, mention that you haven't talked to him in a while and just want to make sure that he's doing fine. This shows you're concerned about him as a human, and it will certainly get his attention if he's checking his email.\n2. Talk to your graduate program coordinator. Mention your concerns. And make sure to ask what the standards for communication, advising relationships, and publication contributions is in the department. This is a place to ask for, and listen to, their recommendation. I've had more than one meeting like this. If they're good, this will be super useful.\n3. Set up a meeting with him, and discuss expectations for your relationship. (If he doesn't respond, have the graduate coordinator help.)  To some people this might sound silly, but it is absolutely necessary. You're going to be together for longer than most romantic relationships. Talk about how and when you expect to communicate, and what types of support you need and he can provide.

Since then I've attached a CV that's edited specifically for academia (so, includes all research activities, publications and presentations, conferences attended, extra curricular leadership roles, teaching experience, relevant work/internship/volunteer experience, etc) to anyone that I've contacted with an inquiry. The responses were all much faster and more interested just from that addition, so I would highly recommend it if you're seriously looking for a position in a lab or program. \n\nThat said, even if you do everything right, some professors won't ever respond to you.

It really depends on your PI. \n\nHear me out. A PI can make or break your entire PhD experience. My PI is great. He is very flexible, really enjoys research so he actually helps me a lot, he's pretty understanding of Life Things that would require my time and energy outside of school. My best friend is getting a PhD at a different school, and she has a slightly different story. Her PI is still understanding, but her workload is much higher and she has very little free time. He doesn't help her much and just kinda tossed her into the research head first. She is constantly stressed and on the verge of a mental breakdown. She's only a year in and has already considered other options if things don't get better once she's finished classes. Then you hear horror stories about people with PIs who expect the student to pretty much always be working, with little regard to their health or personal lives. Pregnancy discrimination is also a thing that hopefully you won't have to worry about, but should be aware of. \n\nMy recommendation is to wait and see. Don't go jumping into anything until you've started and gotten to know your PI, how the two of you work together, what your work load is like, and how much stress you can expect already without a baby. Your stress level might change semester by semester, so it's not a perfect method, but it will at least be a decent baseline to then start discussing how you WOULD manage if you did have a child. Who will take care of the baby when you have a deadline coming up? Can you afford daycare, and other major expenses that come with having a baby, on mainly your partner's salary? Because unless you've got a REALLY good stipend it probably won't help you much. What is your insurance like? On top of that, who will do other routine chores like cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc? Do you live close enough to extended family who might be able to assist? What resources does your university provide for students who are mothers? \n\nTLDR wait until you have a better idea of what life will be like once you've started, and what resources you'll have available. If you get a semester or two in and feel like you could handle the added stress of a pregnancy and then a new family member, then go for it!

My friends in math here have said that it's your advisor's job to help get you a job (or sometimes just \"get\", without the \"help\"). So it's probably a good idea to talk to your supervisor. Explicitly start by telling her your professional goals, and ask her what she thinks. She might be able to make connections. Though I would be very careful to phrase it just as asking for advice, and not what you \"should\" do. Since, if she says no, you risk damaging your relationship if you do it anyways. You could also get advice from other respected field in your department, and then make sure to mention that some of them said it was a good idea. This will make it harder for her to forbid you. Cultural expectations matter here, so that's the most this American can say.\n\nRegardless, you should be making professional connections - both at your uni and away from it. Conferences and workshops are good for this. You can also volunteer for a leadership position in something like a professional society.

But I got a research grant to be a visiting student abroad for 5 weeks in China (I'm Australian doing a Ph.D. at McGill). The city is not a tourist destination, so there was zero English, and I speak zero Chinese. I had excited fear leading up to it, and the first week was a tad rough because I couldn't have an entire conversation with anyone. 2nd time was when I applied for a stupidly large student research grant which involved me talking to companies to get additional funding.\r  \nAll in all, it was over 100k in cash + in-kind services across 13 different universities/companies (in my STEM field, student grants usually are 2-5k). And by some miracle, I actually got it. COVID sent my plan into a tailspin, but I still have the grant. After the epic high of getting the grant, the fear kicked in with all the beautiful things I said I'd do. \n\n\r  \nMy honest advice is to lean into it. You'll be surprised how quickly some of those fears dissolve when you embrace the uncertainty. After the first week of being awkward around the other students because we couldn't talk, I realized that no one cared. They were happy to show me around, go out to eat or whatever it was. Actually went on a date while there, and the entire evening was spent using google translate. \r  \nFor the research grant, I freaked because there is a vast difference between saying you'll do something and actually doing it.

I do believe \"normal\" PhD students should be recognized for their work, however, I am not sure I agree with what you define as normal.  I think any and all PhD (or masters) students are normal as long as they put time and effort into their studies, what happens in their free time shouldn't change that. My department is a mix of domestic and international students, we have people that are married and people that are parents, people who are interested in politics and sports and everything in between and I would define them all as normal PhD students.  What we don't have in my department is people who devote all their free time to their degree.  Some may spend more time than others but everyone I interact with has interests and hobbies outside science that they regularly participate in.\n\nIts unreasonable to assume that people dedicate all/or even most of their free time to more work.  For many people, my self included, free time is just that, time where you are free to do what you want.  If you look through this sub and other subs dedicated to people pursuing graduate degrees you'll see lots of discussions about how important having work life balance and making time to do what you enjoy is.  I know personally when I leave my office/lab for the day I am usually done with work for the day.  \n\nI also don't think you can say that other people don't appreciate the opportunities they receive while pursuing a PhD just because they have other things they dedicate their time to that has nothing to do with their degree.

I don't personally recording TikTok videos, but my understanding is not all of them are excessively time consuming (though many are) and it is unlikely you know the specifics of how many hours these students put into their videos versus their degree research, so you are not really in a place to judge their use of time either.\n\nAs well a lot of PhD work is about dissemination, both inside and outside the academic community. TikTok reaches many more people than a journal publication ever will. TikToks are also more than just dancing videos (Not that those aren't also a very valid type of content) and often used by academics and professionals for getting their research and work to the masses. Just as many use YouTube, podcasts, Twitch, Instagram, etc.\n\nPresuming that academics shouldn't pursue means of connection and communication is pretty harmful, especially with the burden of work and strain that academia brings.\n\nThere are many times when one might finish an exam early, by the way. Taking a long time to do something isn't inherently a good thing if you get mired down in work that could be streamlined or is simply superfluous to your own research. Maybe these students are simply more effective and efficient with their practices or their research is sporadically intensive which allows them periods of time with more flexibility but also has times where they don't have that much free time.\n\nThis really just sounds like more justification for dismissing and invalidating their work as either done wrong or poorly because their waking hours aren't wholly consumed by their degree.\n\nThe reality is that shouldn't be the case. Yes, PhD students do find that happening more often than not, but it is a falsehood to say that is how it should be. No student's life should be all consumed by their research, regardless of academic level. No student should have to be putting in over the top hours into RAships and TAships because it is the only way to afford their degree.\n\nSaying that kind of life is \"normal\" and a reflection of \"hardwork\" is just wrong. It is the narrative of the predatory nature of academia which normalizes the use and burnout of graduate students to run its research and teaching commitments while continuing to underfund those same students.\n\nSo rather than trying to invalidate students for having a healthy work/life balance, maybe your time is better served to challenge the expectation that PhD students should lead such an unhealthy life and be accepting of it without question, you know, since we're all about saying how students time is best served and all.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ns2q67/why_is_it_that_it_seems_that_public_recognition/h0k3uls/"}, "399": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Conundrum5", "Date": 1622808930, "Score": 3, "Body": "Self-promotion is a skill.

The teaching ones are typically an extra burden on top of the research you must do but research assistantships can come from many sources including a T32 program, or your PI may have to grant money to pay for that.  \n\nBut the research you do is really at the core of the training. You take a couple of classes at the start but in most programs, you are only doing research and maybe attending seminars after that. The research work that you do will become the matter your dissertation will be on, this is typically set at the start of your program, but can change sometimes drastically depending on challenges you encounter.\n\nThe work is the training. Many programs explicitly disallow you from having separate employment. This is sometimes an issue when the stipend doesn't pay enough to get by.

Maybe at the least, just read the papers that I already have read and have a good idea on it just to refresh and give myself a positive reinforcement that 'okay, at least I understand that' haha\n\nSo I hope my situation or habit explains a bit of your thinking. Of course, your work pressure is way too much, but I see myself someday as a PhD candidate to be an independent researcher.

A week off. Something so that you don't think about your work. \n\n- Have an outline of what you want to write. Then just write. Don't worry about the quality, don't hit the delete key. Just write. Say what you want to say but don't fix it. Follow the outline you create.\n\n- Once you've written it all, then edit what you need.\n\nThink about it outside of the emotionality of it all. You have enough energy to type four paragraphs for a post on Reddit that likely took you perhaps 5 minutes to write. You didn't think about the writing or what you needed, you just blurted it out, then probably edited the parts out.\n\nThat's the same way of writing a dissertation. Don't think about the pages. You already know what you want to write at this point, and probably just need some skeletal guide. But what's weighing you down may likely be an expectation of perfect that makes no sense. Just write. Fix later.\n\nEDIT: To be more specific about the writing portion.\n\n- Write what you would normally just say. In other words, just think of the words that you would have in a conversation about the topic you're discussing, even if it's a methods portion or whatnot. As someone that curses a fuckton, my first drafts always had swears in them (I shit you not), especially when remember something frustrating. \n\n- Don't worry about citations. You remember hearing something somewhere? Put in [FIND CITATION] in there, highlight it, and come back to that after you've gotten the chapter or draft done.\n\n- Take the emotions out of what you're writing. You passion is in the work, NOT in the reporting of what you've done. \n\nThis might be a bit on the later side, but I loved writing Discussion sections in my papers, because they were literally *discussions I had with my colleagues and supervisors about the subject at hand*.

I had a project I was developing and was able to get off the ground very quickly. At the time, I was going through the patent process and trying to find ways of pushing my technology forward (was actually the same project I was discussing with the grad student describe above).\n\nWe're both in the bar, and we start talking shop. It's clear he's asking a lot more questions, not to quiz me but more to figure out how to strategize his position. I had actually been undergoing *more* of the experience that he was just coming into problems with. We discuss the options that he might explore, how he was going about things, how I was going through similar challenges and was able to mitigate concerns or move things forward.\n\nOn the drive back to his lab, he starts asking me what I was going to do next. He knew that when I left for my postdoc that I wanted to try the academic route.\n\nTold him I didn't think I wanted the academic lab position anymore. The hardest part wasn't the project but the politics of the academic realm that I was just unwilling to deal with. But at the same time it opened other opportunities and perspectives. He agreed actually, that what he went through as a grad student and postdoc in his time was very different than what it is now.\n\nAt some point I wasn't the student anymore. Towards the end of grad school, if you become very competent and people really rely on you and your experience (some people don't honestly, but I don't think you'll have this problem), you \"graduate\" into that mentorship position naturally, and oftentimes take that mantle up as a postdoc as well. As more time passes, you end up diverging your path more and hopefully do grow even more, have a unique perspective.\n\nYes, the anxieties will yield. I think it helps to keep an open mind and seeing your growth and progress, and noting the mistakes. And even moreso that you just make the growth happen over time, whether that be in academia or other places.

If you've a mind to go into industry or to do industry focused research in an academic career then in my opinion it's an excellent place to be. \n\nI find it to be a funny kind of research as a computer scientist, you're not necessarily on the bleeding edge devising the latest algorithms on curated datasets, it's sort of like being the bridge between the bleeding edge and the \"real world\" (this is a really reductive phrase which will annoy some people, but I can't think of a better way to put it). \n\nI also find that since many of my colleagues are nuclear engineers or physicists that sometimes things I took for granted in CS just aren't on their radar, so in that sense I do think the research is enriched by having a person with a tech background in the room instead of all domain. A quick example from just this week, we were discussing how to format the output of an analysis system we're building and my supervisor sort of took it for granted that it'd be a relational database. I suggested we use a graph structure instead and pitched some of the manipulations and spanning strategies that graphs would let us use, and now that's what we're going with. Sometimes this takes a lot more convincing, as some people are set in their ways and have favourite solutions, but I think this is the case in many other fields and has so far for me been a net positive.\n\nSome very applications focused researchers in my team have got themselves stuck in a bit of a self professed rut of submitting to a small family of nuclear specific journals which don't get much attention outside of the field, and if you let yourself fall into that rut then it would make it much harder to have an academic career (where citation counts and impact factors are a big deal). I find that's something I've been able to manage so far by trying to keep my nuclear stuff as less of the focus of my work and always framing it as a \"case study\" or \"example data\", and proposing the journals and conferences I've personally found useful instead of just the Nuclear ones. My supervisor has been fairly supportive of that, if slightly cautious about moving out of his own comfort zone, but your mileage may vary.\n\nIf you want more specific responses feel free to PM me, I'm more than happy to offer my own opinions or ask my teammates anything you'd like to know.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nug60r/renewable_energy_phd/h11gj18/"}, "813": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MissCNkiss", "Date": 1623169160, "Score": 8, "Body": "I haven\u2019t experienced quite the same things as you, but I\u2019ve definitely considered quitting very frequently for other reasons.

Even if you no longer want to be in academia a PhD degree can afford you many opportunities in your career and usually correlates to higher pay.\n\nAre conferences and publications required for your graduation? Sometimes they are not, and mostly just look good on a CV (for academic positions). Since you want to leave academia I don\u2019t think you need to put so much emphasis on these. Now if you do need publications to graduate, you need to ask your supervisor exactly how many/what papers they want you to publish. Now as for actually writing a paper, some supervisors provide no guidance sadly, in this case, you should look online for various guides and also when in doubt, you can always replicate the formatting of published papers in your field. Essentially you need to teach yourself. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve established exactly what your supervisor wants from you in order to graduate, focus on those and then get out of there! As for the students you are mentoring, they really shouldn\u2019t be depending on you so much, that defeats the purpose of learning how to be an independent researcher.

In my field (marketing), I believe that doing a PhD in Australia would make things much harder to enter academia in the US. \n\nSome reasons for that:\n\n1 - The best ranked Australian university is # 62 in research productivity. There are 45 US universities above that rank. There may be several reasons for that (like funding), but it's hard to ignore that the elite in research is dominated by US universities. \n\n2 - Although one could complain about being \"unnecessarily long\" or having \"unnecessary classes,\" I would say all of that that still makes us stronger in the end. For example, more time means that we have more opportunity to start over if our project fail. If you only have 3 years, and after 1 year of work you find that your research is a dead end, I suppose you will be in deep trouble. More time in general also means we have more time to explore different projects, topics, methods, etc. Even unnecessary classes allowed me to exchange ideas with lots of professors, get closer to them, earn their trust, open the doors for some opportunities, etc. Certainly my bonds with the faculty is much stronger now in my 4th year than it was a couple of years ago. More time also meant that I could do other things that are not \"necessary\" but that are of value for the academic job market, like several semesters of teaching experience or participating in the organization of academic events. I guess it would be much harder to do that with only 3 years. \n\n3 -  Networking with people in the US should be harder if you are in Australia. After all, you will be on the other side of the world. It's probably not so easy to meet with professors from US universities, as we often did (before covid). \n\n4 - Doing a PhD in Australia would show you how things work in Australia, not how things work in the US. Whether you like the \"annoying/primitive\" ways of the US, that's how things work here. If a university hires someone from a more \"streamlined PhD program,\" it is hiring someone from a different system and now that person will need to adjust to the US \"annoying/primitive\" system.\n\nSo, I think a PhD from Australia will have even more obstacles to overcome in order to get an academic job in the US.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nvn31x/how_much_does_it_matter_which_country_i_do_my_phd/h14bry6/"}, "870": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Weihua99", "Date": 1623216536, "Score": 1, "Body": "Gotcha, this makes sense.

So you\u2019re taking a very brave step and forging your own path. \n\nKudos to you!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nvtrei/feeling_all_kinds_of_emotions_about_quitting_my/h15qaw5/"}, "936": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Agent_Goldfish", "Date": 1623250698, "Score": 2, "Body": "&gt; \u200bIdeally, I'd like to enter academia in the US much later down the line after residency/fellowship -- with this in mind does it matter which country I choose to do my PhD in?\n\nI'm going to massively disagree with the other redditor and say it doesn't really matter that much.\n\nI'm doing my PhD in a different country (NL) than my masters (DE) which is different to the country I'm from and did my bachelors in (USA). I can honestly say that switching between countries for my degrees has been a learning experience each time I've done it, but it's not impossible nor has it made a barrier.\n\nAs for that other redditor's reasons:\n\n1. \"Rankings\" are a very American concept. And they are often based on the things Americans think are important. German universities tend to suck at rankings, but that's because Germany university have a huge focus on equitable access to education, and that's a measurement not often included in rankings. And \"research productivity\" seems like a pretty nebulous concept. Overall, I would put much more importance on the people you'd be working with than any ranking. Seriously, your supervisor is the single most important factor in whether or not you complete your PhD. If you have multiple options, go with the supervisor you vibe the best with.\n\n2. This is the only thing I kinda agree with them on. The US education system is VERY forgiving. In DE, universities kick you out if you fail a class too many times (also classes are mostly evaluated with a single final exam). This is utterly terrifying. At the same time, the US education system can also be unduly influenced by politics and money in a way universities in other countries are more insulated from. There's pros and cons to different systems, it's up to you to weigh them. If you think the 3 year deadline is a pro for you, GREAT! I was able to handle the test anxiety in DE, but someone who struggles with tests would not find that system workable.\n\n3. Come on - a lot of networking now occurs online. Plus, a major chance to network is at conferences, which you'll still attend if you're living in Australia. And depending on your university, they might sponsor trips to other labs. My university pays for me to travel to other universities when we're working on joint projects. Being in a different time zone has not been a real barrier. This sounds like they're grasping at straws imo.\n\n4. More grasping at straws. Again, I'm now at a third university in a third country. Every time I move, I have to get adjusted to a new system. This adjustment takes a few months, but otherwise is not a significant barrier. And universities know this, which is why the Australian university likely isn't making a big deal that you're an American, and an American university won't make a big deal about you having an Australian PhD. \n\nAs for reasons you should do a degree abroad (or not care about where the degree is offered):\n\n1. You prove your ability to adapt to new systems. Part of the reason I was hired to do my PhD is that I've lived in 5 countries as an adult. I have a proven history of adaptability. So they were comfortable hiring me even though I hadn't been to NL in over 10 years. \n\n2. You learn about different methods of doing things. This goes back to the problem I have with \"rankings\". US organizations judging institutions based on how they do things the US way. US institutions often don't do Masters/Bachelors theses, whereas these are standard at EU universities. And these theses are really important, both for the functioning of the university and also for the education of students. This is a reason my university doesn't like hiring people with only a US background, because they don't know how to handle Bachelors/Masters theses.\n\n\n3. You might want to work outside the US. Getting a foreign degree will not present a major challenge to working in US academia. But only have US degrees might actually present a major challenge to working in foreign academia. I know my university is often hesitant to hire people who've never really lived outside their home country, because they don't want them to freak out and go home (this happens a lot and it's expensive).\n\n4. Once in a lifetime experience. Seriously, if you've never lived abroad, take the chance to do it now. It's worth it, even if there were a minor career hit (there won't be, but even if there were, I still think the life experience would be worth it).\n\nIf you're getting good vibes from the Australian university, I'd say go for it.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nvn31x/how_much_does_it_matter_which_country_i_do_my_phd/h15rndt/"}, "937": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Kateth7", "Date": 1623251647, "Score": 3, "Body": "Check this out: [https://aarontay.medium.com/3-new-tools-to-try-for-literature-mapping-connected-papers-inciteful-and-litmaps-a399f27622a](https://aarontay.medium.com/3-new-tools-to-try-for-literature-mapping-connected-papers-inciteful-and-litmaps-a399f27622a)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nvv5f5/is_there_a_way_to_search_for_articles_by_multiple/h15txbi/"}, "938": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Gatechap", "Date": 1623252274, "Score": 2, "Body": "Sure thing!

I was given the option to either go on with the defence as planned (albeit changing my approach to try to address all the issues), which had a risk of failing the defence and having to do it again at some point in the future or to delay it and get a different external examiner while rewriting the thesis to address the issues.\n\nI chose to go on as planned, and spent the next two weeks basically redoing my entire defence approach from scratch. The defence ended up going very well (I was world afterwards that it was \u201csuperb\u201d), but it went the full three hours after needing to explain everything to the external, and then the deliberations lasted another hour beyond that. (As far as I can tell, everyone but the external was in favour of minor revisions, while he wanted major revisions to essentially add in a bunch of extraneous material - the issues that I thought were more important were minor to him). After nailing down what changes needed to be made (at one point, it seemed like he wanted much more extensive revisions than were agreed to, so I politely rebutted this in an email that was CC\u2019ed to the rest of the committee), I spent the next few weeks making the revisions, submitted by mid-January, and got my degree in late February. As far as I can tell, a lot of the issues here were due to the external being an\u2026 older\u2026 professor whose knowledge of the relevant literature was outdated in some respects (I still don\u2019t know why my supervisor chose him).\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s up to you how you choose to move forward here, but my own advice would be to keep going - the fact that the external is the only one raising these objections when your committee is in favour tells me that these issues aren\u2019t nearly as bad as they\u2019re claiming.

The average cost to rent a 1BR apt in this area I would say is $1200-$1400. If it weren\u2019t for my husband and his salary, I would definitely not be able to afford an apartment on my own. With that being said though, a lot of my coworkers rent a room in a house for $600-$800/mo and they seem to get by just fine. \n2) I personally live 40 mins from campus, with a terrible commute, but most other people I know live within a 5-10 mile radius from the campus. I think it depends on where you can find availability and what you can afford. \n3) The number of hours I am in lab varies. Some days I don\u2019t have experiments, and instead need to write manuscripts, study for classes or attend journal clubs/seminars. It usually depends on what you have going on. \n4) I feel this really depends on your supervisor. I set a strict limit of 40 hours a week. I am able to go to the gym in the mornings before work and spend time with my husband and family in the evenings and on the weekends. I also refuse to check my emails in the evenings or on the weekends. With that being said - based on what I\u2019ve seen I am definitely the exception. People in my department are forced to work 8am-6pm minimum including 1 if not both days on the weekend. Even if they have nothing to do, they are required to be on site. I even know some people who are not even given holidays off. So this really depends on your supervisor (be sure to find a good one!) \n5) The qualifying exam is hard. It\u2019s meant to be. Can\u2019t speak on to the defense yet, but I would assume it\u2019s slightly less difficult because you are mostly just defending your work rather than being bombarded with questions regarding your broad area of study. Both are nerve wracking for sure though.\n6) I applied to 5 schools, because I had a specific program in mind and also wanted to stay local. I\u2019m sure others will say they applied to many more. \n7) I personally never reached out to any PIs prior to being accepted but if you do this, it can help you decide which you want to work with and might be able to help you get admitted (for example, you\u2019ve impressed a specific PI with your qualifications and they are looking for s new student. If they see your name in the application pile they can say they\u2019d be willing to fund you). Once you\u2019ve been accepted to a program you\u2019ll definitely want to look into PIs who you can do rotations with. You might need to talk to them beforehand to see if they can even afford a new student, and to see if their research is really something you\u2019d be interested in. Once you\u2019re rotating in a lab, definitely try to see if you like the PI and can see having a good working relationship with them. \n8) Although everyone knows a PhD is hard work, you can never truly be prepared for everything you\u2019ll experience. The most difficult things for me have been a toxic environment in both my lab and my department. Students have been abused both emotionally and physically by their PIs. So my number 1 piece of advice would be to make sure you find a good supervisor - ask current students, former students, people outside of the lab but familiar with the PI etc. - what type of person they truly are. Even with the best of PIs the process can be tough, so be sure to maintain a good work-life balance, do things to take care of yourself, and be sure to make friends and have a good support system both at work and outside of work. \n\nI hoped this helped, and I hope it doesn\u2019t scare you away from pursuing a PhD. Even though it\u2019s tough, it\u2019ll be worth it in the end!

Pink and 'Hyperfocus' by Chris Bailey - because I'm nothing if not acutely aware I should be doing more PhD work. Ha! All the following echos a lot of what other posters have written already too. I think it's about finding what works for you and running with it.\n\nFrom Create Space: I try to keep a journal/to do list that I fill in at the start of the day (so I can articulate what I want to do rather than feeling guilty that I should be doing more work 24/7) and then reflect on what I've done at the end of the day to see if I'm being realistic in setting goals.

This helps me avoid looking at a pile of journals and thinking \"that's too much to do\" by breaking it up into manageable chunks.\n\nFrom Indistractable: when reading those papers, I block out all potential distractions e.g. Turn off all notifications from emails/apps and use an app called Forest (essentially a pomodoro method app) to lock me out of my phone for those 2 hours. I also used a pomodoro timer on my watch to break this up into 25 minute blocks with 5 minute breaks in between.\n\nFrom Drive: also remind myself what my end goal is for doing this research e.g. I want to be awarded a PhD after defending my thesis.

Some old roommates of mine were in grad school in different humanities majors. Their application and admissions processes were completely different. They (and their peers) were paying full tuition price and were not employed by the university. So if you\u2019re not in STEM, maybe I\u2019m not the one to listen to. \n\nSo I think my best leg to stand on was that I was an undergrad research assistant and presented a poster at a conference. So I had a little taste of research experience. I know some universities differ, but I would say that standard in the states to get a funded graduate position is to email the faculty person you want to work for. The university I did my masters at (R2) wouldn\u2019t even allow you to apply to the graduate school until a faculty person had told the admissions office they would be hiring you as an assistant. So I picked someone out. I emailed him saying I was looking for a graduate research assistant position for a masters degree. I told him a little bit about myself. And I attached a copy of my current transcript at the time, along with a CV and a cover letter. We emailed back and forth a little bit and he told me he would hire me. At this university, tuition was waved for all graduate research assistants. So it wasn\u2019t an issue. I was EXTREMELY lucky because I know people who had better track records than me at the time who spoke to dozens of professors before one would hire them. So don\u2019t be discouraged if you\u2019re being ignored or told no. \n\nMy process for my PhD was a little different (R1 if you care). The professor I was an assistant for as an undergrad called me and asked if I would like to do a PhD with him. I said yes. My situation here is different than most people. My advisor is at the university I attend, my assistantship is from a different university who has research facilities in the city I\u2019m in. The university I work for pays my tuition bill at the university I attend. I just sign a waiver every semester giving them access to the bill. My friends who are on assistantship at the university I attend have reduced tuition. My boyfriend pays around $700 a semester for grad school, which is considerably lower than the full tuition price. \nI didn\u2019t really have to fight for this position, it was quite literally just handed to me. I\u2019m extremely fortunate for that. \n\nYou can get into grad school with a less than ideal GPA if you can make a case for yourself on why you\u2019re worth it. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what country you are in, so I don\u2019t know how it works wherever you are at. I also want to offer some advice to you, and I don\u2019t want this to discourage you. I want this to be something you keep in mind if you do decide to come to the states for graduate school. Do your very best to pick an advisor who is a kind person. I know way too many international students here in the states who are flat out abused by their advisors. They\u2019ll have them working insane hours, I\u2019m talking 80 hour weeks indefinitely. Because the student relies on that employment to keep a visa to stay in the country, so they will do what they are told no matter how awful.. so they can stay here. Pick someone that cares about you as a person. Graduate school is hard, you\u2019re going to work a lot, you\u2019re going to be tired a lot, that is normal. Being forced to be in a lab for 80 hours a week, every week, for several years\u2026 for 20 hours worth of pay is not okay. So pick someone who is nice. \n\n\nI realize a lot of this is sort of sporadic and written poorly. I study crop science and we have been working like crazy trying to finish planting.

I\u2019ve been quite stressed with the whole situation so I tend to over share even with people that I do know hahah. I think this will be a long reply - I\u2019m sorry! \n\nI started my PhD last spring (April 2020). When I started I was given 2 projects - none were funded, biiiig red flag - but I didn\u2019t see it.. \n\ninitially the plan was to run some experiments in the summer, so we can collect data and apply for funding in the fall (for one of the projects), but as you can imagine with the pandemic that didn\u2019t happen. So for my first 2 semesters - whatever I read was based on the project that I was told I\u2019d do. December 2020 came, he received a very big funding for another project. He placed me on that - so now I had to switch directions and get familiarized with this new topic , which is also btw new to him too. I did my PhD with this specific Pi because of his contribution to the field I knew , not this new stuff - but okay whatever. He then told me that the RA was doing all the purchasing, equipment buying, whatever forms we needed to submit - the RA was there, so I could focus on reading , and that\u2019s pretty much what I did... however, I did anticipate that because this is a new area to him, that we just don\u2019t have the infrastructure for this type of studies so I often asked about the equipment and even the space where we would place the equipment but was always told that there are options in the university so if everything else is ready and set to go, that equipment won\u2019t hold us back. Well it\u2019s been now 2 months since we have had everything set and ready to go and now we\u2019re missing the equipment. A few weeks ago though he said that the equipment has been ordered and that we have to wait something like another 2 months to receive it (it\u2019s coming from overseas) but then last week he said that actually the equipment wasn\u2019t ordered. I\u2019m not sure whether he lied, but it sounded like he did because later on he also said that the order was never placed because the company didn\u2019t have a catalogue number in their system. Another red flag? I don\u2019t know anymore tbh. \n\nMy other project is still not funded , we have everything ready and set to go (already a month ago). Because it is not funded we cannot do all experiments but will do a couple (2-3, maybe 4) and then put the project on hold. We didn\u2019t have the equipment for this project either but he managed to involve other people in that project so we could use their equipment. And now that everything has been set and ready to go - guess what? One of the research associates we need to run this study goes on holidays next week so it\u2019s another 2 weeks of waiting. In the meantime, they juuuust (last week) started a new project - this project is supposed to be run by an international student who is stranded in his country for the time being but will hopefully come in early 2022. None of this is communicated with me until it happens basically, I\u2019m kind of told we miss \u2018xyz\u2019 to start, then we get xyz and something else pops up. Anyway, now this project is their priority - I guess because that has funding and not mine? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy lab mate started with a funded project. I don\u2019t know whether all their projects are funded (they themselves don\u2019t know as I\u2019ve asked). And before starting their first project, my PI involved them in other projects so that they can gain the skills they need to run their own project (it\u2019s a thing they do in my uni - they only train you when projects are running , you can\u2019t get trained if there is no project). So this student has already completed 4 projects I think, and now that the other project is starting , this student is also involved in that project too - so that they can learn the skills they need for their later projects. But that new project is also essentially very very similar to the one I will be running , but I\u2019ve been completely left out of the discussions or the experimental days . So far, I\u2019ve waited what? Since April 2020 that\u2019s I guess almost 4 semesters , and I have no idea when I can start with my experiments. \n\nI kind of threw a tantrum on my supervisor last week because I was really upset that this new project had started, has priority over mine (which I\u2019ve waited for so long) and worst of all that it is so similar to mine and that I haven\u2019t even been considered to be involved in those experiments. There is one technique that is used in that project that both myself and my lab mate need to learn - but since my lab mate is involved in the project they will learn it like that. My Pi told me to get the equipment and use it with the master student and learn how to use it like that . So naturally I kind of went crazy and told him that I\u2019m upset that I haven\u2019t been considered for that new project because I also need to learn these methods. He said that I can\u2019t be involved in everything and he only involved the other student because they were now only busy with data analysis as they\u2019ve finished a few studies already. On Friday I mentioned to him that the reason I was unhappy is because the project seems similar to what I\u2019ll do (methods wise) and that it would have been nice to be given a head start - since we have that opportunity. He said that he later thought about it (after my tantrum ) and that he realized that I should have also been there but yeah it is what it is. Honestly I feel like a shitty student to be going after my Pi and telling him all of this. But at the same time I am 4 semesters into a program and I completely rely on him for how fast things are moving .. and it hurts my feelings to no end that he only thinks about my lab mates training and I\u2019m never a priority. \n\nObviously this is stressing me out quite a bit. He did involve me in a side project when my lab mate was running their own PhD related stuff , only because my lab mate didn\u2019t have time for this as well (this project was also meant for them). So that\u2019s something that is keeping me busy, and he did give me some old data to analyze so there\u2019s that too. So I\u2019m grateful for that but it\u2019s also weird because with the side project for example - I don\u2019t have access to the facilities I need and I often wait in front of doors for people to open them for me (because I\u2019ve mentioned this to him but he snapped back saying he has no time to be requesting keys). The old data - is great but it needs to be done on a specific software , which I don\u2019t have access to because my lab mate does and I\u2019m only allowed to use it on weekends, evenings and holidays... I know he tries but the execution of his plans is a bit , yeah.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether it is normal that this situation is stressing me or whether I feel weird about the way my PI manages his lab but yeah. I\u2019ve been playing the waity kitty game for quite a while. And because I\u2019m blind to what exactly is needed more or is missing I guess I\u2019ll play that game a little longer.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nu7hor/_/h1j1auk/"}, "1339": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nihal6063", "Date": 1623515598, "Score": 1, "Body": "I don't know if Canadian universities accept GRE score ?

When I was in a PhD I had a similar thought process too. I agree with the comment by EggPan313 that you can set your own path and my comment here is not to go against that but I wanted to set out what helped me and more recently I think in part this PhD student. If you are not happy with your work this is normally in your power to change, but that can be daunting.\n\nNow most of us come into science research thinking it is an exciting cutting edge affair. We are normally realistic and are not expecting accolades and prizes or even recognition. But we do think we will normally be excited by what we do and that a paper is a substantial piece of work. I want to tackle both these thoughts.\n\nA paper is a substantial piece of work\n\nNow, this is true, but not in the way we initially think. A paper should be something new and of interest for the most part. But what we do not realise is that even a small addition to an approach or model is an important step. Maybe not by itself, but as part of the larger picture. It is always nice to step back and think of what is the big story, and where does my work fit. All parts of the big story are important and worthy of our time and effort. Without each part there is no progress, there are few topics in science these days that can take a giant leap in one paper.\n\nWe will be always excited by what we do.\n\nI think being excited about the piece of the big picture you are contributing to is hard. For me, I am excited about things I do not understand. I want to learn more and figure out what is going on at the start of a project and all is great. Then I get to the end of a project, I understand it, and now I am meant to write a paper and sell it when I find it boring and mundane because I understand it. We often forget that those steps to understanding, though they may seem so now, are not trivial. They need to be explained, and for this, we need to publish. So I often do this, I take a step back, work on something else or just take time off for a few days. I then come back to the work in question and I do not think about the work itself really but what is the story. I can be excited about trying to tell someone a story, so I focus my mind on thinking that is all I am doing. I personally like to rephrase my work into the stages of the [Heroes Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey). Suddenly I find it exciting again, not the work I did to get there, but telling this story.\n\nThis approach and thinking worked for me. Maybe it will work for you.

If your advisor is at all aware of administrative, once you mention that you're registered, they'll know that discrimination laws are suddenly in play. So they're more likely to take your health problems seriously. It sounds like you've got a good advisor, and that shouldn't be a problem. In many cases, though, it's good to keep everything in writing in case there are some discrimination issues.\n\nAlso recognize that your funding is coming out of someone's budget. They're paying you, and they're justified in expecting a certain amount of labor out of you.

Part of my postdoc was used to successfully transition into a different job type, for a frame of reference.\n\nSo this is a REALLY hard PhD to navigate for several reasons, not limited to the breadth of the PhD, but the amount of bad advice that come alongside with it. Neuroscience itself is *important*, but its utility is limited because of the complexities involved with the field, and I would also argue the poor translatability of so much of the work going on. \n\nSome pitfalls first:\n\n- Your PIs likely have no idea what the fuck they're talking about in terms of job prospects unless they are coming from a different field *into* neuroscience (e.g. if they come from, say, a cancer background and your signaling experience can get you into, say, a neurooncology program of some sort).\n\n- There was a common advice for a long time that any PhD will grant you a position outside of academia if you massage your resume. My issue with this advice is that those \"low hanging fruit\" jobs have been taken at this point. In 2015, having some remote basic programming experience with a neuroscience PhD would have landed you something. In 2021, that's just not the case; those same businesses need more specialized solutions.\n\n- Your projects tend to be theoretical, and your actual abilities are limited as they're sort of \"half-assed\" versions of expertise that other fields can fully delve into. In other words, you don't make a product.\n\nSo in my case, I recognized this in the middle of my postdoc and was seeing my career get into this dangerous position where I wasn't in a big enough lab to push me into academia, and didn't have enough skills to really get into industry or anything else.\n\nI had two choices.\n\nThe first was to use my postdoc to fund subsequent extraneous training. Do the bare minimum but take courses to get some sort of job. I've had other colleagues that did this, but honestly it looked miserable.\n\nThe second was to find and develop a project that would allow me to be competitive in the marketplace. This required tying in my postdoc work as an independent project and to develop it into a product that can be used to move my career forward.\n\nThe latter is a lot harder, but... you know, it was a lot more fun and fulfilling. I did this early enough to make the pivot, but also landed on a project that allowed for a very fast turn-around.\n\nIn my case, it was making a device that ended up getting attention in clinical fields, expanded to engineering, opened other academic doors but, ultimately, also gave me options to either start a business of my own *or* to move into other job options like tech transfer or regulatory (for instance). \n\nThe physical products included a paper, a patent, and grant money. It broadened my stock to other industries that otherwise would not have looked at me, and gave me open options.\n\nAdmittedly that's not something available or viable to everyone. But one thing I would encourage people to think about is to see how their work can promote a product. How can you findings be use to physically be sold or used to others? That expands the base of your abilities, makes you literally marketable beyond just your degree.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nzshkk/have_my_phd_trying_to_get_out_of_science_dont/h1sdd8b/"}, "1567": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "EggPan313", "Date": 1623712920, "Score": 2, "Body": "You're not limited by your degree. And I would argue, the earlier you identify the niches that you can fill, the easier the transition becomes.\n\nOne thing that neuroscience, as a field, appears to ignore or forget is that in order for development to happen outside of the ivory towers of academia, infrastructure needs to be put in place to bridge those findings into realities. The next generation of PhDs will be important in trailblazing those paths, but may have to take risks and do so on their own without the guidance of old PIs that have no clue on how that is to happen.\n\nSometimes, yes, it will be hard. But I think people in PhDs should *embrace* that, and be willing to take those risks. In doing so, it actually opens their options to do bigger and greater things.\n\nIt's important to identify *what* you want first and to be able to plan forward. If you're in your 2nd or 3rd year, this is the best time to explore.

There are tons of exciting jobs in national labs, R&amp;D, data science, the tech industry, finance, etc. etc. that routinely recruit smart Ph.Ds. Further, the feedback loops and multidisciplinary cooperation between university, government and industry should be promoted and nourished. It is natural for an advisor or researcher to feel a bit sad that a brilliant student or colleague is \"leaving\" academia, but it is stingy and a bit short-sighted to let this feeling prevent you from also being proud and happy for them and from keeping productive links with these former students and colleagues.\n\n(2) You should only pursue an academic career if it makes sense for you. Further, \\*many\\* of us (myself included) have applied to industry jobs during that path, and I know many brilliant colleagues who have made successful careers in industry (and are absolutely happy they switched), and some that have gone back and forth between the two (it is, admittedly, tougher to switch like that).\n\n\\*\\*\\*NOTE based on comments: I am not saying this to imply other paths are \"easier\" or \"the backup option\". I am just saying it is perfectly fine to start wanting to be an academic and then switch, and that many have felt and gone through what you might be feeling and thinking right now. This is the path I took and the reflections and feelings I had going through it, take them with a grain of salt. \\*\\*\\*\n\nDon't fixate on the few people, junior or senior, who are unable to look past themselves or what they want for you.

To do so, it's always a good thing to talk to people who are doing or have recently done one in your field to know what is the actual deal, the workload, the real timeline, the ressources available, etc. A lot of people seem to realize the workload once they committed and it leads to a lot of dropping out so to avoid loosing your time get good intel.

You will need to do the thesis, but that's the basic thing everyone will have, so what makes YOU special? You need to publish, to be in a network, on committees, on projects, in side-projects, etc. The thesis is not easy at all but people often forget it's just your entry ticket to applying to certain jobs, the REST will make you stand out.

For the first, it's really only useful if the career you want to advance to requires a PhD, or if the research skills would give you an advantage. For the second, getting a PhD isn't the only option (people can join labs and publish without a PhD), but a PhD will open a lot more doors for you. There is a third group of people who would do it just to be able to say they've done it, but again unless it's actually going to help them career-wise it would be a waste of time and energy. \n\nFor me, I decided to pursue a PhD because I felt it would be the best way to make a real difference in my field. I work in animal science, and the work that I'm interested in primarily involves improving the lives of animals, however jobs in animal welfare are few and the opportunities to actually help a lot of animals are fewer. There is a lot of resistance to change as well, which ends up meaning if you work in industry, you could be stuck in a cycle of continuing with outdated practices that don't actually help anyone. So for me, it seemed like the absolute best way to make a real difference was to contribute to the actual science of the field and then distribute the knowledge we can gain from our research. On top of that, I enjoyed research as an undergrad and while getting my master's, so I felt pretty comfortable with the decision to go forward and continue into a PhD program. So far, things have been going pretty well, so I'm still feeling good about it. \n\nI also just like the idea of being a professor and getting to do my own research and building my own lab, but also sharing that with other people. My current supervisor is probably the coolest person I know, he loves what he does and he loves getting involved in the research and helping his students become the best possible scientists they can be, and I feel like I have a similar attitude and that the work would be quite fulfilling.

The umbrella programs, however, looked amazing and are perfect for people a bit more interested in the foundational/basic science part of biology. \n\nI say this because most schools have umbrella projects in the bioscience departments, whereas the BME/BioE/chemE departments typically have a more direct admit-type system. What this leads to is professors who are in both a BioE department and an umbrella program may have only a few spots for the umbrella program and many more reserved for BioE folks.  This may make it difficult to get into those labs even if you did a rotation in them! Labs which are primarily in the bioscience departments will likely have more opportunities for umbrella students. \n\nA general tip as well is to ask professors if they\u2019re taking students your year/what you need to do during your rotation to get a spot. The worst case would be doing a rotation in a lab you love but the professor refusing to give you a spot because of some other constraints. In general that is one drawback of rotation programs, that rotation != lab position. That said, these instances are somewhat rare and if you\u2019re indecisive rotations are a fantastic opportunity. Plus, it\u2019s probably more likely to get stuck somewhere you don\u2019t like in a direct admin program rather than a rotation program. \n\nI think I got lucky and am in love with my program and Professor, but I do know others in my program who are stuck in a bad environment.

I\u2019m here because it\u2019s the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for this kid from a working class family. \n\nMy perspective may be quite different than some. I\u2019m currently in a PhD program in the social sciences and I was 54 years old when I arrived, a little older now. I have a child and a grandchild. I have had 2 careers, one of which provided a modest pension. I am likely quite a bit older than you. I am a first-generation college student. I came from a working class family and could not afford college. Then, I was working full time and parenting. Time slipped away, but I always had my dream of becoming a professor. \n\nOver the years, as I kept restarting my undergrad program, it seemed like it would never work out. Then, one day I realized I had overstayed at my last career and I needed out! I looked around and realized that none of the earlier barriers were present anymore, and now I had an array of interests (causes) that I could pursue. I finished my Bachelors in 18 months (60 credit hours in a year - required the Provost\u2019s approval), entered a masters program in my current field via a half-semester of law school (that noise is the sound of me flushing money down the drain!) and landed here a few years ago. Each of those things required about a year of preparation, testing, application, and waiting. \n\nThe reasons I chose the field I did were several and they all centered around a desire to contribute to meaningful social change.  I wanted to help people, and I envisioned using my big mouth and white privilege to help people without those privileges tell their stories and help change the unfair and unjust social structures and systems here in the U.S. I had become interested in the abysmal treatment of seriously mental ill folks like my brother (May He Rest In Peace), including putting them in a concrete cell with nothing but a toilet - and often without clothes, supposedly to prevent self-harm - and leaving them there untreated and hallucinating.\n\nThen I became aware of the problems of money bail, pretrial incarceration, and plea bargains, how they work together to pressure often innocent poor people who can\u2019t afford to pay bail and desperately want to get out of jail to plead guilty. This often includes the seriously mentally ill, like my brother. And that\u2019s how I ended up in a social science PhD program, pursuing qualitative research that will hopefully including some community participatory research, helping people tell their stories to advance various social justice causes.\n\nTake it from me, life is too precious to spend much of it doing something you don\u2019t like, doesn\u2019t bring you joy, or feels like servitude just for money. Pursue the things that matter to you, that you are passionate about, and you will find ways to be comfortable financially. But if you prioritize the money, don\u2019t be surprised with the disillusionment down the road.\n\nYou can change your mind at anytime. If you have the opportunity at this point to apply to and attend a PhD program, go for it. Make sure it\u2019s what you want to do and not merely what you are good at or what family has envisioned for you.\n\nYou will need to apply a year in advance and may need a GRE, GMAT, or some other exam and applications are typically due ~9 months before candidates would begin classes. Begin the process now for a Fall 2022 start date. Look for programs that provide \u201cfull funding\u201d for their PhD students. This typically includes a graduate assistantship (TA/RA) that covers your tuition, employee health insurance, and stipend (current National average ~$18k a year). It is ridiculous to consider a program that does not offer full funding. You will be too busy to work another full time job. There are a lot of granular details to choosing which schools to apply, but a full ride is baseline in my book. I suppose if you or your family are wealthy, that\u2019s less important. But, then, you\u2019ve probably always attended great schools.\n\nFollow your passion. Don\u2019t have a passion yet? You might find one while working during a gap year. You can always go back, though there is no question that the traditional route (all your schooling continuous) is the easiest approach. \n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/o0e5x2/how_did_you_decide_to_do_a_phd/h1wxqdd/"}, "1709": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "OnMyThirdLife", "Date": 1623805202, "Score": 4, "Body": "I think I\u2019m still on a couple waitlists from years ago\ud83d\ude02 Hang in there!

I conduct my studies around my job so I\u2019m not sure how well my experience represents the norm. \n\nBut I\u2019m under the impression your experience is pretty normal. I\u2019ve got 2 academic supervisors and one industrial who is my boss. I\u2019ve had supervisors forget my name, extended periods of no comms (we\u2019re talking 18 months of radio silence), supervisors sleeping through meetings, zero enthusiasm or tangible input from supervisors etc and some of those continue to this day. \n\nIve had a few realisations that might apply to you also. In the early days (first year full time) it is reasonable to expect more help from supervisors but if it isn\u2019t forthcoming it\u2019s not going to appear and you need to find your help elsewhere. For me this was from colleagues and industrial partners. For you this may be other students or post docs etc. It\u2019s also worth noting that for a supervisor the start of a project isn\u2019t that interesting as the student is usually getting up to speed with the problem and can\u2019t contribute much at that stage. \n\nFor some supervisor interest increases the closer you get to results as this is closer to publication. \n\nOn a different note, I can count on one hand (with two fingers) the number of times I\u2019ve been told \u201cgood job\u201d in 8 years. It\u2019s a great shame but your victories are your own and shouldn\u2019t be diminished because they aren\u2019t appreciated by others. I think in my case this is because my supervisors are either unfamiliar with my work or are emotionally bankrupt. \nOne thing I will say is that the more you are left to your own devices the more capable and independent you will be by the end (which will be of benefit in whatever you pursue after your studies). Turns out repeatedly banging your head against a brick wall does make you more capable!\n\nFinally, regarding overworking, to some extent this is a choice. But there will always be periods that require more time than the norm. For the most part I\u2019ve been able to maintain a work life balance, but at times that\u2019s completely out the window.

In terms of freedom of schedule however, it depends on the company, but hopefully you can get into a good company that lets you have the freedom you want. And here's the thing, PhD isn't a regular \"degree\". You don't \"need\" it to earn. You do it if you want, when you have the mental, physical, and emotional space for it, if you are sure you are interested in the field, and if you get the right support. If any of the conditions aren't satisfied, you'll feel miserable. There's no deadline for PhD. If you quit today, nobody is going to stop you from joining a PhD next year, or 5 years from now, or 20 years from now. And who knows, by then the field will mature and you might find more interesting things to work on. BUT, if you genuinely feel like you like your research is interesting and you want to give it a chance too develop, and you are willing and able to live with the dissatisfaction for a bit to see if the situation changes, then i think you should stick with it for at least another 6-12 months. Again, you decide how long of a time period you want to give to see a change, bit give it at least 6 months. YOU decide you limits. Don't be afraid to quit. But also don't be too rash. If your guide is supportive, you can speak to them about your concerns. If they're not (that is a big red flag in my opinion and you shouldn't be there at all, but that's a different conversation) then find other colleagues and talk to them about your fears. There is life after PhD. There is life without PhD. You never need to feel like academics is the only place you'll find if you have a PhD. \n\nTL;DR Quit if it's affecting your physical and/mental health. If you are willing and able to give your project time to evolve, then give it at least 6 months before making a decision. Talk to supervisor/peers.\n\nAll the best! &lt;3", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/o2049g/thinking_about_leaving/h23u4rj/"}, "1945": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "imwatchingthematrix", "Date": 1623948498, "Score": 1, "Body": "I don't know with bringing her over or anything, but $2000 may be enough to live on for 2 given your area just may be a stretch if your in more than a smaller/not as nice but decent appartment.

In some fields you can see people publishing several papers, but in other fields it would be very rare to see even a single publication. \n\nI will focus on the one question that probably is more generalizable: the fundamental difference between a masters and a PhD. I can think of a few differences that should be valid for most PhD students. \n\nDuring a master's, you are usually a student, learning in a more traditional way (e.g., taking classes, reading books, etc.). During a PhD, you are more like an employee. Although you can take classes and read books, for example, you learn mostly by working as a researcher. \n\nDuring a master's, you have a better idea about what to do. What books to read, what classes to take, what skills to develop, what schedule to follow, what is the timeline. And, if you don't know what to do, probably someone can tell you. During a PhD, you often have little to no idea about what to do. And you are researching something new, maybe nobody knows what you should do (if they knew, probably there would be no need to research). So, the problem is not only that you need to do everything on your own, have more self-initiative, or work a lot. The main problem is typically you do all that with a lot of uncertainties, failures, and dead ends. \n\nDuring a master's, you can have an advisor, but it's more like a professor guiding the student. During a PhD, your advisor is your boss. Someone who can define or influence almost everything you will do during a PhD (and sometimes after that). The PhD advisor holds a lot of power over the experience of the PhD student. How your experience is going to be? How many papers you have to publish? How many conferences you will go. Do you need to write the grant proposal yourself? What side projects you will do? All of that is usually up to your advisor.

(1) contacting someone higher up, (2) contacting other professors/programs. I think you should consider doing both because your advisor is crossing several lines here. It's one thing for an advisor to ask you to leave their lab but asking someone to leave an entire program is batshit crazy (atleast to me, in the U.S./engineering-field).\n\nFor (1), you can reach out to department head or a dean of graduate affairs (whoever you trust more).

Not living up to one person's expectations, does not define you. Sometimes it's difficult to switch if you are already years in, but you may be able to find people who want you when you broaden your search. Although it's less common, people do even transfer PhD programs. That is a similar process where you kinda have to email around and talk with people to see if your research interests/skills align with theirs.

Here are my thought on your list.\n\n(1-2) 32 is still pretty young to have a PhD. There are people in my department that ended up with their PhDs in their late 30s and beyond. The idea of having stuff figured out at a young age is BS and everyone's timeline is their own. 1/3 of your life in school is a lot but if you love learning then it's a good place to be.\n\n(3) I can't comment on this personally (recently out as Bi but in a straight passing relationship), a few friends who are LGBTQ say that grad school can be a challenging place. I'm in a fairly liberal state in the US, and there are usually clubs on campus dedicated to supporting LGBTQ students so depending on where you are it may be possible to build your LGBTQ community in addition to keeping up with your current community virtually. However if the school you are going to is not supportive of LGBTQ people and/or doesn't have an large/ present community  this can be really exhausting (as I'm sure you know) which can make the PhD journey even more exhausting/ stressful than it already is. \n\n(4-5) I have no words for this, it's a tough situation. I wish you all the best with balancing family and career.\n\n(6) Grad school destroyed my mental health. Everyone I know has had some mental/ physical health stuff during grad school, anxiety, depression, sleeping disorders, substance abuse, etc. If you already have a propensity to it, it seems more likely that it will come up. That's not saying that you should or shouldn't finish your PhD. I was stubborn and didn't get help until I really let myself deteriorate, now I have a low dose of generic prozac  and I'm much better. My advice is to do some therapy/ whatever other things help your mental health and make those things as high of a priority as your PhD. It will help in the long run. \n\n(7) The hysteria (pun absolutely intended) about women's fertility dropping as she gets older is pretty scientifically unsound. There's a great clip on Adam Ruin's Everything about this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YIz9jZPzvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YIz9jZPzvo) \n\nThat being said some people prefer to have kids younger and that is fine too, it's a personal decision.\n\n(8) I ask myself this every day and I'm about a month away from graduating. No one can answer this but you. I'm sure you do have what it takes, but the real question I've been asking myself is \"is a PhD worth what I am putting myself through?\". Also imposter syndrome is very pervasive in graduate school, some therapy and outside perspectives might help.\n\nHope this helps!

I have just quit after working on it for 3 years part-time.\n\nMy field of study is (was) Deep Learning, my experiments were initially very successful and were presented at international conferences. My supervisors and I started looking to publish but repeatability and robustness of the results stood in the way for nearly 2 years. \n\nIn this time I also worked closely with senior colleagues to produce science outputs that did not depend on deep learning or even machine learning. Unfortunately these were not published either, which further contributed to what I began to recognise as burnout/experimental exhaustion. \n\nI think the thing to recognise is that you can see your weaknesses and are amplifying them because of what you are seeing as immediate failures, it is important to remember that despite the bubble of being surrounded by other students you are pursuing something that not many people are capable of even beginning to do!\n\nYou are in the first few months of the process, I would recommend speaking to your advisor about training opportunities you can work on to shore up weaknesses you have identified (imagined or real, burnout can cause you to focus on the wrong things) and remember that the non deep learning project may also be an opportunity to learn the paper writing and experimental process in a \u201creal\u201d environment. This will pay dividends in the future if you are not confident with your writing.\n\nI think it is also likely that your professor is recognising you are panicking, by offering you this alternative project they may be trying to give you space to breath and think on something else.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to be honest, the earlier you can have frank discussions with your professor the better.

Project supervisors don\u2019t want to wait around and delay the project outputs (completion, papers, further grants) because the student needs to go and work or save up for a bit.\n- Self-funding raises questions around the significance, impact, and/or rigour of the project.

When a PhD is self-funded, it's a major red flag and basically means no one in your research field cares enough about the specific contribution that would be made. Otherwise, they would provide the necessary funds that can secure a student working on the project. Why would that matter?   Well, why would you want to give away 3+ years of your life (+money) for something that might very well not further your career? \n\n It's not really an issue of ''should I go into debt or not for higher education'' as it often is for undergrad or Master's studies. At the level of PhD (self-funded or not), you need to consider if the research project is ultimately going to benefit your career or if you will waste 3 years of your life that could have been spent working in your field building your career and starting your ''real'' life (post-education). \n\nThis is hard to evaluate when the PhD is funded because you can see there is a real interest in the research (otherwise wouldn't be funded), so then it's just a matter of evaluating how big the interest is and how it could affect your career path. \n\n However, when the PhD is self-funded, it's clear that it didn't generate enough interest to get funding so the issue then becomes more personal. People usually start considering a self-funded PhD when they really think the PhD title could help them get the job of their dreams (often in research &amp; development), but they keep being rejected when applying to funded PhDs... which raises the question ''why couldn't the student get funding'' which will have a negative impact on any scholarship/grant applications that you might make to fund your PhD.\n\nA PhD is like a job and a university benefits from the student work through the visibility that comes with the student's publications and the generated research visibility when the student attends conferences which can attract industrial partners for other projects, academic collaborators, give them more funding, etc. Would you directly pay someone to work for them? I 100% think self-funded PhDs are a way for Universities to make money like they do with international students. There are self-funded PhD projects that have been up on my UK University website for like 4 years. They literally just sit there until someone has had enough of getting rejected to funded PhDs and applies.  \n\nSorry if this was harsh. Please do not go for a self-funded PhD.

It is incredibly frustrating and debilitating, especially when writing is such a central component of academia. When I have previously encountered writer's block, it's made me question my abilities and my worth as a researcher. I hope this isn't the case for you, but if it is this is something I have started to use to remind myself to be kind to myself (it's a little clumsy but I hope you get the idea). I like to run, and while I am no marathon runner I consider myself a good runner. However, if I twisted my ankle I wouldn't condemn myself and say I am useless as a runner. I'd acknowledge that I cannot run in this moment, and that is all.\n\nIn this moment, you have a twisted ankle, and that is why you can't run. You need to take care of your ankle, and then you'll be back at it!\n\nWhen it comes to taking care of that ankle (i.e., overcoming writer's block), here are a few of strategies I use generally that I find especially helpful for overcoming writer's block.\n\nFirst and foremost is setting myself attainable writing goals. Before I begin writing, I set myself a word count that I want to hit by the end of the session. And I make sure these goals reflect the context in which I am writing. End of a long day? Then maybe all I will aim for a minimum of 50 words. Do I have the afternoon off? Then lets try for 300. The key is making it achievable IN THE MOMENT.\n\nThe second strategy I use is writing by hand. Each session I do the majority of writing by hand first, following which I type it all up. Some people find this bizarre, but I find it is a lot easier to maintain a flow because I cannot easily edit (i.e., deleting, restructuring, etc.), and nor can I be easily distracted (even by something as \"productive\" as finding/inserting a reference).\n\nThe third strategy I use is talking. Word, and I believe Google Docs, have inbuilt dictation functions. If I am too tired to write, or if I am feeling overwhelmed by writing, I will use Word's dictation function and just verbal diarrhea whatever it is I am thinking about (in terms of my research). This is one of my favourite methods to help me get out of my slump, because it is the easiest way to fill up a page FAST.\n\nThe final strategy is walking, preferably in nature (and even better if you can bring along a four-legged friend!). I find walking is the best way to help me recharge and refresh. Through the simple act of removing myself from a stressful environment (i.e., my computer desk), I am already better able to think. I often combine walking and talking by using my phone to make voice memo's or dictate notes to Siri.\n\nBuilding off the last strategy, if you have found yourself sitting at the table for weeks on end, unable to write, then think about re-contextualizing the act of writing. Make your desk face another way, light some nicely scented candles, or buy yourself some flowers to put on your desk. Make yourself coffee/tea and get yourself a tasty treat to enjoy while you are writing. Or try writing in a different room, or in a different building altogether. Through modifying your environment and creating something that is inviting, you are going to create positive associations with writing and recast your relationship with writing.\n\nBest of luck, I know you can do this!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/o513bq/completely_blocked/h2kidch/"}, "2534": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Lithiriana", "Date": 1624303395, "Score": 3, "Body": "I can relate.

If you have a strength in some other aspect of research presentation, like making conceptual diagrams or defending propositions, find a way to use that as an end-around to getting words on the page. \n\n2) This one I got from my therapist - I calm my nervous system down at the start of writing. When I\u2019m stuck, sitting in front of my open laptop usually comes with a feeling of panic that overwhelms higher thinking and makes me want to do absolutely anything other than write. Rather than let that feeling dominate, I look at my draft and let the feeling bubble up, and then I sit for a minute and notice that I\u2019m actually safe where I am.

It might not be healthy and they might make more mistakes if they maintain their focus for more than 6hours, but the typical workday is 8h in most focus-demanding fields if not more in STEM so i don't think it's that big of a deal.

PhDs are time-consuming and money consuming. Many people give up because of the related mental health issues and the overall difficulty of it.

However, what exactly are they asking you to do? If they're trying to get you to do a co-editor, think long and hard about accepting because acting as an editor for a non-monograph volume or special journal issue is a shit-ton of work. Speaking from the experience of recently guest editing a thematic journal issue, not only do you are you going to be expected to contribute a chapter (or two), you'll need to write the intro, gather and keep on top of participants *from start to finish*, interact with the press/journal rep/editor, and do a chunk of copy-editing. These sorts of projects only go as fast as the slowest person and it's my understanding that edited volumes tend to take a minimum of two years to materialize because of book/press considerations beyond your control, and are more likely \\~3+ years. Themed journal issues tend to be a bit smaller and can be faster if everything comes together. \n\nIf they're just trying to get you to write a chapter or whatever, though, well, that's a bit easier to manage. The question then becomes what are you going to write about and does it overlap with your diss idea? Do you have some pre-existing research or a fun term paper that isn't going to be a part of the diss? Or early stage diss research that you could explore a part of in anticipation of developing it further and then eventually re-use down the line in the diss? \n\nFinally, in some fields edited volumes aren't super well-regarded. I mean, would you be better off just writing up your own chapter and sending it in to a peer-reviewed journal? I dunno... but if the answer to these sorts of things indicates to you that there is some value to taking part in the edited volume, go for it! You need to get some practice and familiarity with the academic publication game after all...\n\nTL;DR - Edited volumes/thematic issues can be problematic b/c they can sometimes take a long time, be valued less, and be a shitload of work.

How long is it expected to take? Are there time limitations for submission requirements?\n\nThis issue is that the US (among others) does PhDs weird.\n\nFor most other countries, the progression is Bachelors -&gt; Masters -&gt; PhD. You don't even start a PhD unless you already have a masters. As such, many are able to finish their PhD in 3-4 years. Some fields at some universities in the US do this as well.\n\nHowever, many do not. Many fields at many universities in the US follow the progression of Bachelors -&gt; PhD. They don't omit the masters, they just lump it into the PhD. So many PhDs in the US will do 2 years of coursework, then will do \"quals\" where they find out if they can finish the PhD. This coursework + quals is what everyone else calls a Masters.\n\nIt's also why (again, predominately American) PhDs will talk about \"Mastering out\" of their PhD. This is where a PhD candidate who has passed their quals quits their PhD program, and because they'd done all the work for a Masters, will recieve a Masters in exchange for the work they done so far. This is the joke in the US about the only people who have a masters in Physics are those who failed to get a PhD in physics.\n\nMeanwhile, in most other countries, we get Masters first. There's no \"Mastering out\", because we already have the Masters.\n\nTo answer you question, for DE, funding is guaranteed for 4 years, though this is extendable.

So I went ahead and got a master's in animal behavior and welfare, and I *never* would have gotten into the PhD program that I'm in now without that extra degree. My advisor specifically recruited me to the program because I had that degree. \n\nThat said, I went abroad for my master's and the program only lasted one full year (September to September), and I had graduated with a BA in three years so for me getting the master's was really just using that typical fourth year. So overall it was a very smart move for my situation in terms of going forward in the subject I wanted, being able to have an exciting experience abroad, saving some time and money through a one year program rather than 2-3 years, etc. I think that if it has been a choice between going for a PhD or a 2-3 year master's, I might have tried harder to find a PhD right away, but I also wouldn't have had as many opportunities due to my lack of experience with my area of interest. \n\nI was a generally good student as an undergrad, went in with an undergraduate research fellowship so I had years of research experience before grad school, graduated summa cum laude, multiple internships, etc, and I still would have had a really hard time getting into a PhD program that fit what I wanted to do right away. I'm not saying that to discourage you, and you still have time to get your GPA up and get some other experiences that will boost your resume (undergraduate research is a big one), but my thinking is, if you're nervous about the PhD, do the Master's. It's still fairly rigorous, and may give you a boost with PhD applications because you will have already had postgraduate experience. Maybe you can look for schools that have both Master's and PhD programs in your subject, and then you may be able to move into the PhD program once you've finished the Master's?

This is especially crucial if applying to dual degree or joint programs. I've heard of some joint programs passing applications back and forth between departments, and it's easier to get your app tossed out if guidelines aren't followed, etc. Good luck with the application cycle tho.

Simplified, crwativity is joining 2 or more thigs that have never been combined before. One component of creativity to be aware of is willingness to break rules while you are thinking. \n\nWhen you are trying to be creative the most important rule is pass NO judgement on the soundness or practicality or anything else, of the idea. What we know from research is that as soon as you turn on your judging critical brain creativity disappears. Later on you judge the idwas but that proocess should be kept away from idea generation. Being willing to look foolish and make mistakes also helps.\n\nYou have to practice suspending judgement to get good at it (at the appropriate times of course) and even force yourself. One way to do that is by forcing quantity...the more ideas you generate or are forced to generate, the more likely you are to have some novel ideas. One exercise is to look at a situation and challenge yourself to come up with 10 hypotheses about how it might work. And then 10 more and then 10 more to the point you say it is impossible! And at that point do 10 more...because that is when you get a bit silly, sarcastic, rude and stop following all the rules that prevent unusual connections. You just look for ideas, any ideas. And what we find is one of those crazy rule breaking ideas triggers something that is creative and do-able and practical that you would never have thought of. \n\nIt really helps if you are willing to play with the topic. Collect cartoons and jokes in the area as they are often funny because they play with perspective and give you a unique look at the assumptions you are making. Assumptions should aways be reconsidered.\n\nMy favorite technique is to cobine something rando with your chalenge..like an elephant. How is your problem like an elephant?

I am from the US and in a US English PhD program, so while I don't know much about how being an international student might affect things, I will do my best to answer.\n\nRe: unsolicited applications: yes, you can absolutely apply even if you don't have connections! The program I'm in now was not one I had any connection to prior to applying. This is totally normal in the US. You can also reach out to professors you'd be interested in working with prior to applying (and grad students too, to get a feel for the department culture).\n\nRe: teaching/stipends: I absolutely recommend only applying to programs that fully fund their grad students. Typically, if a program has you teaching (called an \"assistantship\" here in case the terminology is different), that work covers your tuition plus an additional stipend (whether it's a \"livable\" stipend is a different manner, sadly). Based on my own experience, I would also look into programs that offer a variety of teaching experience, rather than just teaching comp 1 over and over again. In my program, for instance, I have been able to teach comp, creative writing, self-designed upper-level undergrad writing seminars, and technical communication (intro to lit classes are also an option for me, but I am comp/rhet rather than lit focused). \n\nAlso take programs' placement rates into consideration. The most highly-ranked and well-known programs (e.g. Cornell, Harvard, Stanford) haven't necessarily seen their graduates getting tenure-track jobs of late (if that's the career path you're interested in). I go to an R1 university that isn't necessarily known for its humanities programs (it's more of a STEM school), but we have had fantastic placement rates because of the variety of teaching experience we get. Unfortunately, my PhD program has closed its admissions for the foreseeable future due to Covid and staffing issues or I would recommend it specifically.\n\nThis isn't something you asked directly, but I would also look into the regional cultures and political leanings of different parts of the US. I got my MA in Nebraska for example, which is very conservative and I recall some of the international students having a tough time with the local culture because it was so different from their own values-wise. Universities themselves are typically more liberal, but the surrounding community can still very much impact your day-to-day life and happiness. \n\nFinally, definitely look into the resources schools offer for international graduate students. Each school should have its own area of the website devoted to this topic (if not, that would be another red flag for me). \n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to DM me! I'd be happy to help if I can.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/o7mj8w/german_trying_to_understand_us_english_lit_phd/h2zqk5n/"}, "3076": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "warm_content", "Date": 1624627309, "Score": 2, "Body": "I'm a US student currently enrolled in a US PhD literature program.\n\n1. You are not expected to have any relationships with anyone who works in the program you're applying to. With that said, it's considered normal, and in some cases good, for you to contact professors with whom you'd like to work before you apply. Your statement of purpose should name the professors that you are interested in working with.\n2. All reputable PhD literature programs include a full tuition scholarship and a small stipend (usually between $15,000 and $30,000 per year depending on the wealth and prestige of the program). In most cases, these stipends are tied to a teaching assistantship, which essentially means that you will be required to teach for most of the time you're in the program. If you're interested, you can find a list of stipends and funding (updated 2018, so it's a little old) here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNJR4IhOJ56zd7zLuVSUK7h054dBRNvyiC7iStCOsxo/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNJR4IhOJ56zd7zLuVSUK7h054dBRNvyiC7iStCOsxo/edit#gid=0)If a PhD program does not offer you \"full funding\" (that is, a tuition scholarship as well as a teaching assistantship), you should not attend the program.

The standard graduate workload is, at the least, one book per week per course. Some courses assign two books per week; most courses will assign one book per week plus some critical material. Normally, grad students take three classes per semester. This means that you should be prepared to read an average of 3-4 books per week. If each book is an average of 300 pages, this means 900-1,200 pages per week, or between 128-170 pages per day. Some weeks will be lighter and some will be heavier. On top of the assigned reading, you will also be expected to read for your own independent research, which I will explain in more detail in the next bullet point. \n2. You are normally required to produce what's called a \"seminar paper\" for each course that you're in. These range from 15-25 pages in length, and the average length is about 20 pages (7,000 words or so). Because you'll be taking three classes, this means that you should be prepared to write 60 pages of formal research per semester. On top of this, most seminars require weekly informal writing assignments. A good rule of thumb for an excellent seminar paper is that you should have one source per page, although you can usually get away with far fewer references. This means that, on top of the assigned reading, you should be prepared to read between 30 and 60 secondary sources as part of your research. In total, then, for a fifteen-week semester, you will read a total of 45-60 books along with 30 to 60 secondary sources, some of which will be journal articles and some of which will be scholarly monographs. \n3. During the summer, I don't read as much because I'm not very disciplined, but I try to read at least 100 pages per day. During the semester, I read about twice as much--that is, 200 pages per day. \n4. Almost nobody is able to complete all of this reading. Part of grad school is learning to pretend to have read something that you did not have enough time to read. A friend of mine got all the way through a Master's degree without having completely read any of the assigned material. This is obviously not preferable, but if you're smart, you can get through a literature PhD without doing all of the reading.

Positive recommendations from professors with a good reputation can make a big difference. And of course a professor trashing you in their letter will not look good. \n\n3 - Research experience. This should be important in general, but what exactly would a program expect really depends on several factors. So, I recommend checking how things work for the \"universities/countries/research field\" of your interest. It seems sometimes a program doesn't require much research experience (although it still helps a lot) while other programs have high expectations (and can require research proposals, things like that). \n\n4 - Skills and knowledge that are typical for the track you want to research. For example, more quantitative types of research can expect to see many courses on calculus with A grades, or coding skills. \n\n5 - Fit, especially research fit.

I'm analytical chemistry in the US. Got a master's before I got accepted for PhD. \n\nI had a rough start to my undergraduate career. Failed a class and had to repeat at least three overall due to low grades. Had probably three W's as well. Once I found out how cool research was I changed my lifestyle a lot and tried to turn things around. My final GPA was about 3.1 at the end of my undergrad. I ended my undergrad with 2 years of research and about 5 quarters of TA experience. \n\nHaving barely made it in the grand scheme of things I did my master's to figure out if I wanted to keep going and to fix my grades as well. I ended up with nearly a 4.0 out of my masters. Overall this still only brought my cumulative to something like a 3.5. I started working for a second research group during my first year as a master's student in order to try and get a research fellowship. That fellowship paid for a full summer of fulltime work. Overall leaving the master's I had 2 more years of research, including one summers of full time work, one summer as instructor of record, as well as 2 more academic years of TA'ing at least two classes/quarter. Full thesis master's path. \n\nMy first year of applications I sent out 5 applications. Should have done more but at the time I was finding a job as a backup, finishing my thesis, and doing classes and such. Of them, 2 were reach schools and 3 were backups. I got 4 denials and one never responded. \n\nSecond year of applications, I sent out 6 applications though this time they were much more targeted. I completely rewrote my personal statement and I'd say I spent about 2 months seriously just workshopping it. There were 2 reach, 2 mid, and 2 backups. I sent in one late application to another backup. I got accepted to both mid, and one backup. Two rejections and two schools ghosted me. The backup school then actually just refused to continue with the acceptance process and ghosted me before I could do the visitation, so I assume my acceptance was on accident or something. Of my two remaining options, another of them rescinded my offer due to COVID starting and my taking too long to choose. \n\nIn this time (two years of applications) , my 2 of friends with lower grades in classes pertaining to their fields but better overall GPA's were accepted to PhD programs.  Both went straight from undergrad to PhD. I would say that in my experience a low GPA is a very large factor but you can overcome it. The shitty deal is that it really just depends on so many factors that you can't control, that you have to try really hard on those you can. If there are only 2 slots in the group you want into, and someone else has better grades, than you might not even get to the PI to look at before you get rejected and it **SUCKS**. \n\nSo much of the process is administrative BS that has nothing to do with you as a person, but you as a sheet of paper. One of the guys that got into a program before me sent out 6 letters and got 5 rejections. But his acceptance was a UC Davis! And he got rejected from 3 pretty well known backup schools. One of the undergrads in my school did only one application to the University of Illinois for an astrochemistry program, and she was accepted in the first round. I wish I could tell you what they will pick or deny you on, and I wish you could tell me the same. The real situation is that you just have to cover all of the bases as well as you can, knowing that you will receive some denials for bases that you might have covered differently having known some super specific piece of information that you don't and never will. \n\nAfter all of this above you also have to consider that there are some schools, in the US at least, that still won't pay grad students a livable wage. Sometimes it's hard to find that information out before you get your offer. Depending on your situation, those offers could just go on the dead pile. This didn't happen to me, but people in my cohort have this experience. Plenty of schools, mine included, are totally fine though. I just wanted to throw that out there. \n\n**TLDR**: Yes, grades will end up holding you back but so will literally everything on your application when it's under the wrong people's noses. I agree with the other poster, in that the only way to get into a program is to put lots of dedication into lots of applications. The pool requirements are just too unknown. You have to do both though.

They always say it's because people in less developed countries deserve a chance, but they always end up taking advantage of these people.\n\n2. The \"we're a family\" attitude. If the boss organizes BBQs, but also constantly talks about how hard everyone works, that means the BBQ is a shitty paint job to cover up the abuse. Sort of like an abusive parent buying their kid an ice-cream when they sober up and realize what they did. \n\n3. Praising their employees/students for being more interested in the science/education rather than the money. This usually means that they are not paying their employees fairly, or they're abusing them financially and they aren't interested in changing that any time soon.\n\nJust start a conversation about money with them. The more they're bothered by it, the more they wish they could abuse people.\n\nIn science money is usually scarce, that doesn't mean you can't have an honest conversation about it.\n\n4.

Even though I was years into my program when the pandemic started, this past year and a half has been just awful; by now it has me questioning everything from my competence to the existential purpose of academia. I began my dissertation during quarantine, and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just \u201cout of my depth,\u201d as you said, and incompetent to the work, or if it\u2019s a product of the isolation of the last year and the demoralizing academic job market. I believe it\u2019s the latter, but a subset of faculty in my department don\u2019t seem to recognize or care about the effects of the pandemic and assume it\u2019s the former. I\u2019m finding it hard to consistently tune those voices out.\n\nI don\u2019t have much advice, especially for your job concerns. I just want to affirm that your feelings are valid, and say that I believe it more reflects the realities of the broken academic system than your abilities.\n\nOn an optimistic note, I\u2019ve been in a rut for many months that has recently turned more into a depressive spiral about my work, but despite that I somehow managed to find a spark of inspiration the other day and have actually been somewhat interested again in reading and writing about my topic. So, there are these ebbs and flows in the mental/emotional experience of research. You have to trust that given enough time, the flow will always come again. In the meantime, seek out peer support (writing/sharing groups?) and kind, generous faculty members with whom you can just chat about your research. There\u2019s a lot of advice about \u201cwriting every day\u201d as a practice of consistent, low-stakes engagement with your topic (see the book on dissertating, \u201cWrite No Matter What,\u201d and plenty of others). For me, sitting down to write is always going to feel high-stakes when I\u2019m in a rut, but just chatting with someone supportive is a better low-stakes way to keep in pleasant contact with my work even when I don\u2019t feel up to \u201cproducing\u201d something.

You need to be an expert in your field which means you need to read and understand most (if not all) of the papers in you specific dissertation area (and associated areas). You also need to come up with a dissertation topic worthy of spending a couple of years on and that demonstrates your ability within your field.\n\nIf you can collect and analyze your data in a week then that would be amazing. Depends on the field really what is reasonable, but I would expect most phds take much much longer than that for their dissertation. The level of analysis and the questions you are asking require much more depth than in your masters degree. I took an additional 2 years of course work for my specific program, then my candidacy exam and then 3 years now on my dissertation. I know some fields have the masters and PhD program built to transition into each other so you may not have the additional course work years. \n\nBut generally I would say the level of background reading and knowledge you need is much higher than the masters before you even really start your dissertation. Then you need to write that up as your literature review and theory development. This is much more than a couple of rounds of revisions that is typical in a master processes. Personally I did probably 30-40 rounds of revisions on this part alone between all the questioning of my questions and theory and then actually writing it all up. But my supervisor is also super senior and super nit picky. The benefit is my proposal was a breeze with hardly any revisions and I know from others dissertations that defences are similar for his students so it\u2019s a trade off there. Then for me I had to design my experiment to test my hypothesis and every piece of this is analyzed and critiqued, until your supervisor is satisfied, and then there is (for me) running the experiment and collecting the data. And then doing the analysis. As well, in my field at least we do a lot more data analysis for our dissertation than a typical paper. We have to show we tested everything and thought of as much as we could; and actually present those results fully and not just footnote them. Etc. Basically everything is just way more in depth than a typical research paper and definitely than a masters thesis etc. Getting your doctorate in a field means you are an expert in that field (and especially on your research topic) and so you have to do the work to become an expert. Plus there are a lot of other obligations. We do brown bags, research conferences, weekly seminars with research faculty from other schools who come in and present their papers, and I\u2019ve worked as an RA and as a co-author on 4 other research papers that are currently into the publishing stage. As someone wanting to stay in academics (I do have a assistant prof position starting in the fall), having these other research papers was critical\nto getting a job in academics and will be critical in my field to be able to get tenure. \n\nExactly what your program will look like is very field dependent though. I\u2019d find some people in a PhD in your field at some schools you think you might like to attend and chat with them about the process. The number of research projects. Length of time it takes to get a research project published. And exactly how the program is structured is very dependent on your field. \n\nBut tldr: a PhD dissertation is just much more in depth than a master program or even a regular published paper is. And every step of the research process is typically vetted and reviewed by at least your supervisor before you move onto next stage. Plus there are a lot of other important aspects of the program like other research papers and other research tangential activities to do as well.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/o7x72o/using_statistician_help_with_research/h3hjkqo/"}, "3709": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bioinformatics_manic", "Date": 1625002364, "Score": 8, "Body": "Quit... \n\nA P.H.D is just a means to an end.

I'm in Education for my PhD, I did Secondary Education (Biology) for my previous degree, I would never touch a pure Biology PhD research with a stick. But I love being in Education for my PhD because all I have to do is take the content course and the method courses (statistics mostly) to help me write a comprehensive exam on a topic of interest related to STEM Education or something, then design a dissertation around that or STEM teaching methods or something.

E.g. of degrees in Education that can fit your STEM interest and research include Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, Educational Psychology, etc.\n\nFollowup: If you want to be in teaching for the longest haul, I suggest trying to get a PhD in education because no way you want to be an elementary, middle school or high school teacher for the rest of your career. At some point, you will get tired and angry at the policy makers and you will probably want to contribute to the decision making at the \"top\" somewhat even if you do not become a full time Educational Manager or Administrator at a school or district. Having that PhD early on now will make your career journey as a teacher easier in case anything happens in the future, it lends credibility to your teaching craft, and can open doors to other part time gigs as a consultant in the Educational area. Please,  strongly consider getting a PhD in an Education area or even Curriculum and Teaching. We need Teacher Researchers. If you are struggling in pure science and love teaching, trust me you will do great in an Education PhD (Been there, done that). All the best!\n\nMy suggestion is to speak with your graduate college office, identify programs in the school/college of education you are interested in, speak with the chair in the Edu programs of interest and figure out how to transfer to that department. DON'T QUIT and try to come back. It is harder to get in from the outside, you probably already know this from your current PhD admission. Much easier to do an internal transfer as a current student rather than prospective. Hopefully, you will get funding.

But i've seen people get GTAs their whole time in my department\ud83d\ude02 I just was not their favorite student to pick for such limited GTA positions. But you can always get a job on campus as a GA in some other office or GRA in another research center (I do not recommend this) or just a get a job as a staff at your Uni and qualify for in-state tuition.

While there are aspects of the PhD that you're not really aware of until you get into it, the core premise of the PhD you're seeking, namely one that requires large amounts of independent bench research, is such a major consideration that it's hard to accept as an oversight. You simply don't go into a PhD in genetics if you don't like research. Even one semester of undergrad lab experience would have given the experience of not wanting to do experiments. I've had students in the past in the undergrad level that did get research experience. Many of them love science, but hated research. They didn't jump into a PhD because they knew that wasn't the case and looked into other career options.\n\nIn fact, what you're describing (namely teaching science) *can be done with a Masters*, as adjunct professorships do exist to my understanding for people with a Masters degree. And there's science education PhD programs that appear to more fit what you're describing here.\n\n&gt;A PhD is a means to an end. My end is teaching. So then I have to consider, is another 5 years worth it when I am qualified to get a teaching job right now. May not be collegiate, but I know I would be happy.\n\nIf your end was always teaching, why did you think the PhD was the means to that end when it clearly isn't the case?\n\nYou have to really ask yourself, why did you get into a PhD program hating the research portion, if your end goal truly was something else that was wholly available with a different path? Was it an oversight of information? Was it a misunderstanding of what you wanted? Was it a lack of experience? If you went into the PhD with just \"I like science,\" then we got problems.\n\nWhich goes back to the other comment. How do you know you want to teach? Have you actually *done* teaching in a high school or elementary school level? Are you a substitute teacher right now? Are you looking into qualifications?\n\nHow do you know that, by going into a teaching position, you're not going to be wasting another 2-5 years trying to get into and finding it's not for you? More than just saying that you want it?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oafe1o/considering_leaving_phd_to_teach/h3lhp53/"}, "3889": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Flashy-Editor-3785", "Date": 1625082625, "Score": 4, "Body": "my guess is that it didn't work at as his Facebook page indicates.
