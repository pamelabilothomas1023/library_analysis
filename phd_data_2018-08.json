I've been through my fair share of bad supervisors. I changed after my first year bc my first supervisor was a complete psycho. (For example: She would call you afterhours to yell at you while your colleagues couldn't hear. If you didn't answer the phone, she would yell at you in her office the next day for hours on end.) I changed supervisor at the moment my current supervisor announced he couldn't work with her anymore. This also meant dropping all the research I had done the first year. I'm on a project written by 3 professors so I could only \"chose\" between them. My official PI after changing away from the first one, was actually a decent guy and researcher but he never was involved much due to circumstances (one of which being that he got terminally ill after my 2nd year). In practice, my current PI has been in charge ever since I changed to the other one. Him admittedly not knowing anything about my subject didn't stop him from deciding what my first study should be, while I was in vacation. I had several doubts, all of which he ignored. When the first study didn't work out, we made the changes I had suggested previously but now all of a sudden he claimed that he had always suggested these adaptations and not me. This dynamic was the same for every study I did. I never was allowed to even critically think about the studies. Voicing my concerns would just lose me large amounts of time, bc discussions could last months on end where he didn't even listen or consider what I was saying. He just blocked my progress until I agreed with him. Ofcourse agreeing with him also cost time bc there would always be mistakes that I'd had to correct afterwards. This led to me working extreme hours to make up for time lost, often being sick bc of fatigue. Voicing my concerns would only lead to him saying things like \"this is the way the research process goes\",  or \"you're afraid to lose control\". In the process, I was continuously degraded by him. Ombudsperson, etc did nothing. Fast-forward to 3 months before my funding ran out. I had finished 3 manuscript (that I wasn't even proud of, bc there were none of my ideas in them) and at that moment we find out that my supervisor had made a mistake in the scripts for the analysis (which I also hadn't been allowed to write myself) of all my studies. Everything had to be re-analyzed and rewritten. At this point, I couldn't take it anymore and was at home sick for a month. When I came back, my official PI (the fairly decent one) passed away. This was communicated to me in a horrible way. The only conversation anyone at my university ever had with me about him passing was when the dean discussed whom my next official supervisor would be. I voiced my concerns which luckily led to a decent professor being involved as co-supervisor, but the horrible one still had to be my main one. Afterwards we discuss this with both my supervisors. This is the first conversation I have with my current PI after having been ill for a month and learning that my previous PI passed away. He starts saying that he has \"prepared\"  for this meeting and brings up a discussion about the analysis we'd been having for 3 years and that if I wouldn't follow him, he can't support my research and be my PI (as if I would mind honestly, but apparently this would be problematic for finishing my PhD). And this is the guy who will get all the credit if I do finish...\n\nIf I do quit, him not getting credit would be the sole reason.\n\nSorry for the long rant. Anyway, I truly do get how you feel.

Maybe a PhD student can give better insights but  I've been in a research lab for a while now and I remember coming to my lab on the first day having the exact same feelings you're having right now. All these amazing researchers and it didn't help that they were these tall and well built guys. I was intimidated to say the least. Here is what I have to say:\n\n1. Everyone has the feeling at different points during their research that they do not know what they are doing. Trust yourself that you will understand what you're doing and what you'll want to do.\n2. Talk to your lab mates. Ask them all the questions you have - about your supervisor/PI, about lab culture, about their research - especially about their research. Do not be scared that your questions are stupid.\n3. Volunteer to do presentations once you have an idea about what you want to do. Generally, people are helpful and will give you ideas as to how to proceed.\n4. Be proactive about your research. Do not wait for your supervisor to sit down with you for a meeting. I like to schedule meetings with them at least once every two weeks. In our lab, we like to call it \"managing your supervisor\". Even if I don't have anything to show in the meeting I just go and have a little chat.\n5. If you have flexibility to try out different labs in your first few semesters, do that. Make sure your supervisors and lab mates do not have a toxic lab culture. You have to spend four years with them, you have to be happy working with them.\n6. Jump at all conference opportunities. Posters are easier than papers in the initial time of research. Make posters, talk about your areas to everyone in the conference. Get their opinions. I cannot stress how important it is to talk to your peers about research. Don't isolate yourself. (Side note: when you do visit other places for conferences, keep a day or three extra, and actually travel)\n7. Know that the more you get to know something, the more you'll realize that you don't know a lot. Be aware of the imposter syndrome.\n8. You see a lot of horror stories on the internet about PhDs but that's only because people vent about bad experiences and not about good experiences.\n9. \" I\u2019m just all around worried about the experience, worried I won\u2019t be  able to design  experiments, worried I won\u2019t be able to understand the maths behind what I do, worried I won\u2019t know how to perform the data  analysis etc etc. \" - take it one at a time. Research is not one aha moment at the end, the aha stretches over months and doesn't even feel like an accomplishment.\n10. Enjoy your research. Don't rush it, quality beats quantity in terms of papers and research.\n11. Do you have to teach as well? If you like it, then by all means teach. I've appreciated the subject matter more while teaching. You learn so much\n12. Take up hobbies. You need to have things to do besides your research. You don't want to burn out by working too much. Work/life balance doesn't mean too much in grad school, but it helps to have it. I know of many people who treated their PhD as a Monday-Friday 9-5 job to focus on raising their family and they did brilliantly.\n13. You get what you put into your research. Its your baby, no one is going to care about it more than you, so do your best be be self-motivated\n\nThat's about all I have.

I think that's what gives it the respect it gets (if you choose your topic right) and what drives rates of depression and anxiety in PhD candidates through the roof. The people I don't see struggling too much are people who have advisors with a lot of corporate connections. Such people can directly see how much effect their work has on improving actual usable technologies. An advisor that relies on academic grants or university funding generally can't offer that peace of mind, which drives post-defense anxiety up high. Not to mention that such an advisor can't offer any additional financial means. For example, a professor I worked with as an undergraduate had had a PhD advisor (back in his day) who owned a consulting company. So every summer he'd work for consultant's pay and every two semesters he'd work for the TA pay. Even then, as he was saying it, you could see his expression change into a grin about having been able to get paid in a situation most PhD students couldn't for whichever reason (advisor insisted they stay on campus, didn't find opportunities, didn't have time, etc.).\n\nI don't know what to tell you about being happy with your PhD. It's a 5 year program that leaves you dirt poor. Maybe the UK is different, but in the US your income dictates your social circles. If someone invites you to a pretentious bar or even a slightly overpriced restaurant, you won't be able to pay for the experience and will wind up not going. When you go on a date and tell the person you don't own a car, they'll be horrified. Your social circles therefore quickly end up being people who are also financially struggling in their mid or late 20s, which is not necessarily the best (nor worst, but certainly not best) crowd of people. \n\nAs for depression and anxiety, I don't know anyone who isn't battling those while battling the PhD. But then again I don't know many smart people who can handle average jobs without some depression either. It's up to you if you want to be depressed because you're temporarily poor and overworked or because you're stuck in a mediocre job for a lifetime. That is one thing a PhD does guarantee you: you will never work an ordinary job. It might not be paid well, it might not be interesting, it might not be what you wanted it to be, but it is always going to be something other than a predictable and mundane reality of a 9-5.

The word \u201cAssociate\u201d in this context is kind of meaningless - same as in \u201cAssociate Account Manager\u201d, \u201cAssociate Sales Executive\u201d. The word Associate is used to denote a more junior position below the rest of the title, so for me it renders the title of Professor no longer unique and also means that the rank achieved is just a junior version of the one above. In the corporate world, some companies are stuffed full of \u201cEuropean Junior Vice President of XXXX\u201d, \u201cGlobal Junior Vice President of XXXX\u201d, \u201cGeneral Manager\u201d, \u201cManaging Director\u201d etc - leaving us none the wiser what their seniority level is and simply looking like a grandiose title has been awarded, that is simultaneously meaningless. \n\nAlthough the title of Reader may seem unusual since it implies \u201cone who reads\u201d (which is arguably pretty apt anyway) we probably shouldn\u2019t rely too much on the actual titles to infer what the ranks mean. After all, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all had the conversations with friends and families about wanting to get a Lectureship, followed by them assuming that a \u201cLecturer\u201d is simply one who lectures. Of course, we know that Lecturer is an academic rank that reflects your ability in research, and that you\u2019ve progressed beyond working for somebody else with their grants and are starting to strike it out alone with your own independent research programme.

If you get great funding then the experience will be even better! I regret some aspects of my decision to pursue a PhD (mainly student loans), but I can't imagine having made a different choice because the academic life has so many rewards: you get to learn alongside other passionate learners, conduct research in (hopefully) a supportive environment, and postpone working for the man out in the regular world (let's be honest, many of us shudder at the idea of a typical 9-5). If you think you have the gumption to keep doing what you're doing for 5 more years then go for it. \n\nRegarding contacting scholars you might want to work with: yes, you should do it, but timing is important. Are you planning on submitting PhD applications this cycle (usually Nov-Jan)? If so, you should definitely be researching the departments wherein the people you might want to work are appointed, reading the scholars' papers, becoming familiar with the schools' various programs and funding opportunities for grad students, and considering how you might fit in with what's going on in the departments. Once you get a list going of people you might want to work with then you can find out if they are taking grad students by asking via email. Sometimes faculty members are going on leave or are not taking any more students due to being overloaded. I am not sure how your field works, but sometimes applications actually require you list who you want to work with. Even if they don't, your statement of purpose should always outline who you want to work with and why. \n\nIf you're not yet ready to apply to programs, I suggest you keep working on your masters and ask PhDs a lot of questions their decisions to pursue doctoral study and about how they made contact with faculty. I was completing an MA in the humanities and was encouraged to email scholars whose work made an impact on me. I ended up contacting one scholar to thank her for her work and she invited me to apply to the department's doctoral program. I hadn't even planned on pursing a PhD, but it ended up working out. My partner, who just got into a STEM PhD, contacted multiple faculty members after much research to verify that they were taking grad students and to find out if they could suggest any readings that might help improve his knowledge of the field. This helped him narrow who he wanted to work with once he found out exactly what kind of research they were conducting most recently. \n\nI could go on and on about this. I hope something here is helpful. A PhD is a big commitment, but it doesn't have to be mysterious. I am a huge proponent of sharing knowledge in these types of forums so feel free to post more questions as you get further in your process. \n\nGood luck!

My background is in Engineering but my PhD was more in Numerical Modeling &amp; Machine Learning / Deep Learning. After my second year of PhD, I started thinking about what I wanted to do after graduation.  I wanted something that'll pay at least six figures base. I initially considered Management Consulting but the 75%+ travel time didn't really appeal to me. It took months of soul-searching and figuring out exactly what I wanted out of life post-PhD but eventually, I settled on Data Science for a number of reasons:\n\n  1. Most jobs pay $100K base for PhDs (living in the mid-west)\n\n 2. Most jobs will allow me to work from home part of the time (10% - 25%).\n\n 3. I won't be limited to a specific industry (i.e. more jobs that I qualify for)\n\nSo, I started working to bridge the gap between the skills I already had and what was required for most data science jobs from Linkedin / Glassdoor job posts. It took about 18 months of preparation but I finally got offers that were willing to pay more than I expected. The fact that I was an Insight Data Science fellow certainly helped. I accepted the best offer and started working six months before my final PhD defense. \n\nMy advice to you is to first conduct a rigorous search of all the career paths available to you. (e.g. [alternative careers for PhDs](https://cheekyscientist.com/top-10-list-of-alternative-careers-for-phd-science-graduates/)) and think about how much work you need to do to bridge the skills gap for each. Then make a decision based on what appeals to you most. If you do a good job at identifying all the essential skills for the job, the transition from academia is quite smooth. Most PhDs make the mistake of waiting until it's too late to begin their career planning and job search. I'll advise you to spend as much time on your career planning / skills development, as you spend on your PhD, especially after the first couple of years. For me, I used the skills development as a means of escape for the periods of frustration in my research, when i couldn't make headway in my work anyway. And so my whole PhD experience was much less stressful than it is for most.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/982di8/what_industries_are_you_guys_looking_to_go_into/e4crmx2/"}, "622": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "milesmac", "Date": 1534516429, "Score": 5, "Body": "... and make your bed when you get up.

The PG loans pretty much require you to have a high paying job immediately after graduation. Considering the state of entry level avast positions, that is unlikely. I therefore would not recommend a PG loan. Any funding you could get would therefore be piecemeal and unsecure. Everybody I know who has taken that route is incredibly stressed about finances. I would not recommend that to anyone, especially to someone with a history of mental health issues.\n\nI would suggest your only real option is to be self-funded. If you do not have a secure job which will last you the duration of your studies and which will pay you enough to live without worry, I would not recommend a self-funded part time PhD.\n\nBefore you consider financial options, you should also think about where you want to do a PhD. With your academic track record you will not be accepted for PhD study everywhere, even with your extenuating circumstances. PhD study is very difficult, last month a good friend of mine was let go from his PhD because his work was not good enough, despite having a stellar academy record previously. I think it would be unlikely for you to be accepted for a PhD at a high-ranking university. \n\nAlthough you may not know many people who have done a PhD with a mental illness. I know several, including myself, who have developed mental health issues primarily caused by the stress, solitude, and workload of the PhD. You must take the mental health impact of doing a PhD into account. There is no collegiate atmosphere for most PhD students, you often work alone both in that you will often be in your own workspace with nobody else, and that you have limited options to talk to colleagues about your work because they will not fully understand it.\n\nOf course, you really need to decide why you want to do a PhD. If your motivations are not strongly motivated for the right reasons, you will not survive. Everyone I know who started a PhD for status, or because they didn't have anything else to do, eventually decided it was not worth it.\n\nStill, if I were you, I would do a research masters (MRes/MPhil) first. Or, ideally, try to find a 2+2 course with the option to continue to PhD, or bail out with an MPhil (1+3 with a single year MRes/MPhil don't exist as far as I am aware). That would give you the experience of a solitudinal research intensive environment to see if you actually enjoy, and think you can endure, it. Plus, it gives you the chance to improve your academic record to potentially launch you towards a PhD at a highly ranked university. The reason I am suggesting higher ranked unis is because they have far greater finances to fund mental health and wellbeing teams, which I expect would be of paramount importance to you individually.\n\nWhatever you decide, good luck.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9aenul/considering_a_phd_but_i_have_mental_health_issues/e4v8qz9/"}, "903": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "XMGrymigi", "Date": 1535301378, "Score": 1, "Body": "To emphasise what the original comment said; I know three people who have taken out loans.
