This year in particular, ESPECIALLY, sucks. My best advice is carve out a day where you can truly try and relax. Don't think about the PhD at all. If it means you have to do extra work some other time, fine, but also the world won't end if you don't.\n\nSecond, holy shit, as someone who also fucking coasted through life until my PhD, I can agree. It's wild as fuck to be hit in the face with how hard this is. And, for me at least specifically, it was the research part. I straight killed it in coursework--department thinks I'm the bomb and it was just as \"easy\" as bachelor's and master's was... And I have been a fucking **disaster** at research. I'm slow, I second-guess every single thing I do, I hide my work instead of workshopping it... It's just impossible. I'm way behind and 2020 has not helped a smidge since not only is it doubly stressful but all the fucking ARCHIVES are closed (aaaaaaaaah!!!)\n\nIt all got a lot easier when I realized that it was OK for me to admit I wanted no part in TT job search or research-based academic work. I remembered that I have a ton of skills and experiences that lend themselves to a wide range of really fulfilling and interesting work opportunities that will allow me to support my family and--most importantly--leave that shit at the office. It's really helped me to just put my head down and crank out work.\n\nAs for how you start--it's day by day, no question. Some days you gotta find a 5-min task you can FORCE yourself to do instead of reddit/email/doomscrolling, and then from there find a 10-min task, and work up to bigger tasks. Other days it's easier, and you just gotta run with it on those days. Either way, manageable task lists are a HUGE help.\n\nAnd perspective is important: no one in the academy--except a handful of absolute insane sociopaths--is doing good work right now. We're all just doing the best we can. Ask for help if you need it, and remember that a PhD is training: you're not EXPECTED to come in and be a rockstar, and the job market is shitty enough that if you thought you'd land a TT job even if you WERE feeling really confident, then you were getting poor advising.\n\nSo with a little less pressure on yourself, maybe just try and find the things about the work you DO enjoy--you're getting paid (not much, admittedly) to spend time developing deep expertise and widely-applicable skills that you can use for a lifetime, and with institutional support and expert mentorship guiding you. That's pretty cool!\n\nEdit: just adding, your point about not being able to fathom wanting your \\*free time\\* work to be MORE academic stuff (grants, articles, side projects, etc., etc.) is 100000% right on the nose and I cannot in a million years see myself enjoying that world.

I think I had very strong reasons to pursue a PhD, to want to have a specific professor as advisor, at a specific university. \n\nAnd I would be very careful with statements like \"I know I can do it.\" Maybe you do. But how can you really know? What evidence do you have for that? If you really do know you can do it, then this can also help you to develop a reason to do a PhD. However, it's not common for an applicant to really know that. \n\nYou can see a lot of people who believe they will become \"obsessed with it\" and then after the 1st semester feel completely lost and without motivation. If you are likely to become obsessed, can you show that you are already somehow obsessed with it? That was also part of my reasons, I was already on that path for quite some time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jnl854/application_personal_statement_why_do_i_want_it/gb285e2/"}, "311": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "robot-brain", "Date": 1604448516, "Score": 4, "Body": "I wasn't trying to put you down, but your post echos more of a humble-brag rather than something positive.

A kid in a candy store if you like. Do you know much about 2d materials? Fascinating areas of study.\n\nThe only thing I know for certain is the getting out of my job. There's not much round here for me and I'm committed to the area. But that's only the obvious reason I want this.  Real reason is learning and proving I've got it in me. Challenge. Subject matter. New career prospects after this study. All other reasons.\n\nThe issue is how to write a statement that sells me? I have the drive but I'm kind of struggling focus it onto one area as I reckon that will give me my best chance.\n\nI hope I've explained things better.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jnl854/application_personal_statement_why_do_i_want_it/gb44ngf/"}, "350": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "joketem", "Date": 1604497092, "Score": 3, "Body": "I suppose they would have something like that!

I see people talking more about the specific quantitative courses you have taken (e.g., linear algebra, econometrics, statistics) than GPA. You are expected to be very good at this type of thing. \n\nGMAT matters, particularly the quant score for Accounting (usually I see 50Q or 51Q). Scores around 700 are quite common to find among business PhD applicants, so you may need more than that to be considered strong in that regard. \n\nWork experience is more important in Accounting than in most other types of PhD, but still far from being an absolute necessity. So, I think you're ok. \n\nIt's hard to tell how many hours you will spend working and studying during a PhD. That can change a lot, depending in many different factors. Two students in the same department can have very different experiences in that regard. You may have an advisor who wants you to get very involved with teaching, and another student have an advisor who doesn't want that, for example. \n\nIf you're lucky, I guess you can expect something close to a normal job, about 40 hours a week of intense work. But you need to be prepared to do much more than that, at least sometimes. \n\nOne of the Accounting PhD students I met here wasn't allowed to continue after her 2nd year, she was not able to deal with everything she needed to do. She didn't have another job or anything like that, she was focused on the PhD, she worked and studied like crazy (we sometimes studied together). During my first year, certainly there were periods when I was working/studying about 15 hours a day, and that wasn't enough. Things are better now, but the first two years were insane.\n\nIt's very difficult to get accepted into business-related PhD programs. Even more so if you're talking about programs in the US, since they attract the best of the best from around the world. Selecting the schools carefully is critical, applying widely is typically recommended. It's too soon for you to make a list of schools, you probably will still develop your research interests to a higher level during the MAcc, and that will be important to know which schools may be better for you. \n\nYou will need 3 letters of recommendation to apply. So, you also need to think about that during the MAcc.

I don\u2019t have the examiners report yet so don\u2019t have specifics, but this is what they said in the viva:\n\nThere was enough data, and it was novel and had a clear contribution to knowledge. One big problem was that my results chapters didn\u2019t link together strongly enough- this was partly due to me going through three different supervisors in different fields as the first two left for industry jobs. None of them understood each other\u2019s work, and in order to take me on they wanted me to incorporate some of their research interests, so the project changed focus a lot. It would have been okay if they had a stronger understanding of my work, as anything I\u2019d miss would not be picked up on. I was happy to accommodate this as the chapters all had a logical progression, but it fell apart when it came to some of the details. The chapters did have a common theme, but in hindsight there would have been better ways to tie them in together. For example I looked at a receptor with the last supervisor that releases a molecule I could have been monitoring in experiments I did with the first supervisor where I looked at a panel of similar molecules, had I known my research would change focus to include that receptor. By then there was no time to go back and redo everything as it relied on patient samples. Whilst the experiments all did tie in together with a central theme, there were things like that that when you look back on them they have become oversights. \n\nThe other big problem was quality control of experiments. One particular experimental technique I performed- which made up a large proportion of the results- was conducted without adequate quality control; there were more checks I was supposed to have done that I was not aware of and that my supervisor never mentioned (or maybe didn\u2019t know either). That therefore invalidated all the results. Drug doses were sometimes determined from the literature and previously established in the lab, my supervisor told me to go ahead and follow those, but the examiners said it can\u2019t be based on other papers and dose response should have been performed for all experiments. Luckily for some drugs I did, but not all, so too much of my data is invalid now. It\u2019s ultimately my responsibility and I should have checked with other people instead of just taking my supervisors word for it, however. I should have checked into these things a lot more.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re struggling too. However, I highly recommend finding someone else in the field to double check the technical details. Perhaps another PI in the department? My latest supervisor would meet me weekly and did not pick up on technical details or check my experimental plans too, but is now saying he has provided enough supervision with the weekly meetings... Make sure the methodology is completely sound, try to check with an expert in each methodology that there isn\u2019t something you\u2019ve overlooked.

Identify the best schools for your topic and the professor you want to work with.\n\nContact them, tell them you love their paper, ask them for advice.  They might recommend applying to their program or going to their university.\n\nResearch the school, visit, talk to faculty, gossip with doctoral students, and apply.\n\nThe gossip part is key.

PhDs can be wonderful, but also come with *a lot* of associated stress--integrating into a new lab, project deadlines, long working hours, experimental failures, etc. If you don't address your mental health issues before you start a program I could very easily see things spiraling in a destructive way. PhD programs are working on this, but most don't have great mental health services. ([https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1)) If you're having regular panic attacks and crippling anxiety just thinking about a PhD program then I believe starting one will only lead to disaster. I would also reflect and ask yourself why you want a PhD, or if there are other paths you might want to take that would cause you less stress (staff scientist or industry technician, for example).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo your second point--the professors suggesting you apply now--I would remind you that people often see the path that took them to success as the only path. IE if going directly from undergrad to graduate school worked for them, it should work for you. This isn't true. Everyone has their own path that works for them. Furthermore, once you get out of undergrad paths don't have to be linear anymore--I have a PhD colleague in my lab who started at 22, I have another who started at 34. You should take the time you need, and not worry about how quickly you hit career milestones. Additionally, doing more research before you apply for a PhD (especially if you can parley that into a publication or two) is always going to be a strength on your application. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is all leading up to my point that I don't think you have to listen to these professors **UNLESS** they're your current supervisor or the ones going to be writing your letters of rec. Then it's important to stay on good terms with them and explain your decision in a way they can support. Depending on your relationship I have a couple of suggestions:\n\n\\-If you feel comfortable be honest about your mental health. \"I'm not in a mental place right now where I feel I'll be able to effectively start my PhD. I'm going to take the next year to work on my mental health so I can be a more effective student\"\n\n\\-If you don't feel comfortable saying that you could blame the pandemic: \"I don't feel comfortable relocating to a new country right now, especially the US, in the midst of a pandemic. I want to wait until next year when things are more stable.\" or  you could say \"I want to take the next year to get a publication, so my application looks more impressive to top programs\"\n\nThe thing these professors want to hear is that if you take another gap year you'll have a plan for it.

But some information that is valid in marketing may not be valid elsewhere. Not all fields of research have the same level of financial support that business schools provide (usually a good stipend, full tuition waiver, less need to keep looking for grants, etc.). Business schools also accept the GMAT for applications, something that other schools don't. And, even for a PhD in marketing, the tips to get accepted can be quite different depending on your specific research interests and from school to school. \n\nSo, I think it's hard to give general recommendations about the financial steps to take. See what programs would be of interest, what level of financial support you can expect, and than you can make better plans.\n\nAbout being accepted, some important factors usually are:\n\n\\- Standardized tests (e.g., GRE) with great scores;\n\n\\- Research experience;\n\n\\- Letters of recommendation;\n\n\\- Fit between you and the program.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jqh4rs/advice_on_phd_programs/gbn5igc/"}, "781": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "laswat220", "Date": 1604864262, "Score": 1, "Body": "Got it!

There\u2019s clinical, social, developmental, cognitive, etc. \n\nYou mentioned having a more or less clinical role right now as a mental health worker. Clinical experience is good but you\u2019ll really want to get research experience. You can do this at the undergraduate level by joining a psychology research lab at your university as an undergraduate research assistant. Ideally, being in a lab for ~2 years or at least 4 semesters would be good. If your school doesn\u2019t have research labs or none are accepting undergraduate research assistants, it\u2019s possible to look at other universities nearby for the same opportunities. A lot of professors have a lab site that lets interested undergrads know how to go about applying for an RA position so that is a good place to start. You may also want to reach out to the professor or lab manager directly. Another option, since you are an army veteran is to seek a research job at your local VA. Especially since you are a veteran, it might be easier for you to get a federal position like this than a non-veteran. \n\nGetting an undergrad research assistant position is only step one. The quality of the research experience you have is very important. You\u2019ll want to seek opportunities to do more than just data entry and seeing research participants. Experiences like writing and presenting posters, doing data analyses beyond descriptive stats, completing a thesis, and writing manuscripts will only increase your chances exponentially. If you\u2019re applying straight out of undergrad, I think professors will be somewhat understanding if you don\u2019t have these experiences but other applicants will so it could hurt your chances. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t able to get undergrad research experience, or you don\u2019t get in to a program after your first time applying, or you don\u2019t feel ready to go to graduate school, look for a paid research assistant position. You\u2019ll usually be expected to hold this position for 1.5 to 2 years but you\u2019ll likely be able to get some really good research experiences - all of what I listed above. Taking time off to pursue more research experience is not looked at unfavorably by professors and a lot of applicants apply after taking time off to do research. \n\nOf course, your grades are important. Do what you can to get mostly A\u2019s in your classes. Be prepared to explain anything lower than a B in your application essay or interviews. If you don\u2019t have a strong GPA (especially for the last 2 years), you may want to consider going into a masters program before a PhD program. This is really only necessary to show you can do well academically in grad school. I would not go into a masters program to get research experience if your GPA is good. \n\nYou\u2019ll also want to build strong relationships with your supervisors and professors. In the future, these will be the people you ask to write you letters of recommendation. The stronger your relationship with these people (ie how well they know you, your academic performance, and/or your aptitude for research) the better your letters will be. These people will also be helpful in the application process because they may be able to help you in your application essay by reviewing and providing feedback. \n\nAs far as deciding where you\u2019ll want to apply - step one is developing a research interest. What do you want to study? This might evolve over time. Once you have an idea of what your research interest is, you\u2019ll want to look at funded PhD programs - specifically the research faculty members and their research interests. Find faculty who supervise PhD students whose research interests align with yours. Make a list. When you\u2019re ready to apply, you\u2019ll want to find out if these professors are accepting students. If so, apply! Also a note about funded programs - don\u2019t apply to programs that are not funded. Funded basically means that they will waive your tuition (so you don\u2019t hav to pay!) and they will usually pay you a monthly stipend. Non-funded programs just aren\u2019t worth the debt in my opinion.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jqh4rs/advice_on_phd_programs/gbn7yp8/"}, "785": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "instructor_throwaway", "Date": 1604865278, "Score": 3, "Body": "I applaud your initiative, but before you go ahead with more volunteer work, I invite you to think about how working for free might end up devaluing research assistant work for yourself and for others in your field.

Seriously. That's a huge undertaking for undergrads and I think a huge predictor of success in grad school. \n\nSecond, application process. It's brutal. Unless you have something already lined up at a specific university, it's going to be a lot of rejection regardless of your app. I applied to about 12 programs and only got 2 offers (only 4 interviews total). Psych PhDs are competitive. Apply to as many programs as you can afford that you would be open to interviewing at. \n\nThird, GRE. In my experience it's mostly a binary thing. You either meet the cut off or you don't. So study and try to hit the cutoff you need, but once you can do that, don't stress anymore. \n\nFourth, grad school in a pandemic. I can definitely see wanting to put off starting until you have the ability to go in person. But tbh I think it'll be a year or two at minimum until we have consistent in person classes again. If you want to take these gap years, that's completely logical. But I would also be worried that a bunch of people will be doing that too so even more people will be applying for the limited spots once things return to normal-ish. It may suck doing the majority of grad school online and I can't even imagine what that would be like to start out with. But it's definitely not a black and white issue.

Now, of course this doesn't apply to everyone, but most people with a good profile. I totally get your dicey situation. Working in a company may not be for everyone. Research is something that doesn't have a defined boundary and the results might be completely different from what you expected in the first place. Development is pretty straightforward, you know the outcome beforehand. This may or may not be true where you're working or will work. If your aim is to get into a job that demands a PhD, like ML or deep learning. I would say go ahead with your PhD. Either way, if your gut tells you a research is necessary for you to hone some skills and probably venture into some uncharted territory with patience, PhD is definitely for you. There are these FAANGM companies which do excellent research, some of their best researchers have great publications and entered the industry with a PhD, but some just got in with a master's (good projects/experience). Get in on LinkedIn and see for yourself, see examples for your area of expertise. I came across a profile who only has a master's degree and is a director at FB for AI.

Everyone has their own unique background, but what you've described is precisely the feeling that almost every PhD student and people applying to PhD programs feel. So just because  you can make a reasonable argument about why you're a \"fraud\" doesn't mean you are one (otherwise, basically everyone would be a fraud). And yeah you could say \"but I'm the actual fraud\", but again, everyone thinks that too. Really, if you haven't read about imposter syndrome, I would highly advise doing that.  \n\n\nA few more comments...  \n1. Your high school performance doesn't matter. Not just in how the admission committees view you, but like for your ability to be a PhD student too. Some people just don't hit a strive until undergrad. Also the stuff you do in undergrad is much more relevant, so it's a better indicator for success.  \n2. If you get admitted somewhere nice, that means you belong there. Admissions committees take into account the quality of the school you come from, and there are so many qualified applicants that they'll only accept you if they really think you're qualified. Many qualified people also don't get accepted for that reason. It's just luck of the draw. Also, if your professors are encouraging you to apply to top schools, then they genuinely think you can do it.  They could be wrong, but they probably know better than you about these things.  \n3. On the \"luck of the draw\" note, DEFINITELY have backup schools. And maybe backup backup schools. Getting into grad school is much harder and more random than undergrad. I've seen many really smart people get totally screwed over. I only got into my 2 backup backup schools, thank god I put them there.  \n\n\nHope that helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jsbiaz/dont_know_if_im_cut_out_for_a_phd_in_cs/gbyfkeu/"}, "1073": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "wilfredthedonkey", "Date": 1605117627, "Score": 2, "Body": "Lol I use Notion for organizing research papers.

Sorry I mostly have bad news; some people definitely get lucky, and being at higher-ranked schools helps a lot. You can look up how fast recent MIT PhDs have become profs vs other good but not as prestigious schools, for example. So it's not guaranteed that you will need to spend that long, but the trend in neuro is towards more students, more postdocs, and more competition for the limited tenure track positions. You'd think they would hire more profs, but I'm not seeing as much of that compared to huge incoming classes of students in some programs!\n\n\nI understand that going for a master's seems better for industry. However, there's a few things you can do to keep both options open and reduce the time you need to take:\n\n- choose a lab where they publish a lot and collaboratively, if you can. Help people and publish with them plus on your own. This will help you build up your CV - my SO has four papers from just his 2-year masters by helping others.\n\n- get started on your dissertation work as early as possible, and only do  classes, TAing, etc if you absolutely need to. Unless you're really passionate about teaching, just focus on the research and finish the degree in fewer years. If you have to do at least one postdoc anyway, no point staying in the PhD for so long. In my area (business/applied psychology), it's very different: there are very few postdocs and most people don't need one, so they stay a little later in the PhD and go straight to faculty positions. It's not fair, but it shows you how different the supply and demand is in other fields.\n\n- look for industry roles where the PhD gives you a benefit- there are more than you'd think. I'm finishing my PhD this year and going into an MBA-level consulting job that pays over 2x that of the same job with a master's. Data scientist roles, industry research roles, and government policy positions all like that you have the PhD among others. The funny thing about my SO's situation is that he's applying to neuro PhDs again for the personal achievements and the professional benefit. He's had trouble finding jobs with growth opportunities and challenges for him, but he'd be starting at the age you'd be finished.\n\nI know it's annoying to hear, but youre starting out very young so there's lots of time to figure this out and benefit from what the PhD can give you.

I think the main differences between us were:\n\n1) a shorter turnaround time -- her work was all experimental, so she could do some tightly constrained experiments and write up and interpret the results to progress the field, where my work was all in silico methods and theory development (which isn't to say she didn't develop novel experimental methods), and really only came fully together at the end\n\n2) a faster ramp up -- she hit the ground running with some narrow projects already laid out, needing mostly to take a few short workshops to learn wet bench techniques, and didn't really have to take any classes; I had to take classes both required and remedial (as I was switching to a new field from undergrad) for two programs (as I joined another when my PI went on sabbatical for all of my second year). My project was largely self-designed and very open-ended\n\n3) intra-lab collaborators -- her lab was a well oiled paper-writing machine with lots of collaboration, so her papers had decent #s of authors that split the work evenly (incl. writing), but I did all the work and writing myself, since nobody in my lab worked on anything similar (and afaik nobody in my lab has ever been a coauthor on anyone else's papers). I did try to kickstart some collaborations and would e.g. do a dozen hours of model development, fitting, comparison, etc. and data visualization for peeps in different departments / labs, incl. hours spent walking them through everything, but none of those ever bore tangible fruit\n\n4) a more motivated PI -- her PI was *very* focused on publishing. In contrast, I wrote my first paper around two years in, but was told to focus on other work rather than submit it anywhere. I wrote my second a year after that, but my co-PI would not let me submit before he made his own revisions... which he still hasn't completed (in the end, he completely ghosted me for almost a year and I had to replace him on my dissertation committee lol). In the time since, a lot of the novelty of those papers has been scooped (and, incidentally, papers have come out \"scooping\" work I never bothered to write up, e.g. as a preliminary study for my QE). Submitting my third and fourth papers was also strongly deemphasized in favor of finishing my dissertation (they also built directly upon that second paper, so we were waiting to have it published before submitting).\n\n5) fewer distractions -- she was funded as an RA and didn't do any teaching or participate in any journal clubs, do any outreach or volunteer work (though she did the latter a fair bit before starting the PhD), or distract herself with side projects or consulting or running workshops. I did a fairly large amount of each.\n\n6) more focus, and different goals -- she's awesome at time management, and had a rigid schedule that she diligently kept to, as well as a timeline charting her course through the PhD. I'm much more prone to distraction, and was happy to goof around pretty much indefinitely, since my super lax PhD experience was a total blast. Her goal was to finish, mine was to have fun and learn lots of new things. We were also long-distance for a bit, and I took some \"time off\" to live with her across the country, during which I was pretty unproductive lol. My own timeline was also linked to hers: not wanting to be long-distance again, I may have faffed around a bit that we could graduate together\n\nAll that said, we ended up in pretty similar places, i.e. next door to one another doing really fantastic \"postdocs\" (hers is a residency, technically, but still requires a bit of research). And I'm hoping to submit some of my dissertation work (which would follow the lab trend of graduating in ~7-8y and only publishing anything at or after the very end). And my postdoc lab is like a turbocharged version of her old lab, and I've cut down on all the extra stuff I did during the PhD to focus on publishing in the hopes of higher productivity (no more journal clubs, outreach organizations, teaching, or anything of the sort, though I'll still serve on the board of directors for a non-profit).

Show you are hardworking and reliable through being active in lectures or in your case take lab work seriously, but also be chatty and friendly. It's very important to get along well with the people.\n\n2. Grades are important, not the ultimate requirement because your research proposal will be the focus on admission for PhD.

I suspect that is because more people agree than disagree that, no, doing a PhD is not much fun.\n\nDoes it have to be fun? Not necessarily. I bet you medical school, residency, studying for the bar, aren't fun either. But I also bet you that medical residents deal with fewer people insisting that their negative experience is due to their attitudes as individuals rather than the systemic issues with doctoral studies as a whole.\n\n&gt;I don't know what relevance Norway is\n\nYou would, if you had read the comment thread that you replied to. \n\nThe person I replied to was telling me that the PhD salaries in Norway are comparable to industry wages.\n\n&gt;Did you do your PhD in the US?\n\nNo. Canada.\n\n&gt;Why did you not enrol in a European program which often have much less requirements at the doctoral level?\n\nThe education commission for my profession only recognizes North American programs, save for one school in South Korea and one in Ireland, which only has a Master's program. Graduates from EU programs are forced to enroll in an expensive (~40-60K USD tuition) post-PhD certificate program to acquire the credentials to progress in North America, typically while they do a post-doc. Or they join industry, but that's typically lower salaries.\n\nThis was also covered in the comment chain you replied to. For someone who accuses me of whining and entitlement, you hardly seemed to have glanced at my complaint before taking offense to it.\n\n&gt;If you knew a. you would likely have a job lined up, and b. that your experience would be terrible, are you saying that you could only have had your position if you went to the particular institution you did? \n\nThat's precisely it. Like everyone else doing a PhD (save, perhaps, for our Polish friend doing his after 10 years in industry) I had absolutely no idea whether I would have a job afterwards, or if I would be one of the unlucky ones. Part of the crushing despair that is doctoral studies is that you spend 4+ years doing it not knowing if it is going to be a waste of some of the best years of your life. \n\nThat is, in fact, the very subject of this thread. OP wrote a post about it up there - I suggest you read it.\n\nThe problems with PhDs are structural, not the particular institution I went to. I liked my institution, I recommend it highly to prospective students I know. I don't know for sure if another institution would have prepared me better or worse. From seeing their graduates, I imagine other institutions would have been better in some respects, and worse in others. I think my output as an individual was more determinant of my success than the peculiarities of my institution, and that may change based on the field. \n\nIn retrospect, it was totally worth it. During? Different story. That's why it was only a good idea **in retrospect**. I've met so many people who regret doing their PhDs, like OP. And you don't know until you've sunk in the effort and the opportunity cost of the better part of your 20's, that you end up in a job that you could have had with a master's or a bachelor's, or even in an entire field altogether.\n\nPeople deserve to know this going in, and no amount of holding hands and singing kumbaya is going to make doctoral studies any different than what they are. \n\n&gt;I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that now that you're in the academy you're working towards bettering it as much as you can however you can, rather than poisoning the well for students you teach by complaining.\n\nI do my part by trying to steer people away from PhDs if they don't need them, and giving them the advice I wish I had received if they decide to go ahead.

But even that isn't certain. I get the potential crisis. I just think probably most people who start a PhD shouldn't. \n\nI appreciate your retrospective appreciation", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jv5tyz/how_was_this_not_a_waste_of_time/gcnf2z0/"}, "1967": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "wheresamanda123", "Date": 1605646907, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yay!

The scholarship here gives you $27,500 per year, covers your course fees, and is valid for three years (you can get a submission scholarship to cover an additional five months, but it is less). \n\nI can't speak to Auckland specifically, but I think things like cost of living are similar between the two cities. I would say that for me the stipend is livable, all though, I have no dependents and live in a flat with 5 people (sharing a room with my partner) which keeps the rent down ($150 per week). Other people in my lab find that rent makes up the largest portion of their outgoings. For example, in your average flat in Wellington, paying around $200 - $250 per week is not uncommon. So if you can find ways to minimize that, it pays off. Food can also be expensive, but there are things like farmers markets which are typically a lot cheaper for vegetables. \n\nThe one thing I would say is that the scholarship alone doesn't give much room for extra curriculars, so if you have friends with full time jobs who always want to do things it can be difficult. \n\nAt Vic, in my department (engineering), it is relatively easy to get a position as a tutor.

I would have a list prepared to argue how/why working under the same advisor could impede your degree and future career. Be direct. Receiving these comments only in your final year was irresponsible on the advisors behalf as your are nearing the end of your degree and should be encouraged and not discouraged. If the advisor has always felt this way, then why is it only brought up now? If they only began to feel this way recently, than why the sudden change? It just doesn\u2019t add up. If they haven\u2019t thought about the repercussions and how this could impact you at the end of your degree, then they are not fit to be an advisor.

However, I think that the moment you become an expert sneaks up on you, and isn't immediately obvious because (at least in my field) the process is so isolated that it is hard to develop an objective sense of how much you know relative to others, especially when your frame of reference tends to bewell-established academics.\n\nFor me, there have been three types of moments that made me think \"hey, I might actually be an expert.\" I'm in the social sciences, so some of these might not be present in STEM.\n\n1). Wikipedia Moments: I was writing a basic historical context section for my dissertation and needed to know a specific date that I had misplaced in my notes. No worries, I say, to Wikipedia! Not only is the date I need not there, but neither is the event I'm writing about. Okay, not a big deal; to Google! Still nothing. I had to go back to primary sources I'd collected to find what I was looking for. I realized then that I knew enough about a topic that I was diving into such intricate details that the Internet had no answers. That really shook me, and this has now happened a few times. Now it mostly just annoys me and made me wish my notes had been clearer the first time around. These moments show that you know more than the general Internet about this topic, which is quite a feat.\n\n2). Mentor Moments: It has helped that my advisor has directly commented on my depth of knowledge (though I have a great advisor and I know many might not share that experience), but more meaningful than that have been the numerous moments when my advisor, an expert, asked me a genuine question about my topic that I could answer and they could not. Related moments include being invited to graduate seminars to discuss work with newer graduate students, and being invited by your mentors to speak at conferences they are organizing. All of these are ways that other recognize your expertise in sometimes small ways, even when you do not yourself.\n\n3). Teaching Moments: Admittedly, these moments are less obvious because generally you teach those who are less of an expert than you are, but just talking about your topic to others can reveal how much you really know that you didn't before. This can apply not only to formal teaching situations, but even just talking to a knowledgeable friend or colleague can reveal surprising depths to your knowledge you never even knew that you had.\n\nSo, my own experiences show that you might very well be an expert without knowing it. We tend to judge ourselves by the work of people who are much more established than we are, and not realize the small ways that we are experts. Even merely understanding the research in a field is a small, non-obvious show of your expertise. Most of the moments I described above started happening after my preliminary/comprehensive exams, as I was working on my dissertation proposal.\n\nThere is no \"magic\" moment where you go from expert to not, but as you work you are slowly accumulating knowledge. At some point, you may realize \"Hey... other people are treating me like I know stuff. What's up with that?\" and then you might talk with a junior colleague wonder \"Hey... do they not know this cool thing I do? Let's help them out and explain!\" Expertise is not a binary category; it is a relative one based on a slow process of accumulation.\n\nP.S. In my experience, while being invited to speak at conferences can make you feel like an expert, sometimes the act of going has the opposite effect as no one is better than making you feel stupid than those two people with a chip on their shoulder in the second row at your talk. They suck, and their opinions should have no bearing on your sense of academic expertise and self-worth.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jx6d1q/so_when_does_this_become_an_expert_in_your_topic/gculpp5/"}, "2304": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Winge1", "Date": 1605808297, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yeah, it may differ in Europe as well I guess, and maybe in different states in the US as well.

Finding a supervisor who understands you and you feel open about communicating to them about your issues\n2. The research group where you feel a belongingness. \nFor example: my current supervisor always consults with the whole group before hiring a new PhD or postdoc and discuss what skills they are bringing to the table and whether everyone feels happy about inviting a new person into the circle. Even though he does the whole application review and interviews himself, the fact that he values and hears the opinion of everyone in the research group is a quality that I look up to.\n- during your first few months in a new group you will feel alienated and possible imposter syndrome. It\u2019s quite common. The only way to get through it is to have a feeling of inclusiveness.\n3. The professor is always open to new research ideas from you instead of just forcing you to do what he chose as the topic. A research topic is not something fixed in a single day. It evolves over time depending on the outcomes. so you need a professor who\u2019s willing to let you grow as your own person with an individual research identity instead of treating you just as a minion\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n4.

My professor is a big shot in his field (he\u2019s actually one from the team that discovered the Higgs Boson at CERN in 2012), but he\u2019s one of the most humblest professors I\u2019ve seen. He\u2019s a great pianist. There are usually group parties every few months where he plays for all of us, have a laugh and be relaxed. His wife was also very close with the research group and they treated everyone of the PhD students as their own child. Another professor in a partner research group takes jaegermeister around with him during get together and pours shots  for all the students and drinks it along with them, laughing and having fun. I also heard from a PhD student who was actually from a different country who fell ill and was hospitalized. Unfortunately his parents couldn\u2019t come to take care and it was the supervising professor and his wife who took care of him at the hospital.\n\nI don\u2019t think that the last part with stories aren\u2019t much use, but I really wanted put this here.

A book I've read during my PhD (\"PhD: an uncommon guide to research, writing, and PhD life\" by James Hayton) helped the meaning behind a PhD really click for me. A lot of people think a PhD is the top of the educational pyramid and for that reason we should be the best at what we do. However, a master's program and a PhD use very different skills compared to high school and undergrad. If instead you look at master and PhD being the bottom tiers of the academic professional pyramid, instead of the top tier of the school pyramid, the true standards by which were judged by our committee align a lot more. Perhaps my PhD has been a sham and I don't deserve the degree I'm working towards, but viewing the program as a starting point, instead of the top tier of academia helped to lessen my stress and bring things into perspective. \n\nAm I an expert in my field? Maybe. But, from my undergrad until now, I've spent 8.5 years learning about my field (final defense is on Dec. 1!!), and I know more than some of my professors in some topics, just like they know more than me about others. I would classify myself as someone who is very knowledgeable within my field, but does that make me an expert? Give me a problem and I will find a solution... Eventually. Does that classify me as an expert? What if I can rattle off 50 different studies and what their findings mean? \n\nFrom a design theory course I took a few semesters ago we had a discussion about how expert and novice were bad adjectives because they have an ill-defined definition. At the end of the day we decided a person was either knowledgeable or not knowledgeable about a topic. \n\nI think a good metric to use is the ability to answer questions about your field. My dissertation is really nothing new. A framework for a simulation program related to UAV systems. It's not rocket science by any stretch of the imagination, BUT you can ask me any question the framework I made, the methods I used for validation, or the program it was written in and I can tell you all about them now.

Most supervisors are pretty understandable people and won't ask you to work outside of 9-5 except for some really extreme times. A few really can't be reasoned with though, and I think their students are the ones we hear the most from because the rest of us don't have so much to complain about. People try to communicate and set boundaries and it fails. They get themselves caught up, having invested too much to leave but with no recourse to change things. Official complaints are systematically ignored.\n\n&gt;Maybe my view is painted by graduate students who procrastinate and are brought to stay up late nights constantly before deadlines instead of inching away at assignments, proposals, and analyses.\n\nI think this is rare. Graduate students, especially PhDs, are probably the top 10% of undergraduates *in terms of neuroticism*. You don't get the grades and research experience necessary for admission by slacking off all throughout undergrad. These are largely people who begin assignments the day they're assigned, and who work solidly to get things done. They have years of solid work ethic behind them. \n\nThe problem is that they're saddled with more work than a human being can get done. There are graduate students who have to mark hundreds of assignments every week, give lectures, help others with their research, contribute to journal clubs, sit on committees, *and* do their own assignments and research. A lot of it is required work if they want to be paid anything at all. Other times, they're strong-armed into it by department heads or PIs. \n\nNo matter how they schedule their time, they have too much on their plate and something has to give. But they're the neurotic undergraduates, so they refuse to sacrifice their students *or* their work. They give up sleep instead. They give up eating lunch. They give up fresh air, sunshine, exercise. They don't have time. They fall more and more ill, becoming less efficient, less able to see clearly. Now they have even less time because they're slow. Now they're burnt out, with zero motivation and dangerously suicidal. It's not a game people play for funsies. People die.\n\n&gt;If you are severely depriving yourself of sleep and feel like it is too much of a sacrifice, maybe academia isn\u2019t right for you.\n\nHow can you possibly justify this? Would you gladly deprive yourself of sleep to an extreme degree? You just said:\n\n&gt;That\u2019s why I said little sleep \u2018at times\u2019. Most of us aren\u2019t expected to be sleep deprived all the time.\n\nYet someone who is being severely sleep deprived by a completely unreasonable PI now isn't cut out for academia? Are they *supposed* to be happy about it? You want them to suck it up and stop complaining? By your own standards, **you** are not cut out for academia since you only accept \"little sleep 'at times'\".\n\n&gt;It doesn\u2019t get easier after grad school\n\nYeah it does, especially for those going into industry. A lot of graduates leave academia because they want to move to a 9-5 job that doesn't demand they work for no pay for 12 hours on the weekend.\n\nEdit: and just to be sure, you should know that I don't fall into this camp. I'm not being asked to work extreme hours. I have a good PI and have no complaints about the way my PhD is going. I'm having the time of my life, 2/3rds of the way through and it's fine. But I don't live under a rock. I see what happens to other people around me who were not so lucky. And it's not because they procrastinated on their marking.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jyl028/something_to_keep_in_mind_obviously_not_op/gda44r1/"}, "2857": {"Subreddit": "u_BrerCaleb_PhD-8724", "Author": "BrerCaleb_PhD-8724", "Date": 1606091011, "Score": 1, "Body": "To my American brothers and Sisters, please, learn something from the Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Belgium, and English brothers, when we faced our decline due to leadership failure.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BrerCaleb_PhD-8724/comments/jz6zw6/trumps_farewell_strikedecline_and_fall_of_the/gda49su/"}, "2858": {"Subreddit": "u_BrerCaleb_PhD-8724", "Author": "BrerCaleb_PhD-8724", "Date": 1606091112, "Score": 1, "Body": "To my American brothers and Sisters, please, learn something from the Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Belgium, and English brothers, when we faced our decline due to leadership failure.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BrerCaleb_PhD-8724/comments/jz6zw6/trumps_farewell_strikedecline_and_fall_of_the/gda4hli/"}, "2859": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "someth1ng_au", "Date": 1606091534, "Score": 3, "Body": "Yeah, our lab had a Lithuanian junior PhD guy that was super toxic \u2013 would never do lab jobs, expected others to schedule things around him, wouldn't clean glassware (when would argue if asked to clean it again), regularly breaks equipment, staining reverse phase columns black (then asking to buy more) etc. His knowledge was on par with a second year undergrad, maybe even a first year.

Most people argue with the downsides of industry to stay in Academia; Which is - IMO - a good argument to not go to industry, but a really bad argument for staying in Academia; The only real reason to stay in Academia is being passionate about your research, because it is otherwise difficult to justify the objectively worse working conditions that Academia offers. \n\nHi there, \n\nSo, I just recently finished my Ph.D. and decided to switch to industry. I have heard over the years many stories of why it is better to stay in Academia vs why it is better to switch to industry. Some people prefer the one, some others prefer the other. \n\nHowever, one argument that always comes first or second in any comparison is that Industry is a bad place. Either the people are less intellectual or more opportunistic (which they probably are in many places), or the spirit in the company is bad or industry is just general a cruel place (because you can get fired or you suddenly are shifted to a different department or something similar). My problem with this explanation is: While this might be a good reason to not switch to industry, this is a very bad reason to stay in academia. If this is the reason a person stays in Academia, it's a direct path to unhappiness. \n\nI could add now my personal industry experience - which is overall a positive one - but I don't think that this would help the discussion. If you decide to stay in Academia, you really need to be driven by the passion to do research. Academia is a risky career. You are with high probability going to significantly earn less, you will be moving around more (some people say that this is a privilege; It is only if you can choose, but in Academia, you often have to), you will work under high uncertainty, given the contracts that are common and the overall risk involved in basic research. You will have a harder time establishing a family because of working hours, income, required geographical flexibility. Finally (though this might be a problem exclusive to European scholars), you are quite dependent on your supervisor, especially during your PhD. If you are unhappy with your boss in industry, you can always switch companies. And bosses know that. But in Academia it's very difficult to switch supervisors (again, at least here where I am from), and even if - it might be detrimental in a field where most people know each other well. Finally, an Academic career is very risky. The pyramid is steep and the really good positions are few. If you don't manage to get to this top, there is a good chance to find yourself mostly grading papers and having little time for research, continuously struggling for funding, having to compromise on research topics, or being somewhere in the middle of nowhere. While not everyone can become a C-level manager (or since many scientists probably don't want that, let's say head of research) in a Forbes 500 company, you don't have to. You can be very well off being a lab head in a company, or leading a small department. And this is easier to accomplish than being full Professor at a top-30 Univeristy. \n\nIn my opinion, these are - on a very simple objective scale - a lot of disadvantages to being in Academia. I see my friends from my Master's studies establishing families, buying houses, getting promotions and having a very balanced lifestyle. I don't say that any of the points made about industry in this threat are wrong. Probably they all are looking on Mondays forward to Friday. But I honestly think that this is a big exception among well educated professionals that work in demanding environments. \n\nAm I unhappy I did a PhD and didn't go straight for industry? No. Because I was for a really long time very passionate about my research, was eager to collect and analyse data, have freedom and time for intellectual growth, and continuously learn something and be autonomous. However, for me, at a certain point, a feeling of saturation with this lifestyle set in. I also felt that the learning curve got less steep. And at that point all those negative points of Academia suddenly starts suddenly to gain weight.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jzcumm/i_used_to_regret_academia_until_i_had_a_taste_of/gdbin0u/"}, "2902": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Accomplished-Ad-7140", "Date": 1606130076, "Score": 4, "Body": "This is what I experienced in my master\u2019s.

Some people should quit, some people shouldn't, any decision is acceptable. \n\nMy opinion is that making a decision based on guilty or on the influence of relatives, girlfriends or anyone like that is not a good approach. \n\nGuilty can easily lead to stupid decisions, and other people can't really know what you're going through and what's best for you. A PhD is also lonely in that regard, even other PhD students may not be able to evaluate your experience, because each one can have a very different experience. \n\nTo me, a better approach is to think about your goals and motivations.

Here are some tips from the top of my head, I have never given these enough thought as to write them down so I might get a bit repetitive... but it's just what worked for me:\n\n* Begin by reducing all your tasks to the bare minimum. From your post it sounds like you are doing a lot. What do you need to do to graduate? In my program I need to write 4 papers and do a couple of short, 1-day courses. The courses were only given a few times a year so that was not a problem, since the dates were preset. At some points I had joined a lot of committees and outreach stuff. While this is a good thing to do (I think part of the PhD experience is also social, not 100% work all the time), keep it low. At one point I was in 3 committees at once and it was way too much. I just kept my favorite. And in my last year I stopped that one, too.\n* Kinda following on the previous point but also reduce your meetings to the minimum. At some point I read an article about Zoom exhaustion, and they said that at the beginning of the pandemic everybody was trying to meet more often than usual because of the lack of in-person contact, but that's not sustainable in the long term and a better option would be meeting half as many times as you normally would. We had weekly group meetings, which turned into 2 weekly Zoom meetings, and still are, but I'm only joining every other  week. I can get away with it more easily now because I'm almost done, but see if there are some meetings that you can cut out.\n* At some point, no matter how hard you try to organize, you will have to juggle more than one project at once. I designated big blocks for projects instead of jumping around every few minutes. Sometimes I would run a code for project A, and it would take about half an hour, so in the meantime I would work on project B. Don't do that. It's exhausting. Designate a day just for project A, and one day just for project B. Or mornings for project A and afternoons for project B.\n* Following the above point, don't try to be too rigid. When I started I made a plan like \"every Monday will be for project A, every Tuesday for project B\" and so on. Turns out, projects have different deadlines and require different things. Some weeks I didn't have to do much for project A but a lot for B or C. So what I started doing is, at the start of the week, take a look at what needs to be done and plan my project blocks accordingly.\n* I only check my email 3 times a day: when my working day starts, after lunch, and when my working day ends. That keeps the stress of having things incoming when I need to focus on something else. Also, I gave myself the rule to reply to every email on the next block. So, if I read an email that needs a reply on my morning email check, I would reply on the after lunch one. This gave me a bit of distance and helped me not rush in my replies.\n* Organizational tools are very personal taste but I used trello and it helped me a lot to break up things into doable tasks. I had one board for every project and my lists in each board were: to do, doing, done, not needed anymore (many times I deleted items and turns out I needed them a few weeks later, so I stopped deleting stuff), random thoughts. The \"to do\" list was divided into the smallest possible tasks -- literally stuff like \"write X code function\". Helps keep you organized and makes you feel accomplished when you move things around.\n* I'm going back to the first point here because it really is the most important one: make note of what you \\*\\*really need\\*\\* to do to graduate. That should be 100% your priority. You mention many things in your post besides \"starting my own research\" -- will you need a certain number of papers to graduate? Then, \"starting my own research\" should be your number 1 priority. Plan and schedule accordingly.\n* And about prioritizing, this is sometimes difficult to do since as PhDs we don't have as much freedom with our schedule as our supervisors seem to have, but: schedule writing/reading/whatever you need to do for you research blocks. Pick one morning, or one day even if possible, were you do not take any meetings. You are not available on Wednesdays mornings anymore. Decline if somebody asks you to meet. And dedicate that time 100% to advance on what you need to get your degree.\n\nSorry for the wall of text but this was really something that I also struggled with.

So another word of advice is: get some rest. Have a time when work is finished. This is even harder to do now if you're working from home, but it's so important. Planning in blocks and using trello helped me with that, because I knew that when the block was over/I was done with X number of tasks in the to do list, it was time to rest. It will get just more and more demanding with time, so try now to build a good routine that allows you to rest properly.

Depends on the degree type and program/school, if it's private school vs. public, as well as the country.  If it's a professional degree like an MBA you have to pay out of pocket.  If it's an academic degree then you may be eligible for funding (e.g. teaching or research assistant) or scholarship. There are MANY scholarships and they always have some type of criteria (e.g. certain program, grades, citizenship), no two are the same.\n\nFor example, the faculty I belong to offers all full-time grad students funding if they're accepted for normal length of completion (2 years masters, 4 years PhD - these #s will be different by program/country/student), most of them however apply for scholarships and/or have a part-time job. But in another faculty/program within the same university, that may not be the case.\n\nEither way, if you are planning to do it abroad guaranteed it will not be free, there will be some costs associated. My advice, first figure out which country (or countries) you're willing to go to, then narrow the down the school/program you're interested in, and then start researching what your options are before contacting any of them.\n\nThe schools Europe are very different than US/Canada - some argue that there is more rigour, as well as more support for student in the US/Canada.

Modern Greek and Hebrew would be cool, but are very unlikely to make up for a deficit in the ancient languages.

So we trade skills. Each of us has a strength to offer another.

I know it sounds dreadful but that's pretty much normal, so worrying is fine obviously, but don't put too much responsability on yourself, in most cases the problem is structural, not personal.\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with your anxiety *per se*, here's a few ideas:\n\n\\- Decide of a specific period of time dedicated to yourself (it can be an hour everyday, or a day every week) and DO NOT YIELD to pressure!! This time is yours, it's there to have fun, to relax, or whatever, but it's yours. The human mind is extremely sensitive to conditioning, and one of the most effective way to condition an emotion/state of mind, is to repeat it everyday at the exact same time. At some point, even under pressure, you'll feel relaxed because to your brain it's \"relax time\".\n\n\\- Exercise! One of the most effective yet disregarded way of dealing with stress. I could explain to you why it works so well based on what we know about stress, and how it was designed by natural selection for a specific purpose, but in the end, all you have to know is that it works!\n\n\\- Try to stay away from pro-inflammatory food (e.g. junk food, candies, high sugar beverage). It feels like comfort food on the moment but it tends to nurture long term stress.\n\n\\- (Re)Learn how to breathe: there numerous breathing techniques that are effective are reducing stress quickly (box breathing is the easiest one I believe).\n\n\\- Try to identify the fundamental cause of your problem and see if you can act on it. In your case, your research is moving too slowly. Why do you think that is? Can you try to come with new ideas to speed up the process? Can you talk with more experienced researchers in your domain that could give you advice?\n\n\\- Finally, and it might seem like an unimportant matter but I believe it's crucial: identify your strengths. There is not ONE way to do research. There are multiple profiles of researchers, and for the exact same result you might not mobilize the same resources as your PhD supervisor for instance, or stay motivated with the same tasks.\n\nHope that helps :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/k3sfcj/how_to_handle_anxiety_and_stress_during_your_phd/ge4z8zn/"}, "3620": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "_Shug", "Date": 1606733586, "Score": 1, "Body": "My PhD is pretty niche, emerging field type thing.

Despite this small failure, I actually enjoyed using Zettelkasten because it changed my focus from \"trying to understand everything 100%\" to \"understand enough to make connections\". Given enough time, you would create your own knowledge network, i.e., your \"long-term memory\".\n\nA side effect of the method was that I was not anxious anymore about remembering everything because whatever I needed I could just look into my Zettelkasten for the answer.\n\nTo answer your question: I still have to find a good way to create the Zettelkasten, Emacs is good but it takes some time to learn.
