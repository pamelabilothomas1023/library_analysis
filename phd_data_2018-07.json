I'm assuming you'd rent a 2 bedroom apartment, which will likely run you about 1100 to 1200 a month. Depending on location, you may be using public transit. Your husband would be paying 50 a month as a student. You will be paying 90 as a non student.\n\nFood can be cheap depending on what you are accustomed to buying but I am cooking for one and find I spend about 100 a week on food, so about 400 a month, and that's without a husband or child to cook for.\n\nIf you want to know what hydro will cost in a specific location, you ca  contact Hydro Quebec with the address and they will give you the specific history of hydro costs for that address. I find in the winter hydro for my 600 sq ft apartment runs about 150 a month (it is billed on 60-day cycles). In the summer it is less but I don't have AC.\n\nInternet bundles will usually run you about 50 to 60 for a decent bandwidth cap (if you're going to use any streaming services like netflix).\n\nAs for working, international students are allowed to work on their student Visa but if I recall it is limited to something like 10 or 20 hours a week if unrelated to their studies. I would confirm that with the government though. I don't know for sure when you would be eligible for a work Visa, but I think you would be at some point in his time there as a student.\n\nThe job market is not favourable atm. But with a degree you will likely have better luck, though I don't know your field so I can't speak to that specifically. If you work any sort of face to face service, French is generally required and English considered an asset. The city offers French lessons to those coming from outside the country. They are either free or heavily discounted so that is worth exploring for sure. You can live and navigate the city very easily without French, but working any sort of job with person interaction is going to be very tricky without French unless it is a specific job that caters to anglophones.\n\nWest side of the city is more anglophone and east side is more francophone. The downtown is where the shift happens.\n\nIf you're going to rent, be sure to visit the place and really look into it.

It's all about your PI (the professor advising your research).  You read lots of research papers and figure out what subtopic your want to research, you get a conversation going with several potential PIs who work on that topic, if you both feel like it's a good fit then you prepare a formal application paperwork package and the PI (almost) rubberstamps it through, you spend 6 years doing research and publishing under the PI, you finish and as you are networking and job hunting, if folks want to know about your background, they'll ask you what projects you've worked on, and who your PI was.

I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.\n\n&gt; An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.\n\n&gt; My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.\n\n&gt; I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\n\n&gt; I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.\n\n&gt; Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.\n\n&gt; I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\n&gt; I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\n&gt; I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\n&gt; I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\n&gt; I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.\n\n&gt; I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.\n\n&gt; The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.\n\n&gt; I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.\n\n&gt; That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).\n\n&gt; I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\n\n&gt; And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.\n\n&gt; All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

I did a group project last term and one of my more visually-minded peers used the slide templates to completely transform them. No change to the text, just the visual presentation.\n\n- As a general rule, try not to dwell on any single slide too long or you'll lose your audience. So keep it to one idea per slide. But don't blaze through them, just the same. If you don't plan on saying much about a particular topic (i.e. 10-20 seconds) condense it into another slide or eliminate that slide altogether.

This is also a good place to include hypotheses based on your knowledge of the background literature.\n\n3) Methods - here you can get into more gritty details. How will you approach the problem? Why are the methods you're using significant? Why are you using these methods as opposed to others?\n\n4) Predictions - what do you expect to see, and why do you expect to see them? Here you're also getting more detailed because you provided the audience with necessary background information.\n\n5) Expected outcome and impact - now that you have stated the broad introduction, background, methods, and some potential results, what is the outcome and impact your research will have?

At PhD you are going to be working on active researcher and if you can\u2019t be bothered, difficult etc they will just not take you. This means conveying the right attitude, being easy to work with, someone they can chat with is all good. It\u2019s a lot more like a job interview than a degree application.\n2. You need to show writing and design skills. You are going to be training to be a researcher in your field, a real one and when I say real one you will not really understand the difference between an undergrad research project and a PhD project until you get there. Part of this is that you can contribute ideas and help problem solve or even pitch new ideas. Find evidence to show this. They really do not expect you to be perfect but just not incompetent.\n3. Interest in the field is a must. This sounds really dumb but you would be amazed how many people do a PhD because they can\u2019t find a job, struggling with their life postgrad or think it is an easy wage for three years if funded. These people can get through but they want you to be interested because it is nice to work with people who want to be there and also it helps when you are struggling if you love your subject.\n4. Consider that you may not be trained enough yet. PhDs can be out the gate and straight into the lab or doing field work. If you don\u2019t know how to do these things yet consider if you need to do a masters. I had to after my degree and it meant that the time I had for my PhD did not involve basic training for the equipment but instead day one I could be in the lab and be useful. This was definitely the deciding factor on if I got a PhD or not. Not everyone needs one to get onto a PhD but it can be a big problem.\n5. Really consider who you take. When you are picking places and going for interviews remember you are choosing them as much as they are choosing you. Interview them a little, find out if they are suitable, can you crack a joke, do they have clear plans for training or does it sound vague and scripted? If you are not confident that the person you will have as your supervisor can support you (professionally and even emotionally) and will be a good grounding point to train you then don\u2019t do it. There will be someone else, go find them or your chances of dropping out go up hugely.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBtw I\u2019m from the uk so there are differences in how PhDs work here vs other countries but tried to minimise talking about them", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/908lnq/applying_for_phd_positions/e2orh0l/"}, "502": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "McBindle", "Date": 1532034850, "Score": 3, "Body": "I collect emotional quotes from scientific publications.

I am sure all of us will feel this way when we reach this stage. \n\nA couple of things which can actually help you get through this. \n\n1) Try isolating your work time and your fun/break time. Stick to it. You can start this off slowly. For instance, start by working for an hour and plan the rest of your day to do other things. The key idea is to plan. Plan both your working hours and the time when you take a break.  Once you start meeting small goals, you can increase the number of hours.  This will help you to start getting into the groove of working. I would highly recommend planning this with someone else. By this way, you can get constant encouragement for completing tasks. \n\n1 a) Avoid distractions like Netflix during your allocated work time. For me, Netflix has been a go-to drug when I have to be working and I do not feel like working -- which is bad. Taking a small break, and attempting to work again is way better.\n\n2) It's important that you enjoy your break time. List out all the things which you like doing. Overall, taking a good break with supportive friends or even spending time with yourself can help you feel positive. \n\n3) I am so glad that you have supportive advisors who value your work. This is encouraging because you are doing something useful.  Take a step back, and understand that you have almost achieved what you started. All of us come into this program hoping to have contributed something at the end of it and learned the art of science. I am glad that you are almost there. \n\n4) A couple of months ago, I was struggling to get anything done. I was stuck on a project for way too long after many rejections. I was avoiding resubmissions of my paper and could not get my self to make small changes to my paper. This is when my advisor told me that this is not the only thing which I am going to be doing in my life. Note that she did not intend to question my lack of capabilities for not completing things. But hinting at me that, this is not everything. \n\nI hope this is useful.

Sorry if this is a bit of a hijack. I've felt like throwing in the towel at times during my first year (particularly at the end of this summer). I spent a massive amount of money moving cross-country, intending to study A but ending up with a project B which bore no fruit, so now I am working on C with my advisor piggybacking on his ongoing project. It's applicable to my general area of interest but I can't say it is what I imagined when I began last year.\n\nWhile the project is important I am not particularly passionate or interested in this sliver of the field, and I've felt like I am spinning my wheels. I'm not quite sure what a job looks like once I've graduated, and I don't know that I have accumulated \"research skills,\" either - at least not in the sense of my other cohort, who are preparing abstracts, running experiments, and learning wet lab techniques which elude me.\n\nI can't share your experience with your advisor, although my advisor is very hands-off in that he will not prescribe me a path to follow. His teaching style is very self-guided, and so I have a wide berth although I can reach out for help. This is both a curse and a blessing. I don't need to be in the office 8-5, but I'm not sure if I'm going down rabbit holes that will end in dead ends, either. There is not a lot of structure.\n\nLike you, I haven't made any friends (my definition is someone I could call up randomly and end up hanging out with) although I have a circle of acquaintances. Part of the reason is I'm considerably older than most of my cohort (anywhere from 5-15 years older) and the other half is that I have a very anxious personality and tend to keep to myself. This isolation has really weighed on me and I have spent the last month having the most difficulty motivating myself to get work done.\n\n**OP, here's my \"advice.\" You clearly recognize that your current state (the drinking and smoking one) does not put you on a good trajectory. The \"blanket of lethargy\" sounds like classic depression, which is more common than you think. So is the all-or-nothing thinking (e.g. that you have not accumulated any research skills, or that your parents will be \"disappointed\" in you). Either way, you need your mental state to improve. Now what brings on that improvement, whether it's the experiment changing, picking up a new hobby, seeing your advisor more often, or dropping out, I don't know what is best for you.**\n\n**I don't think you need to drop out just yet, because there's a lot you can do within the constraints of a program. But surely you need things to change or you to get some pep in your step. Getting more face time with your advisor is a good first thing to try. You may not even be operating on the same wavelength. He may think that e-mail contact is sufficient for you/him, when you clearly feel it is not adequate. I've had the experience of miscommunications with my advisor and other supervisors in the past. Sometimes putting all your cards on the table is all it takes to clear the air.

When you\u2019re working with people, a lot of your results aren\u2019t gonna go the way you thought it would because people are unpredictable. This means that not only could I be repeating research that has already been done, but never written up because the results were insignificant, but also that a lot of research being done is stuff that\u2019s more of an easy publish, rather than the work that needs to be done. Ie \u201cwe showed that the results of x et als work are still relevant in a population of 31-32 year olds, as well as just 29-30 year olds\u201d or some other bullshit (this is a bit of an extreme example to illustrate my point, but you get what I mean). A lot of the research isn\u2019t applicable to everyday life for this reason and nobody cares. The research that would be applicable to everyday life is messier and therefore doesn\u2019t have guaranteed publications cause it might not have guaranteed significant results, so less people are willing to do it because everything in academia revolves around being published. \n\nIt also lends to the ethically questionable process of changing your hypotheses once you have your data until you have something significant. Id love to say this doesn\u2019t happen in academia but at least in my university, this happens all the time. I find this practice to go completely against what scientific enquiry stands for (and social sciences are really concerned with being taken seriously as a science!) yet I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say my supervisors had pushed towards this when my original hypotheses for some research was disproved. Turns out to excel in academia, you have to be willing to bend your morals all in order to publish. \n\nTo me, insignificant results are significant in themselves and we should be talking about them more! Why something wasn\u2019t significant when we expected it to be is interesting! It\u2019s one thing to say \u201cso we didn\u2019t find what we were expecting to find, but we did also find this which is quite interesting\u201d compared to \u201cthis thing that we never even thought about before setting up the research is EXACTLY what we predicted we would find and look our data supports that.

Nope never heard of it ever nope\u201d.\n\nFinally, to me the onus on publishing in journals as a way of disseminating information is extremely exclusionary, which kind of shows we are publishing for the sake of it because that\u2019s what\u2019s valued in academia, rather than finding things out because we want to expand knowledge and share that with the world. We have to write in obscure, complicated language, using 12 words where 1 would do, making it impossible to read but hey who cares cause it sounds smart! Most published articles are hidden behind an obscene paywall (\u00a340 upwards to rent an article FOR A DAY), meaning the only people who get to find out about our research are either people who are members of institutions such as universities, or extremely wealthy people.
