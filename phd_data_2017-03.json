After my creative writing masters I joined the Navy as a Warfare Officer. During my service I had trouble remembering bearings to create fixes on the radar. A fix is three or four relative bearings from the ship to determine location. So, for example you would find bearings of 128, 157 and 194, and quickly input them them into the radar to create the location fix. On an average day (8 hour shift) a watch officer would do anywhere from 40 to 120 fixes on the coast and 120-240 fixes on a pilotage (coming into harbour). It was a huge part of the job and I wasn't good at it, so I started researching ways to improve memory. I found about about n-back (continuous performance task n steps back - like a delayed simon says) and started training for half an hour a day for a year. The results were miraculous and I found that my not only my memory, but my cognitive abilities had been greatly improved. \n\nAfter I left the Navy, I started researching psychometrics because I was looking for employment in the Intelligence sector, while doing entrepreneurial activities. At a networking event I met a organisational psychologist who was using cognitive neuroscience and psychometrics to improve the cognitive abilities of professionals in various areas. We got talking and he mentioned that the greatest weakness of n-back as a training tool was that people wouldn't keep working at it because it was boring. Using my game development background we collaborated on a project to make a fun version of n-back, without losing the effectiveness of the training system (watering it down). From there I started researching working memory, focusing specifically on n-back to create a game people would enjoy, but still get all the benefits of n-back from.\n\nI made a prototype, but it didn't achieve what we set out to do. I'm currently testing a new prototype, but finding a job or progressing my academic career has become a priority right now.\n\nCommunications design has a great deal to do with user interface design, intuitive controls and psychologically rewarding interaction.

If you are considering joining, all I can say is, what you get out of the CSA is what you put in. It is not a magical organization where you join and get automatically hired into industry. Much of the information you get from it can be found publicly. Some of the things like networking scripts and member interview question databases are unique within the association. Most importantly, joining the CSA gives you access to a large network of professionals that's a bit more close knit than your average alumni network (again, how much you get out of either is how much reach-out efforts you put in).\n\nWhat CSA did most for me is to get me to take action, and actively develop my network, which was ultimately how I got my current job. The interviewing question database was pretty much on point to my actual interview, which helped a lot as well. What Isaiah (the founder of CSA) is trying to do is to invest time to develop a large community of PhDs who have transitioned into industry. As more CSA members transition and move up the career ladder, the CSA becomes better positioned to give even more value to new members. There are several dozens of examples in the past year where CSA members have helped each other get jobs.\n\nMy financial rationale for joining is investing $500-1000 on a program that can help you find a job even 1 month earlier than you would have is a negligible investment for a large payoff. I anticipate that as CSA grows and gains more credibility, the price to join could increase.\n\nIn the end, joining is up to you. If you are committed to taking action (meaning more than just reading articles online), going to networking events, strategizing your job search, then there's no need to join, you'll be fine with just the information you can find on blogs and linkedin.

Before joining CSA I had given 2 on-site interviews with no clue as to what went wrong at the final stage which led to no job offer. 6 months with CSA and I can already feel that my mindset has completely changed from a post doctoral trainee to a professional seeking a job in real world. I just recently had an opportunity for another on-site interview and the difference was that this time I was the one asking a  lot of science and business related questions.

It is more due to learning about and learning from experiences of other PhDs and Post Docs who went through the same situation. CSA is not just about helping secure a job. Its a group that helps you change your perspective towards science. Its a group that makes PhDs and Post-docs realize that you are not just researchers and that science is not only about securing a grant or an assistant professor position. It\u2019s a training that would have been extremely helpful for me had I got it in my university when I was a graduate student. In addition, have you all not heard about your professors talking about the importance of networking and collaborating?  This is a group that helps you do that in the most easiest way .

When I stumbled on cheeky scientist I was at a point in my job hunt where I have already paid for two other services that promised to help me find a job. Both were not very helpful, and most stuff they did I could have done or done better. I was very skeptical at this point in my life about services and organizations that advertise helping you find a job/dream job. I didn't trust any success stories from the cheeky scientist web page because I did not trust job hunting helping organizations at this point in my life and money was very tight. When I saw very little information about cheeky science other than just on cheeky science web page I was even more skeptical. I have to second the \u201cscammy\u201d vibes other people are writing. As an outsider, I got that feeling as well and it made me not purchase the membership right away. Finally, I did find some advice, I believe it was from this Reddit thread, that helped me finally go through and purchase the membership. \n\nIn short, Cheeky Scientist is worth the investment. I am now in industry and I still go back to some of the webinars and people I know through the organization to help other fellow cheeky scientists and also advance myself in my career path. It is nice that it is a lifetime membership.\n\nI believe Cheeky Scientist would have been a better investment if I purchased it earlier in my Ph.D. and slowly built up my network versus obviously being in crises mode. I also see the network I built within Cheeky Scientist will be invaluable down the road. Who knows what all of us will be doing in 5, 10, 20 years \ud83d\ude03. \n\nI have a Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry and Post doc experience. In my Ph.D. and Post-doc, I worked on collaborative research projects with semiconductor industry companies such as Intel, L3, Freescale, and Texas Instruments. Even with this experience working on projects with industry collaborators I did not find a job right away when I graduated, and even months into a post-doc. Here is a link to my Linkedin if want to learn more about my Ph.D. experience and research. - https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-ross-89623566/\n\nCheeky scientist is another tool in your tool box to help get your foot in the door. Some of us just need that little extra knowledge and connections (network) get that fail to turn into a pass. In industry, there is no A, B, C, F system, it is pass or fail. You either got the interview or you didn\u2019t. You either got the position or you didn\u2019t. There are some key phrases, key suggestions, key people to talk to and network with that helped me. Most of this helpful information came from webinars cheeky scientist has on their web page. I would listen to them while I was job hunting and working on responsibilities as a post-doc. \n\nNow cheeky scientist alone will not get you a job, and a lot of the information they give is just common sense to me. Someone who is applying for a job in another country that where they were born in or is not strong in their social skills cheeky scientist will be very helpful. I have to admit, being a people person and staying in the United States all my life I still found some \u201cgolden\u201d information while sifting through the \u201cdirt\u201d. I still learned several good sayings, tactics, and communication skills that made getting an interview and doing better in an interview. For example, what do you say when an interviewer asks you, \u201chow are you today?\u201d and when they ask you,\u201d what is the base salary you are looking for?\u201d In short, you have to work on yourself and be willing to fail\u2026 a lot. Then learn from your failure and continue.\n\nIf you have seen a group of crabs in a bucket, you will notice that they are all trying to get out and will pull other crabs down to get closer to the edge of the bucket. What if all the crabs help each other? That is how if view cheeky scientist. I would see a job position or knew of a job opening due to a friend and would post it on cheeky scientist if I knew I would not be a good fit, and then offer to give my friends email/LinkedIn info for them to make a connection if someone in cheeky scientist was interested. Having inside knowledge and knowing the hiring manager is key. I knew someone would do the same for me. We are all educated professionals. If we all work together we can help each other reach our goals. I truly believe the best way to get what you want is to help enough other people get what they want.\n\nIt took me 2 months, but I found a position. I networked from 10am-4pm Monday-Friday and applied to jobs the rest of the day. usually working 8\u201312 hours Mon-Friday and 4\u20138 hours Saturday and Sunday. I would cold call, email, and reach out to friends and people I have never talked to in my life. Some, how I still made advances in my post-doc work. Yay, delegating work to younger graduate students: P\n\nI recommend getting into industry ASAP! I took a contract position that had a minimum 2 weeks to a maximum 6-month contract as analytical chemist analyzing products in development at and suitability tests for up to 3 years in shelf life. This position paid less per hour than my post doc, but it was full time so I did get paid more per week. More importantly, I got industry experience and continued to look for a position I really want. I am proud to announce that I will start as a Senior Packaging R&amp;D Engineer at Intel in February 2017. I joined Cheeky scientist in August 2016, got a contract job in October 2016, and got the job offer for Senior Packaging R&amp;D Engineer December 2016. I got my dream job at my dream company.\n\nMy manager in my contract position showed me how he/she looks at resumes for Ph.D. positions for his/her\u2019s research team. In industry, when they are hiring for a position that would need a Ph.D. for, they look for industry experience (in a related field to what they are hiring for), experience with instruments and software that they currently use in the group that they are hiring for, and a Ph.D. in a related field. Now if you have all 3 your will be in the yes category. If your still in academia you most likely don\u2019t have industry experience so you must have the last two conditions just to be put in the maybe category. Now I know why it was so hard to transition. Most companies do not want to gamble with someone who hasn't proved themselves in the industry setting. You have to really stand out for them to want to hire you.\n\nI recommend that in the last 2 or 3 years in your Ph.D. you meet with the career services department of your University. At my University, there was not much in terms of help at the Ph.D. level. The people at the Career services only dealt with BA, BS level students. But I made an appointment every 3 weeks, asking for suggestions, tell them what I have done and what I plan to do next. If you have a full 2r or 3 years, then you can make an appointment every month or two. Go to every career fair! Every \u2026 single\u2026 one\u2026. Seriously! I made great connections for a career fair that was only for business majors for example! I stood out from the crowd! Booths of companies that would normally be hour long lines in engineering/scientist focus career fairs had no lines at the business career fair. At career fairs, I got a lot of offers for an internship in 9 months (the following summer), that would have been perfect if I will still working on my Ph.D. Seriously guys and gals, I have seen so many graduate students get an internship and they get a job offer the same year they finish their internship. I had two coworkers get an internship, get an offer (no interview, their internship was their interview) within the same year. Both coworkers go an offer before they graduated. One was pushed through the program, the other just left and finished writing his dissertation then came back to defend then went back to work \ud83d\ude1d. Would you want a job before you graduate? Get an internship.\n\nIn the last 2 or 3 of years your Ph.D. I would focus on finding a job not finishing your Ph.D. Finding a job is so much harder. Once you have a job lined up usually your adviser and committee members will help push you through. If you\u2019re having difficulty, consider investing in cheeky scientist.

For the record, I did not go to grad school with the intent on becoming a professor, but I was open to the idea at first. Now, I want to get as far away from academia as possible. It is a corrupt and broken system. The main issues are: 1. Too much emphasis on publication count/impact factor, little to no emphasis on being good advisor/mentor/teacher or doing work for the public good. 2. Lack of oversight and entirely too much trust that members will adhere to ethics and integrity. 3. Exploits cheap, highly skilled labor (i.e adjuncts, post-docs, etc.) 4. Too self-centered in the sense that academia seems only good at preparing people for jobs in academia, which there are very few of. \n\nScience suffers as a result of this. PIs choose to investigate less interesting questions because they know they can publish the results quickly and easily. Because there are so many perverse incentives and pretty much no one checking your work, irreproducible findings are a big issue. Some studies on the matter claim that 75+% of papers published in certain fields are irreproducible. Academia isn't the sole cause of these issues, funding is also. Projects that have a clear return in a reasonable amount of time tend to get funding which means projects that might be worthwhile researching but may take many years or don't have a clear return don't get funded. Also, no one gets funding to reproduce other people's work. \n\nI've experienced all of this and more first hand in grad school, including watching another student in my department get outed for publishing fabricated data.

The support I found there is amazing and continuous.\n\nYou pay one fee and you have a life time access to all the organized material, these are the ones that I found more valuable: 1) detailed descriptions of career options and a mean to help you take a decision of which may be the good one for you; 2) how to effectively grow your network, how to use it to your advantage and how to do it with the right mindset. Whenever someone needs help with following up with an interview/cover letter/resume/networking/interview questions, there are always other associates who will step forward for support in addition to the materials available.\n\nJust being a part of the CSA won\u2019t secure you a job by itself, you must work on it and put in an effort to reach your goal, as everything in life!
