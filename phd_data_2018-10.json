It sounds like your aim is to learn and remember information for an exam? (Although you don't mention your aim in your post).\n\nI think your method is probably quite inefficient for studying large amounts of information from textbooks. Copying or rewriting passages is probably not the best way to learn for recall. I assume you also have lecture content to revise from - use this to guide your study. \n\nIf I had to learn information for an exam from a textbook, I would personally approach it like this:\n- After deciding the textbook is useful to you, look at the contents of the textbook and pick out chapters which are relevant to your research area. Then narrow these chapters down to chapters which contain topics which are new to you or that you struggle to understand. Focus on these chapters.\n\n- Flick through the chapter and identify key sections and sections which are new to you. Read through each sub-section (maybe 5-10mins of reading) and then make some brief bullet points on the key points or completely new information that you think you'll easily forget. It's essential not to write too much in your notes - don't use full sentences, use abbreviations etc. You could also include the page reference to help you find it again if it's a particularly passage/diagram. \n \n- At the end of the section or chapter write in your own words a short summary of the key points. \n\n- Where possible, try and summarise information into diagrams. They don't have to be amazing, but a quick sketch of a graph or diagram of signalling pathway for example. If you use the computer, sketch these and then snap a photo on your phone and paste it to your document. \n\n- Save your notes in a logical format so they are easily accessible again when you want to re-remember the content. When you are at the stage of committing the notes to memory, I find it best to read through a sub topic and then try and note down all the information I remember 10 minutes later (eg. By making a quick mind map or drawing an annotated diagram from memory). If you remembered something accurately, that's great, you've probably learnt it. Focus on the information you mess up. Repeat until you can reproduce all the vital information or diagrams from your notes from memory. \n\nThat all being said, I don't think textbooks are often the best way to learn. I mainly used them in undergraduate to see alternative explanations of concepts or for the diagrams (some biology textbooks have amazing detailed diagrams which really explain the topic). I would have thought that at PhD most people should be looking to mainly read papers. And then if there is a topic or term you are unfamiliar with, read a review paper. If it's a method or a word you don't understand, quickly Google it. I'd only resort to textbooks if I was a complete beginner in a topic and I needed an in depth understanding of it. \n\nHope that helped a bit!

I've gone through the literature and instead of trying to comprehenvisely synthesize all of it (narrative analysis, film critiques, critical race theory, statistics, etc.), I grouped it into categories, and then expounded on why my research would be adding to the overall knowledge. \n2. **One-off sentences**: I used these as justification for why my dissertation was a necessary addition. People are interested in it, but noone else has done it. \n3. **No Info On Topic But Methods I Use**: For those things written already that use the same methodology but a different topic, I explained how using their concepts would be able to get me from A-B. For example, I explain that even though the topic is dissimilar, the way in which my topic can be studied mirrors how other people have successfully studied their own topics. \n4. **Philosophical Reasons I Think My Idea Is Legit**: This touches a bit on the justification, but builds on the theoretical framework parts of a humanities/social science dissertation. Not knowing your field, YMMV with this one. \n5. **Delimitations**: For all the things that people might suggest I do, I wrote down explicitly why I am not doing them, and justified it by looping back to the items I mentioned in #1-4.

Long story short, 5 months from handing in thesis I decided to take full-time job. Big reasons were: I somewhat started PhD cos I ran out of money and got scholarship and I was doing it for job prospects anyway, and because I was pretty close to completion I negotiated with my work to give me 1 day/week to finish my PhD. My managers already have PhD but the work environment is slightly researchy that pretty much everyone else is working on their PhD part-time, although not necessary for the job. I don't imagine having PhD as requirement for managerial roles either. I was a special case to be given 1 day/week because I came from a slightly different background that had very little application to day to day duties whereas the rest were doing projects as an extension of work-related research. It is definitely is a challenge, since it's harder to meet with my supervisor, getting lazy after work to work on PhD etc. But I've set a strict deadline, and luckily I'm pretty good with time management so I use 1 week day and one of the weekends to work on it. I guess  it helps that I'm towards the end but still producing data. I think it's important to not lose the sight of it if you decide to go part-time, people take ages to finish their PhD if you're working and have life too.

Here are my suggestions:\n\n1. If you are applying to top universities, \"S/He is very good\" is not going to cut it. Make sure that they mention that you are the best (or one of the best) students they worked with.\n2. If you have had \\*any\\* teaching experience, ask your referees to mention it. Mentoring experience also counts a lot.\n3. Apply to a lot of places. Spending a few hundred dollars on applications is totally worth it. I applied to 13 and got selected in 5. It was a very happy experience to choose the one you really like. Remember, you most certainly would spend half a decade in that place. Having more choices is always good.\n4. Sorry for not answering your question so far. I would suggest asking all three of them for references. I would then utilize the following combinations:\n\n* Top choice universities: Masters boss + undergrad boss + current supervisor\n* Second choice universities: Masters boss + current supervisor + former supervisor\n* Last choice universities (ones you apply just to be safe ;) ): undergrad boss + current director + former supervisor\n\nGenerally, recommendation letters are mostly to make sure that you are what you claim to be in your CV. Grad schools very well know that you need the right temperament more than knowledge/skills. Letters from people whom you have directly reported to (Masters boss / job supervisors) would attest to your temperament, enthusiasm and efforts. This is why I value the letters from your direct supervisors much more than the ones whom you don't report to directly (director / undergrad boss).\n\nLastly, apply as early as you can. Some universities start scrutinizing applications before the deadline (at least mine does) if the package is complete or near-complete. You have a much bigger advantage applying early than a few days before the deadline. It also gives your referees ample time to work on your letters.\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9lphp6/letters_of_recommendation_who_to_choose/e78pah7/"}, "154": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "psychendurance", "Date": 1538777710, "Score": 3, "Body": "What are your interests?

I helped a couple of people out by proof reading their papers, and that turned into a useful editing side business during my candidature. I don't make enough to pay all my bills, but it is a very nice supplement to my income. Plus, \"international communication\" is a great skill to have!\n\nSo I think that if you do decide to do the PhD, you can gain skills that help you in other places, too. I wouldn't personally recommended it if you aren't absolutely certain, because mine led to an unfortunate year of depression, but I do think it is useful beyond working in academia.

I researched made very clear how many years of funding were offered to admits (even if they didn't give explicit #s re: $/year)\n\nMy guess is at least in political science you'd be talking much lower tier to see no funding. The question instead is:\n\n* is the funding being offered **enough** (given CoL in that area)\n\n* what expectations accompany that funding?\n\nThe former is usually universally \"good enough,\" especially with the proliferation of graduate student unions. Most either pay grad students enough or are getting there slowly but surely. \n\nThe latter is where you'll see lots of variation, both in type of admit and school type. Big state schools? Prepare to teach your own class of 50+ (if not closer to 100) UGs from semester one or two. Small liberal arts uni? You'll never teach, but you will TA. You get the picture. \n\nAs for type of admit, most funding packages will make very clear what is entailed. For instance, some programs differentiate between instructor/TAships and Fellowships. Which means you teach/TA and that is the bargain: the uni gets your teaching labor and you get paid to be a student. If you get a fellowship, you don't have to do anything.\n\nI think the fellowship model is dying out, but I'm not really in the know. \n\nSorry for the text wall. \n\n**Tl;dr**: most schools will explain their funding policy on the Web page (graduate programs&gt;Phd handbook or FAQ), and if not it will definitely be clear in any offer of admission whether it's funded or not (but again in political science I at least didn't see any places that didn't offer funding for Phd students). \n\nGood luck!

Your GPAs are pretty good. I am making an assumption that you are an international student, possibly from India (considering the 10-point scale, and your description of undergraduate and postgraduate education as UG/PG). Top universities usually have a conversion metric for different foreign universities into the US 4.0 point scale. For instance, my GPA in India was 8.01/10.00, but after conversion, it came up as 3.81/4.00. Taking into account all this, your GPAs are pretty good.\n2. Your undergraduate education at an unknown university is not going to work against you. I routinely see high-performing and motivated students from relatively lesser known schools being admitted into my (top-10) school. Make sure you get a letter of recommendation from someone who knows you very well from your undergraduate school.\n3. Do not fret about your GRE scores. What happens during the admissions process is this: Usually a low-profile person (say, administrative assistant) sorts the applications based on GRE and TOEFL (for international students) scores. The cutoffs are usually about 160 for Quants and 150 for verbal reasoning. For TOEFL (assuming you are an international student), the cutoff is 100 (with a minimum speaking score of 23). If your scores are below this, the application gets tossed out\\*. This cutoff varies based on school and the program you apply to. The ones that satisfy the cutoffs get forwarded to the admissions committee. They select the applications based on GPAs, recommendations, Statement of purpose, etc. At this point, your GRE scores are more or less irrelevant.  \n\\* - In many cases, even the applications that are tossed out are given a second look by the admissions committee to see if there are any other factors that would make the application worthy to be considered, such as high number of research papers, etc.  \nAlso wanted to add: I would have suggested you retake the GRE again, considering there is still time for applications to start, but your scores are pretty decent. What is your analytical writing score BTW? This is very important and often neglected by students, but not by admissions committees.\n4. You need a very strong letter of application if you are applying to a competitive program. \"This is a good student\" is going going to cut it. [Read this earlier comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9lphp6/letters_of_recommendation_who_to_choose/e78pah7) for a better idea. I would strongly suggest reaching to people who could give you excellent recommendations, even if they are less-reputed.\n5. Your research and lack of publications: Most people who get into PhD programs do not have a prior publication. On the other hand, having one shows that you are interested in research, and that you know what it takes to publish in a peer-reviewed journal. You have some research experience in your Master's program: Make sure you take the recommendation from your research adviser and ask her/him to mention your research responsibilities at length. Find conferences near your area, and send an abstract for a poster presentation. You can put the list of poster presentations in your CV and that could, to some extent, help with the 'lack of publications' scenario.\n6. Lastly, you don't need an extraordinary idea/story to write in your statement of purpose. Just answer the question 'Why would you like to do a Ph. D. at &lt;this university&gt;?'. Elaborate in detail. That's all. You will find examples online.\n\nYou are not being paranoid. It is good to ask yourself these questions before applying.

If you are a researcher of note, the professor will be inclined to let you finish, because it will reflect well on the professor.\n\nThe goal is if you can agree for the professor to grant you a single in-person meeting, you walk up to the professor and slap a stack of papers on their desk (finished thesis, documentation, etc), which makes it pretty tempting to accept you back.

There are a lot of red flags here that a faculty member would ignore. \n\n1. Poor grammar and spelling. \"Advisior\". \"Yo\" instead of \"to\". If your first impression shows that you haven't taken 30 seconds to read over an email, that indicates to the recipient that you haven't put much time into this email and probably don't care much about the outcome. Whether that's true or not, always check over your grammar and spelling.\n\n2. Generic text. This email could be mass emailed to any faculty even slightly related to environmental engineering. There's nothing in this email to show that you did the research to see what part of their work is interesting to YOU and why you would be a valuable addition to the lab group. Sure you could insert a few words about the topic of their research but where do you go into detail? An example of a past email where you elaborated would be helpful. This sounds like you're copy pasting an email template and sending it to 100 people in a day, changing maybe 10 words for the University name, faculty name, and faculty research topic. In other words, you have not demonstrated serious interest in the research they do because you don't mention anything about YOUR potential contribution to THEIR work. This is key if you want to start a conversation. My advisor gets hundreds of emails that look just like this from international graduate students desperately trying to get into grad school. He ignores them completely because there's no way to answer them all and most likely they have 20 other universities on their list to spam.\n\n3. Casual language. Don't put slang like \"env engg\" in a formal email to a professor. Maybe it's common where you're from, but that's not standard for professional writing in the USA. You should spell out \"environmental engineering\" and capitalize properly the name of the University, write \"Dear Professor _____\" (capital P here), etc. This is another tell of a careless email because punctuation is too casual or incorrect. There are plenty of examples of proper grammar and punctuation for a cover letter or formal email. You can Google it and spend 5 minutes making sure it is all proper.\n\n4. Bluntness. There's a joke that Germans speak perfect English but remove the vagueness that is considered polite in American English. There is subtlety in American English that is difficult to emulate. In my opinion, you should not be asking them to take you as a PhD student. This is too blunt of a request because (1) you have not demonstrated why you are the ideal candidate, (2) you have not established what the professor even wants in a grad student (implying that you don't actually care about the topic of study, you just want to be accepted in the program), and (3) the professor doesn't know you as a human being so why would they agree preemptively to a stranger's email asking them for 6 years of their guidance, funding, and presence? Anyone can send an email and resume asking for a job. This doesn't motivate the employer to oblige. Also \"please have a look at it\" is too much of an ask. You will be lucky if the faculty even opens your email and now you're asking them to spend more time reviewing the resume after reading a generic email with poor grammar and spelling? There's nothing wrong with including a resume but it needs to be referenced more as optional because you should not be demanding more of their time. Something like \"I have attached my resume for your reference.\" is much more polite than \"please have a look at it.\"\n\n5. No conversation starter. You have attached a resume that they will probably not open. It needs to be clear in your email text why you are a great match for their program OR if you don't know what they specialize in, describing briefly your merit in one sentence (awards, research products like journal papers or conference papers) and then asking them if they have research interest in this subject would be much more stimulating than asking them a yes/no question about whether they're accepting students. Think about their potential responses to your email as you currently have written it. If their answer is yes, they're taking students, then does that imply that they will take you? No it doesn't. But that's a strange thing to write back in an email. No need for them to respond just to say \"yes I'm taking students but I'm not guaranteeing you a seat just because you emailed me.\" If their answer is no, then why would they even bother responding to you? It seems you only care about the program acceptance, not about intellectual curiosity. There is no conversation starter here. You need to establish your deep interest in the subject, not your eagerness to be accepted into the graduate program.\n\nThere is a fine art to emailing professors. Think about their perspective: working 8-12 hours a day, traveling often, doing field work, teaching classes, constantly being in meetings, and on top of that - getting 200 emails a day. An email like this is not worthy of a meaningful response, let alone a guarantee of 6 years of mentorship as an advisor. But don't feel too bad about it because this is a learned skill that you'll develop over the course of your graduate career. Many emails from people outside academia are similar to yours, but the good thing is you can always send another email that's better. However even after improving your email text, you may not get a response and that's perfectly normal. Like I said, half the time my own advisior does not respond to me. Try not to take it personally and try a different route (like contacting other lab members). Good luck and if you read all this, you're a champ.

Remember, you will most certainly work there for the next 5 years or so. Your research interests might change, your ideas might change, so I would suggest that you be a little more 'open' to what you want to work on next in your career.\n\nIn case your program does not let you do rotations, it is not necessarily bad. You can always change your advisers at any time. It is not frowned upon or looked down upon here in the US. There could be mismatch of interests at personal or professional level, and professors know this very well. You will have a few months' time to assess and evaluate your option before choosing a group. You can attend the group meetings, talk to fellow graduate students and make a decision in these first few months.\n\nWhile professors can potentially put a good word in with the admissions committee, you are not obliged to join the research group just because he/she helped you get in.

Your comment of \"If they are not taking any student then there is little benefit in reading their paper.\" indicates the logic of your email template. I think this is flawed logic from the perspective of the faculty member. If you have any intellectual curiosity, then you will naturally want to read a bit about their research before emailing them and asking to be their student for the next 6 years. If you consider learning about their research to have \"little benefit\" unless you get the tradeoff of a guarantee of an open PhD student seat, then you don't demonstrate a keen interest in their work. This is not the kind of student they would want. Of course if they don't seem to like you from the email, then they will be inclined to say \"no\" when asked if they are accepting students. You need to establish the contribution that YOU would give to them if you were their student - regardless of whether the option of being their student is even there.\n\nYou said that your intent was to get information about whether the faculty is taking a PhD student this year. From your email template, that was not my impression. It sounded to me like you wanted to know if you can be their student. This is beyond just identifying whether the faculty will hire new students this year. Asking to be someone's student is like asking for a relationship with someone who has never met you before and knows almost nothing about you except the information that you give them when you ask them for a relationship. If you show little understanding of who they are and what they do but you ask for a long-term relationship, that indicates to them that you either don't take the relationship very seriously or you are not picky in any way and will take whoever will accept you. This is not a great first impression.\n\nFrom your point of view, it may be a waste of time to look into any faculty research that won't transpire into your graduate program. But this is the first step in a long journey of learning \"useless\" things. Learning new things without promise of results is something you need to be comfortable with in grad school.

I am not sure about your specific context because every situation is different. I'm on my third year, and from almost the beginning until a few months ago it has been a never-ending rollercoaster of ups and downs. The downs have been some, if not *the,* lowest points in my life and I have been very close to quitting multiple times.   \n\n\nPeople here often give good advice, better than mine could be. I would advise you to do some soul-searching. What exactly is making you unhappy? Is it the lack of social life and/or life beyond your phd? Is it over-working and not enough mental space for other things? Is it the topic you are working on that does not align with what you truly want to do?  Is it academia in general and its toxic environment?  If you can identify the sources of your crisis, it might give you a clearer head for going forward and identifying possible steps.   \n\n\nFor me personally, it was a mix of things. I'm part of a project, and I felt like I didn't have the space to follow my 'true' academic interests. It was also a lack of mental space to socialize and spend time on my hobbies. This is coupled with having moved abroad, so my social life was practically non-existent anyway. I reached out for help from practitioners and my supervisor/colleagues. I would say don't be afraid to speak out as it really helped me, but I am not sure what the people surrounding you are like. I didn't have much to lose, because my alternative was quitting, but speaking out about my issues to my supervisor was very positive as he is allowing me to be more independent with my directions within the project. Maybe I was lucky, so this may not be a universal fix.   \n\n\nThe school counsellor and other people recommended that I think about what I would like to do instead, and that perhaps it would be good to have a concrete idea of what your actions would be if you do decide to quit. In that case, you can weigh in the different options. Maybe this could be a useful step for you, if you have not done that yet?   \n\n\nPersonally, what I have been doing more is doing this phd in my terms. Spending more time in pursuing my hobbies, allowing myself to meditate every morning, joining a tai-chi group, taking my bicycle for a spin as often as I can. This may all be different for you. Ultimately I have understood that there is a mental mechanism inside me that brings me into a crisis. The phd greatly exacerbates this process, but this would be happening to a lesser degree in whatever else I would be doing. The phd journey is, more than anything, a process of coming face-to-face with yourself. In the end, you really have to dig deep and think: is there a way I can make it through this without compromising myself and my mental wellbeing? At the end of the degree, would all this have been worth it? What about the future -  does this phd help me in doing the things I want to, even if I don't pursue a career in academia?  If you can't think of good reasons to anchor yourself into the phd, it is also totally okay to quit. It is completely normal for people to not finish the phd. And your life is your life at the end of the day. It is too short to spent the next 2,3,4 etc. years stuck doing something that makes you miserable.   \n\n\nIf you want a more positive spin, things are certainly going better for me at the moment. That's not to say that there won't be tough times ahead. The silver lining here is that being at the lowest points of your life allow you to think about what your priorities are in life. There is a longing inside, where something doesn't feel right. If you can listen to what that is saying, it could lead you to a path that resonates better with who you are inside. Sorry this turned into a bit of a ramble, and as I said other people will gives you better advice than mine so please take it with a grain of salt.

I even changed employers and relocated to a different country along the way. I\u2019m now preparing for the QE, and then onward to the dissertation itself.\n\nPeople talk about work-life balance... that\u2018s just fantasy in my experience. Something has to give. In my case, it was anything that looked remotely like a hobby. No more reading outside of the program, no more sports, no gaming, not much in the way of social outings either. Just the bare minimum to remain sane. I also outsourced and simplified as many logistical aspects of my life as I could, and relied on the personal support and understanding of close ones. I did lose touch with a few people along the way - I didn\u2019t have the energy to maintain all relationships.\n\nI estimate the coursework in my program to require ~25-30 hours per week (with two classes per term). In the first year, I would study every night after coming home from work. In the second year, I burnt out a bit from that and started packing the weekends with all-day and late-night studying instead. It\u2019s good to have days without thinking about the program too much, except for the minimal check-in you may have to do (online discussions, etc.). Some people call it a sprint, others a marathon. I like to see it as a combination of both, at least until the QE. The end of terms is always a horrendous period - lots of research to turn in means all-nighters to meet the deadlines. I got used to that and anticipated it better after the second or third term.\n\nThere are a couple of non-working, resident students in my program. Some days I envy them for not having to do anything other than focus on the PhD. Other days, I\u2019m glad and proud to have been able to juggle both work and studies. I took on the PhD for the intellectual challenge, and tackling both tracks has provided plenty. YMMV, and we had a late dropout recently (last semester of the second year) who failed a class due to personal reasons. That\u2019s really sad after investing so much effort and money.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that your current professional and personal life setup *will* change over the duration of the PhD. People get promoted, switch employers, change career paths, get married, get divorced, have kids, get really sick or have to care for someone who does, relocate, etc. So make sure to keep some buffer - if you are routinely maxed out, you won\u2019t be able to face any major change in your routine. Also rely on your advisor. Don\u2019t be shy about informing them of significant life events, and take a semester break if you need to get your work or life stuff in order. There\u2019s no glory in burning out and failing when you had the option to buy yourself some reprieve. Especially if you\u2019re working - it means you are not on a deadline to finish and resume earning an income at the earliest.

And getting a low grade or failing is just a small hiccup and you will get through it. Thats what phD advisors are there for. They want you to succeed and they will help you in any way throughout your career. \n\nRead about your research, the more you read the more confident you will be. And it\u2019s okay to be wrong or not know anything. This is why it\u2019s a five year long program and hence called training. You are training to be a scientist. \n\nHave a healthy social life, talk to your friends or colleague who are in same year or ahead of you. This helps you understand that you are not alone in this and you guys will get through it. For me personally, I am a very private person so I found a therapist which helped me a lot. And I spent at least an hour a day in the gym, this help me recharge mentally and help me physique which made me feel confident. Also it was way for me to get away from phd, like a mini break. But everyone\u2019s coping mechanism is different and you need to find yours.

One had his entire project fall apart when he found he was working on the wrong substrate. One decided in his 5th year to switch advisors to a completely different subdiscipline.\n\nI agree with you that 7 years isn't common for a full-time student, I just wouldn't go so far as to call it \"extremely abnormal.\"", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9sv7q9/us_science_phds_4_years/e8ssvke/"}, "1088": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AstraGlacialia", "Date": 1541012264, "Score": 3, "Body": "Some advisors are cool :p And this seems a good way to draw attention to the lab and thus attract prospective students and postdocs, which is important to some advisors.

It's not like she showed up and got best marks despite studying very little. She did not study, which actually means that during exams she often spoke nonsense and yet passed the exams. Imagine watching her being asked to draw the formula of glucose, seeing her draw two molecules of water, and walk away nonchalantly with A+. While this example is a bit exaggerated, this is not far from truth. (just to let you know, in our same university we found out a guy who did not show up at a few exams, yet the same exams were registered with the highest mark possible).\n\nIn regards to the first part: I don?t know about your university, but the general consensus is that you either \"publish or perish\". If you are able to do politics in your spare time that's ok, IMHO - but it sucks that people who actually are involved in research, that actually meet colleagues and actually care about daily clinical practice should be considered \"subpar\".\n\nReally, think about this.
