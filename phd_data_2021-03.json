It's ok if I daydream in class because I've finished all the work - my teacher didn't care as I was quiet and doing well. I had a temper at home but it was put down to stroppy girl/teen and never taken seriously. I had a ton of serious hobbies and was shuttled from one to the next - I never had to plan stuff, and I never had downtime to act up in. I didn't need any of the skills that I lack due to ADHD.\n\nUndergrad was the first place I was left to my own devices and I crashed and burned, but I had such a good academic record and it was a really good uni, so it was all put down to just stress and nothing ever came of it. I figured I was just stressed. And I actually went to uni counselling at one point because of pretty intense suicidal ideation. So this wasn't just ADHD. Now we reckon my ADHD then had a knock on effect and caused/exacerbated anxiety/depression/panic attacks. So the ADHD was masked for a long time because it wasn't so visible. And if you're getting top grades no one is thinking \"hmmm maybe she has ADHD\".\n\nSo all my ADHD symptoms (which I haven't really listed here, they're the typical ones, I guess) weren't obviously a problem. The only thing people saw was the anxiety etc. The first time I read about ADHD I was like \"I clearly don't have this\". I didn't see myself as a disorganised person. I was never late. However, I was incredibly anxious about being late (because I have an awful sense of time - ADHD) so I turned up everywhere half an hour early. I was incredibly organised because I was unable to remember stuff or survive without my many layers of planners and notebooks. Organisation was really really hard for me and my ADHD is mild enough that I could compensate, but it was exhausting. So on the face of it I had all the anti-symptoms of ADHD? I dunno. \n\nThis is getting long.

But I guess others here don't really agree with that idea.\n\nIt's an idea called the [\"privileged poor\"](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/17/18647250/privileged-poor-university-admissions-anthony-abraham-jack). Think of kids on free school meals who get scholarships to attend very prestigious high schools. Yes, they are from a poor family, but by attending that school they learn alongside the rich and gain privilege by it. Same thing with universities. If you attend a prestigious university then you're getting access to a different world, and you're being trained for that world. It's definitely hard and there's a big adjustment, but you do get the chance to train for the upper classes and for academia. People at lower ranked unis don't get that training.\n\nAnd all anyone sees on an application is where you went. They don't actually know you're poor. If you've been taking advantage of your school's career services and can now speak like the upper classes do (this was a big challenge for me, but I did it), then you're indistinguishable from them and you reap all the benefits of that.\n\nUniversities love to admit the privileged poor because we count in their \"poor\" statistics while also slotting in seamlessly to the wealthier culture. Roughly 50% of the poor students at top universities are privileged poor students who went to the top magnet high schools in the country.\n\nEdit: I think this sub is focussing way too much on family. I know that's the topic of the post, but let's be real here: no rich person is forming academic networks through their *mum*. All of your networks, all of your seamless knowledge about conferences and the intricacies of paying for Gold Access publications comes from your education. Someone who is educated alongside the elites is learning the hidden curriculum. The hidden curriculum is not taught by your parents, it's taught by your school. So attending a magnet high school and prestigious institutions for undergrad+ *absolutely* teaches you that hidden curriculum and gives you privilege, regardless of your parents' income. That's especially true if you're on a full-ride scholarship because your housing and living costs are covered.\n\nThe benefit of rich, educated parents is that they know to put you in the rich schools and have the means to. They know how different the schooling systems are for rich and poor and how important it is that you learn the hidden curriculum from a rich one.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lx2ykk/hang_in_there_fellow_firstgens/gpn47ia/"}, "565": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "officially_anxious", "Date": 1614857332, "Score": 2, "Body": "&gt;The university, realising this, focussed almost exclusively on preparing us to get jobs after our degrees, since this is what most of the other students cared about.

The bar is set extremely high, I met some amazing people. Maybe I'm less amazing than them but that's far from being stupid. \n\nSecond, even if they are better than me in some aspects, it doesn't mean they are better than me in everything. My advisor was very important to make me realize that, being very open about my weaknesses but also my strengths. So, I play with my strengths, instead of banging my head with my weaknesses. \n\nThird, it was clear to me that even professors struggled. For example, I remember one occasion when the professor suddenly decided to solve one of the problems from the book during the class, since we had plenty of time. He tried, tried, and gave up. He wasn't able to solve the problem either. So, if even professors with studied in placed like Harvard, MIT, and Berkeley have a hard time, I shouldn't feel too bad about it. \n\nBy the second year, I reached the conclusion that it was impossible for me to do as well as I would like to do for both research and my classes. It was just too much. I hope to be able to go back into that content again sometime, try to learn the things I was supposed to learn from those courses. \n\nI'm now in my 4th year.

But I'm finishing a PhD in a quant-based psych area, and I can tell you what I've seen work (and fail) for myself and my colleagues. Here's the lists of what I've seen work and what doesn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat works:\n\n\\- being practical about your research, especially dissertation. we can't change the world with one set of projects, so don't bite off more than you can chew. choose data you can easily gather or is already available. choose techniques you can easily learn or already know.\n\n\\- data-driven (empirical) work is usually shorter, more focused, and easier in my experience than theory-driven work. unless you're looking to stay in academia and especially move to a more theoretical area, like a business school, I've found the quant focus helps keep me straight to the point and reduces the length and complexity of intros, discussions, etc\n\n\\- planning your dissertation from the start. lots of my colleagues waited until after classes were over, after they passed comprehensive exams, and then started thinking about their idea for a dissertation. this will take you way longer, can reduce your momentum, and then lead you to fail/quit\n\n\\- check in often with people who keep you accountable, including but not limited to your PI. meeting with your advisor can create good pressure: it pushes you to have something new to show them. when you work with a writing group, or an accountability partner, its the same thing.\n\n\\- leave *lots* of time for the admin stuff. reviews, scheduling defenses, etc all take lots of time. I finished writing my dissertation before the end of last year, but I'll only be finished the degree in August.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat doesn't work:\n\n\\- being a perfectionist. if you're like that, you'll need to get into what I call perfectionist recovery. Nothing will ever be perfect, especially a dissertation\n\n\\- avoiding your advisor. Especially in the later years, many students fell into this cycle of withdrawal, shame, and anxiety. They never came to campus. They never spoke to their advisor. They were so worried about people asking them how they're doing, that they never did anything. This isolation is a *huge* problem, and happens when the majority of people quit, which is near the end. That means all their time didn't produce anything, but they still spent it in the degree.\n\n\\- isolating yourself from colleagues: it's easy, especially after classes are done, to just disappear from your class/cohort/colleagues. But that's not good for keeping you on track. Keep going to talks. Show up once in a while. Keep in touch with people. Isolation is the enemy here.\n\n\\- typically, trying to finish your degree after you get a full-time job at the end doesn't work. people have spent years in this stage, and it can be tough to find the time and motivation to write/edit/etc when you're already out. try not to go into a non-funded period if possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.

Some of them are kicked out and those are probably the failures you\u2019re thinking of. However I consider a failure anyone (including myself) who isn\u2019t able to get to the finish line they had in mind when they started their PhD. \n\nPeople fail all the time, not by failing out of the program, but by failing to be strategic in their choice of mentor. Think carefully and critically about the PI you choose as your primary mentor. Plenty of papers have been published indicating high quality mentorship is one of the primary sources of trainee success, as defined by a sense of self efficacy and productivity and an increased likelihood of becoming a high ranking researcher, in industry or academia. \n\nThe biggest way most people fail - including myself - is choosing a mentor who only works to serve their own interests. People ignore red flags all the time and doing so is the kiss of death. Now during rotations people will say things like \u201cto be successful here...\u201d....when they say things like that pay close attention because they\u2019re trying to share a red flag in a politically sensitive way. If people pause when asked how they like the lab or if they\u2019d choose the lab again given what they now know or any variant thereof you have your answer: run.\n\nThe other way people fail is by failing to remember one has to look out for oneself. No one is going to look out for your best interests if you don\u2019t and plenty of people will take advantage of you if you let them. When people, including your mentors, ask you to do something, carefully consider whether it serves your best interests to do that thing. If it doesn\u2019t then be a professional and advocate for yourself.\n\nThat leads me to my last point: people fail all the time by not realizing graduate school is professional apprenticeship. You should be spending time not just at the bench but also developing the soft skills that are needed to get the job you want. You pick a school for a reason, be sure to tap into all available resources at that school while you are there and spend time cultivating a strong professional network.

Once the equipment has been installed, it doesn't cost airlines much to have wifi in flight. But, if every person connected all of their devices to wifi, it would be unusably slow. Instead, charge a nominal 15 dollar fee. Most people won't be willing to pay anything extra. Some people would be willing to pay, but not 15 dollars. And some people will happily pay for access to the internet for their flight, and those people will actually be able to enjoy the service. Yes the airline makes money, but the reason the prices are set where they are is primarily to prevent too many people from using the service, not to maximize revenue. I'm sure they'd get twice as many people signing up for 8 dollars, but then those people wouldn't be able to use the service (and might ask for a refund, gasp).\n\nColleges use a similar system. If you want to fairly evaluate all applicants (and not just have an algorithm reject people), you need to have people as a part of the process. You need to keep total applicants down. So charge a fee. A fee of $100 means that most people are only going to apply if they have a very good chance of getting in (safety school), or if they really want to go to the school (reach schools). That way, you don't have every student mass applying to hundreds of schools, each of which would have to evaluate that student.\n\nAnd before you say \"what about the people who can't afford it\". Basically every school has some mechanism to submit applications without fees or recoup fees once they are admitted. Is it more work? Yes. But for anyone who would have an issue with paying the application fee, there are still ways to apply. \n\nAnd many EU schools are adopting a similar models. As students start implementing a strategy of applying en masse (the more applications you send, the more likely at least one of those applications will be successful), schools need to implement strategies to cope.\n\n\nFor PhD positions however, since that's far closer to actual employment than a Bachelor or Master degree, I have no idea how you justify that.

There are a few reasons for this:\n1. You\u2019ll be more successful in a PhD program with more research experience under your belt. It\u2019s possible that people in your PhD program will already have masters degrees, so you may have to catch up (which is pretty tough to do; 2 years of research experience is huge at that level).\n2. Grad school is not like undergrad at all. If you don\u2019t like it then you can tough it out for 2 years and get masters. If you don\u2019t like it and you\u2019re in a PhD program... you either have to tough it out for 4-5 years or walk away and then you have no degree from that time.\n3. On the same note as above, if anything goes wrong in a PhD program and you have to leave then you still only have a bachelors degree. You could have done *more work* than a masters degree and be 3 years in... and you would still only have a bachelor\u2019s degree if you had to leave your PhD program. Which, unfortunately, is not uncommon; family emergencies, illness, life circumstances, toxic environments, pregnancy + kids, or simply changing your mind are all things that can and do happen that stop people from completing their PhDs. If that happens and you went direct to PhD... you still only have a bachelors degree.\n\nIt is possible to circumvent this, though. If you decide to go direct to PhD inquire about getting a masters as part of the program. A masters is really just one research project and I know people who have talked to their program directors about being granted a masters during a PhD. Especially if you identify as a woman (women\u2019s careers still take bigger hits than men from life setbacks) this is something I would suggest looking into.\n\nI did a masters before my PhD and have no regrets. I loved my masters so much and I got into a top PhD program thanks to my experience.

I made some serious efforts to find friends after the separation and eventual divorce. I had to open up my circle wide. I asked acquaintances, mostly other grad students to lunch, dinner, or a game night. I joined a book club that forced my brain to get out of academia an hour a night to read something unrelated to work, then I'd meet with complete strangers to mostly trash talk the book. What saved my sanity was probably meeting with other grad students. Lunch and dinner hangouts eventually became weekly trivia nights where we'd hangout, complain about our PIs and research, drink, and vent. Depending on where you are this might be tough with pandemic restrictions but with spring coming, outdoor hangouts in many areas will be more available. \n\nRight now, I keep sane with zoom calls with the old trivia crew even though we're spread from one end of the U.S. to the other.

The department head **should** be receptive and willing to help. \n\nNext step: find another faculty member to work with. This is where it is very important to have the department head on your side, or at least know what's going on. Let any prospective faculty members know that higher-ups already know what's going on. That makes them less likely to feel predatory for taking a student from another professor, and also less likely to think that you're a red flag. \n\nStart with department approval and figuring out your jump, then at the VERY END get the approval of your advisor.

I would say that the methods in economics are similar to the ones used in quantitative marketing, but the context and the variables are different. \n\nPeople in economics will apply those methods to study things like labor market and interest rates, for example. While people in marketing will apply those methods to study advertising, digital marketing, branding, consumer attitudes, and salesforce management, for example.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m1gmxy/what_is_the_difference_between_a_phd_in_economics/gqe53g4/"}, "1290": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "QuantumNature", "Date": 1615337722, "Score": 7, "Body": "hey, I dropped out of my PhD in my 5th year, I know your pain. It will be ok, you'll be, eventually, better for it, regardless of your path. Dropping out was a good choice for me, because I actually want a PhD. I'm a romantic academic and, like you, shot for the moon in my project, but it didn't work out because of reasons. I still want my degree, but I want to be proud of and enjoy it too, and I wasn't. So I left and now I still have that opportunity available, and I'm excited for it. If I had fought my way through and got the degree, I would have hated it all, it would have ruined the experience and I'd have left exhausted. Instead, I left, I traveled, I thought about what I want and started an ambitious company, which also hasn't worked yet but is now a side project for whatever comes next. Now, a couple years after my withdrawal I can't say I've found success, but it isn't because I don't have a PhD. I'm applying to jobs soon and I state my \"attempted doctorate\", along with my \"undefended research\" and I'm proud of the experience. I tried to do something so big, I couldn't figure it out after years of intense effort, likely I was onto something but me alone in my situation couldn't solve it. My degree failed for many reasons, but I've learned much and I intend to one day return and do truly great work, instead of just graduating. I've also stayed on good terms with my advisors and colleagues, which I will soon ask for help in my job hunt. \n\nI also think I was too young to do a doctorate, I had done an MSc and BSc, but had not yet actually seen the world. A doctorate leverages deep real world experience, of which I still have none. We can return when we are ready, academia will persist, it may even improve, surely it can't get worse. Even if we are old, it will make graduation day that much more special. We still have our opportunity to drink at the campus pub as students.\n\nTo you I send my love, sympathy and hugs.

Whenever I put my game face on and try to write, negative emotions flood in then I put writing off again...and the cycle repeats.\n\nInterestingly, I came across an article that says procrastination is an emotional regulation issue...The past years, I had been beating myself up for being \"lazy\"...but deep down, I know it was not being lazy but sort of a trauma response. Anyway, if you have time, feel free to read this article. It helped me reframe how I viewed my situation.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html\n\nSince last year, I am learning to allow self to feel the pain while I write...to write even if I don't feel like it or not feeling motivated or inspired (but being conscious to be kind and gentle towards myself)\n\nWhat helped me jumpstart my writing is commit in showing up in front of my laptop no matter what I am feeling. It does not need to be a grand time to write. But bite size writing is what worked for me. I set a 5 minute timer for initial writing and if it flows, I set 10 minute timers. I sometimes choose some 5-10 min instrumental music as timer.\n\nBut if writing still sucks, still dry and nothing comes out, I try to record my voice while walking in circle or pacing back and forth and tell what I want to say even if it is not coherent or relevant. This predictable movement serves as a push or momentum, instead of sitting down and hating myself...moving helps just to get something rolling. \n\nAnother idea/metaphor that helped me is to commit to \"turn on the faucet\" so that water can flow in whatever amount. Writing is turning on the faucet. Also accepting that sometimes writing without direction could work too. It is like learning by doing/writing. It helps me trust beyond myself, trust the process, trust something beyond me...believing that something forms as I show up and continue to write, accepting the mess as it is. \n\nWhen negative emotions come up again, \nI also do a lot of breathing exercises...Especially when panic attack visits me, alternate nostril breathing exercises help me a lot to cope (that's breathing with one nostril at a time, I watch youtube for that)\n\nAlso I remind myself that \"drafts are supposed to be shitty\"....the more I write, it could get clearer along the way, but what I need is to get my hands dirty, be willing to get my hands dirty. I even have some written reminders about how drafts are supposed to be shitty and put it near my desk. \n\nOh, it also helps me to write physically - using pen and notebooks, especially if I am stuck in front of the computer tooo long and hating myself. I used a loooot of notebooks, scratch papers and even huge Manila papers and pentel pen especially during days if I am brainstorming or thinking about paper flow/bigger picture/organization of the research. I draw mental maps, write keywords and even repeating ideas over - in some days, serenditpity comes in :) \n\nAnyway, these actions may not work with other people but sharing my own experience just in case it could be relevant :) \n\n--\n\nAs for my writing journey, I am relieved to share that I already defended and passed this January (after x years of being paralyzed and stuck in a dark place). I am still not done with certain edits but I am grateful to get this far. \n\nPhD had been this dark night of the soul and I remember the days that I just wanted to throw the towel. The delay was indeed humbling..it taught me radical tenderness/gentleness towards myself (and still learning) and grateful for people who I cried with along the way. \n\nAnyway, just want to say that you're heard and you're not alone.

I am in no way a night owl, haven't been one since high school, so when I say writing at night I mean that I go to bed early, like 4-5 in the evening and wake up around midnight, which is when I start my day. I work from midnight to 2-3 in the afternoon. I find the early hours to be serene. There are no distractions like emails, messages and stuff from the internet so it is perfect for me to sit for hours and just write. Plus the silence of the night really helps me focus on my writing. I feel like admitting to oneself that you are not perfect and are still learning helps keep anxiety and the imposter syndrome at bay. Plus me wanting to prove myself to my prof is an added source of motivation that helps me to keep going.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m1lfoj/how_to_not_let_writing_procrastination_becoming_a/gqfpkxq/"}, "1329": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "fakeidforspam", "Date": 1615377226, "Score": 3, "Body": "This sounds wise.

From my experience as a PhD student that tried, crash and burn (more like crunch and burn out) and has dealt with anxiety driven procrastination for a long time, the HEALTHIEST and MOST PRODUCTIVE thing I have ever done was working normal 9-5 hours/Mon-Fri.   Of course they are not set on stone, of course there are periods where you have to stretch the work day or pull some extra work on the weekends. But having a consistent Work routine that is not ever lasting is absolutely important. If your PI does not respect that than I believe it is better you are out anyways.\nMy university is not prestigious nor is my lab one of the big boys publishing in big boys journals. But we are a decent lab, publishing in decent journals and for all its worth the idea you have to work indefinitely to get things done is a fallacy. Management is kind of everything, besides it is very odd that he was so upset about you working 8h at the start of your PhD no last! By the projections he would be expecting you to work 120h/week by the time you graduated! Lol\n\nAlso about work hours on your prospective jobs, that is also a fallacy. Yes academia is hard work and yes work hours are not fixed. That doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwork every waking hour\u201d, that means we have the responsibility (and freedom) to manage our work accordingly. And I think that\u2019s where a lot of confusion happens and one if the contributors to so many stories of burn out, toxic workplaces, toxic work culture and mental health issues in academia. A well managed lab or job will have you work reasonably and respect your right and need to rest and set a routine that is sustainable. And these places do exist and are successful. \n\n\nSo take a deep breath and heal from your experience and rest assured not all labs are like what you experienced, not all PIs are unreasonable like your last PI and a PhD although hard is manageable and does not have to be a soul crushing ride from start to finish.\nI have had a bad advisor early in my academic training. I too got fired, and in cinematic fashion on the hallway due to a miscommunication. It stings until today but as time went by I learned from the experience and here I am years later about to graduate with a work I actually feel proud of. So don\u2019t lose faith just yet. If you decide to not go back, that\u2019s totally fine, god knows how many times I wanted to quit. Just make sure you\u2019re taking care of yourself and don\u2019t be afraid to look for places where you can thrive. They exist and I hope you do a terrific job whenever you\u2019re ready to go back. \nPeace \u270c\ufe0f", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m2vpsk/kicked_out_after_10_weeks/gqltw3b/"}, "1495": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "the-anarch", "Date": 1615491715, "Score": 2, "Body": "Prepare for the downvotes speaking reality like that.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lzrvcc/do_you_treat_your_phd_as_a_95/gqlwsei/"}, "1496": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Aakkt", "Date": 1615495003, "Score": 3, "Body": "What the fuck", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m2vpsk/kicked_out_after_10_weeks/gqm48g2/"}, "1497": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "optimization_ml", "Date": 1615495976, "Score": 3, "Body": "4 th year PhD student here.

While I will just take your word that there is some other factor other than psychological ones, know that what our third friend says is \"real life\".\n\nReal life reading list: [https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-keep-my-sanity-at-work-after-a-new-coworker-is-too-efficient-at-her-job-She-has-also-upset-the-dynamics-in-the-department-I-want-her-gone?share=1](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-keep-my-sanity-at-work-after-a-new-coworker-is-too-efficient-at-her-job-She-has-also-upset-the-dynamics-in-the-department-I-want-her-gone?share=1)\n\nTo add to the entire long list of human stories &amp; anecdotes there, Third friend went into the workforce much earlier and when she at junior level, she was severely hazed. By some bullies who had entered before her just 1-1.5 years before - like deliberately scolding her in front of everyone to stand and not leave the bullies' office to go to the waiting cab where even more senior staff were waiting for her to go to a mainly director-level ministerial event that third friend was invited to but not the bully. Almost like trying to make her look bad in front of the bosses and getting into trouble! She was then reported to HR by the bully for 'failing in her work (bc she had left to go to the event and did not do that bullies' work pronto) and harassed like that once every other week. My own middle school friend went to a bank where the existing staff (she was 22ish, rest were 30s, 40s, 50s) ganged up on her because she had a degree (Wth?) and the rest other than the boss did not. They kept gossiping and telling on her on the boss. She was a new hire, entry-level and eager to make herself look 'hardworking' and when she worked past hours, even to finish her work, she would get hazed by others who felt like they would have to stay longer so they don't look bad in comparison. She lived like this being scolded if she couldn't finish on time, and scolded again if she stayed late to finish it. I can see why the others would get annoyed, but I think the boss should just not show a preference for people who work late vs not, rather than enable workplace drama.\n\nShort message is, it's great academic bubble is clean, but don't go around dismissing things as if it doesn't exist. Un-ivory towerize your perception and recalibrate it to the real world, because real world exists.\n\nSubstantively, other than finding out your environment is clean, I still don't know why on earth the first senior would even get rejected.\n\nYes, maybe I \"really do not have any understanding of the grad school process\", but isn't that why I'm even here? I left school the latest, and am trying to help someone who is very close and am hoping to figure out where all these invisible walls that you know but we don't know are so she doesn't have to keep knocking her head into those, and I would be able to avoid when it's my turn to apply. Since we can't see a direct reason, we draw as close a parallel to the real world as a working hypothesis, and if you know it's not true, just state some constructive counter hypothesis rather than just dismissing it as 'ridiculous'.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m2tt99/honestly_do_you_get_jealous_of_phd_applicants/gqn4cah/"}, "1528": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "happypiggo", "Date": 1615513014, "Score": 1, "Body": "Oh gosh that sounds like an accusation lol.

There are also a lot of former top consultancy/ top law firm/ big 4 women who quit bc the system is end-heavy, meaning at the start people are worked more but get disproportionately less profits bc those profits are pooled for the partners at the later part of the career.

These people tend to strive for work-life balance or their families so I think such side gigs are suitable. Although, these people are actual professionals with that sort of exp you need for consulting to begin with so they're going to be asked to be paid at pro consultant, lawyer, ib-er rates pro rata too, and not student rates. I know a few people in the latter who may be interested and I can connect you professionally if you need to, but be warned you need to offer professional rates rather than 'experience'.\n\nFinally, retired adjunct profs?

You can find a lot of information over on /r/IWantOut.\n\n&gt; 1) If we move to the EU will we have to pay for healthcare on a work permit?\n\nDepends on the country, but probably. The difference is that healthcare is often way more affordable. In Germany, you pay 200\u20ac/month and that covers basically everything. I know you can add your spouse to your insurance plan, but I don't know the rates for that. In NL, it's somewhere between 100\u20ac - 200\u20ac/month with a copay of 385\u20ac/year (you need to pay this amount before insurance kicks in, so similar-ish to the US, but still a fuckton cheaper).\n\n&gt; 2) How would a self-employed person be categorized for a work permit?\n\nDepends on the country. If you and your spouse are married, your spouse should be fine if you have a work visa. Usually you can bring your spouse over, but again, this depends on the country (sometimes there are salary limits, though you are very likely going to meet any minimum salary requirement). Otherwise, some EU countries have freelancer visas.\n\n&gt; Do the universities/ employers help sponsor the post-doc and their family? Provide them a place to rent/ establish residency/ apply for citizenship?\n\n\"Sponsor\" in an immigration context usually ONLY means help you get the visa, and in that sense most universities will probably help you do that. My current university has a whole office dedicated to helping foreign staff members sort out visa issues (they also provide advice on living in NL, but mostly they just sort out the visa for everyone).\n\nI would say it's highly unlikely your university would find you a place to rent, that will be your responsibility.\n\nAs for \"establish residency\", this can mean a number of things in an immigration context. If you mean, \"register your address\", the university will likely not help you beyond telling you what to do. That said, this process is usually pretty trivial. If you mean \"earning permanent residency\", the university will also not help you there. Permanent residency (PR) is earned after spending a significant amount of time in a country without leaving. The amount of time depends on the country.\n\nAs for applying for citizenship, the university also isn't going to help there either. Naturalization requires earning PR first, and then spending more time in country. You'll also need to pass citizenship and language tests, and you may need to forfeit your US citizenship (again, this depends on the country). Many expats live their entire lives overseas and never naturalize. \n\n&gt; 4) What are the EU guidelines for permit-holders starting families? Is there paid leave for researchers/spouses during pregnancy?\n\nAgain, country specific. I think if you're attempting to do your own research, you might be getting tripped up by the fact that this is all country specific policies, not EU policies.\n\nThat said, I do not know of a country that does not allow those on a work permit to not have families, I'm fairly confident that's not a restriction anywhere. Almost all jobs in the EU are going to have some kind of maternity or paternity leave. The specifics of this will depend on the country you're in, as well your your university (the country will set specific minimums, and the university will decide how far above those minimums the leave will be).\n\nI think the problem you're having finding answers to your questions is that you're trying to find EU wide answers, and those aren't going to exist.

Starting a PhD especially one where I'm expected to teach, I have a lot more meetings than I'm used to. I was struggling to keep track of where various discussions were.\n\nSo I started a strategy of obsessively taking notes during every meeting. I've been using notion, but other note taking apps are available.\n\nI have a meeting with my supervisor every week, where we talk about what I've done, ideas for moving forward, etc. I write down basically everything that's said during these meetings, at least everything of note. That way, if I'm ever confused about how to move forward, or about an idea we discussed, I can look back at the notes of our meetings.\n\nJust recently, we felt like a concept we were working on sounded familiar to something we discussed a couple months ago. I went back through my notes, and sure enough, I was able to find the highlights of our discussion. \n\nFor me, this serves as my way of keeping reasoning over time. Every decision that I make I generally run past my supervisor. She usually agrees with me, which is great because I'll be sure to include my reasoning in my meeting notes.\n\nYou could try something similar. If you don't have regular meetings, just take regular notes where you write down what you're thinking. I like doing it in meetings since those have a definite end (so I don't spend too much time writing notes about my decision making), also, since I have to type ridiculously quickly, I only put down the most important things, so it becomes a good filter of what gets put in my notes. \n\nThis also only works because I can type pretty quickly without looking at my screen.

It\u2019s not easy to exactly pin down what that is though, and it might depend on your background and experiences. The main strengths I\u2019ve gathered through my PhD are critical thinking and a strategic, structured approach - so I went with that and didn\u2019t actually prepare too much for the interview. In the end, that worked out very well for the cases I got. I identified the main issues, asked questions to gather relevant information, was transparent about how I\u2019d approach them and generally just used a \u201ecommon sense\u201c approach. No rocket science tbh. My cases ranged from health care, automated driving, wedding planning business to energy efficiency, and in hindsight I couldn\u2019t have prepared for any of those. I struggled with some calculations, actually got some wrong (at some point even suggested that I\u2019d just guess to proceed but was told to redo them, ugh), but kept a clear head and moved on. I think I didn\u2019t even fully \u201ecrack\u201c half of the cases in the end.

It sounds like you feel you are doing averagely or poorly at work when probably you are doing pretty well. Chances are they will want to keep you in the job, provided you are doing a good job \u2013 they probably like you and it would save them a lot of time and money finding someone else to do it. So, do well, but..... possibly relax the pressure a bit.\n2. **Let people at your work know you are finishing the thesis and it will be done in five weeks.** Chances are they will be understanding (and if they won't be - do you really want to work at the organisation?).\n3. **Spend LESS time but MORE OFTEN on your thesis.** You said you are only working on it on weekends; and I would bet that you are setting aside massive chunks of time on the weekend to \"work on PhD.\" Consider instead doing 30 minutes every day (write a few paragraphs), maybe 3 x 1.5 hour chunks on the weekend = 4.5 hours on weekend days. See e.g. this article by Cal Newport: [https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2008/02/15/fixed-schedule-productivity-how-i-accomplish-a-large-amount-of-work-in-a-small-number-of-work-hours/](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2008/02/15/fixed-schedule-productivity-how-i-accomplish-a-large-amount-of-work-in-a-small-number-of-work-hours/) And Cal Newport tells the story elsewhere of someone who got up from 6-8 in the morning before work, worked on their PhD, and then went through the rest of their day guilt free.\n4. **\"Don't dread, draft\":** The quicker you can get a working draft done, the better. Often it's better to get a bunch of stuff out of your head into a doc and you can then go through again and edit it - that way you feel \"safe\" because you know you always have something you could submit if you really needed to.\n5. **Often we create a LOT of the stress we experience** \\- if you work in focused chunks, you can not only finish your thesis, you can do it really well and in a relatively relaxed way.\n\nGood luck :) You can do it :)\n\nPS - I agree with some of the people who have said, \"Take a day off\" - but you will only benefit from this if you have a plan that you know will work and you can trust the process.

I did some homework on the faculty and had a list of people I  thought might be compatible with my research interests and she gave me a short list of people I should explore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI set up meetings and dropped by in office hours for a few of the professors on the list, but pretty quickly clicked with my now advisor (this was about 3 months before application deadline). As previously mentioned, she gave me the heads up that the program I was applying for was extremely competitive and recommended that I start looking for grants and fellowships. She said I might not get one, but if I did, it would help strengthen my application. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI applied for an NSF fellowship and started looking into others. In my case the weird thing happened where I was rejected from my top choice program, and 2 months later awarded the huge grant. Unfortunately the department was unwilling to reconsider admitting me; but since my advisor was also part of a different department, she was able to transfer my application into her home department. If I hadn't found my own funding, I definitely would not be in my program right now.  \n\n\nThe other perk of having funding going in is that it has given me more flexibility in my research. I basically just wrote my ideal research plan down on my application, so now I get to come in studying exactly what I'm interested in.

Here to give you some cheering and support. After 4 years of PhD I started writing my thesis but then things got so bad with my supervisor I ended up having to change lab and restart a project from zero. Fast forward 2 years and 3 months, I had to wrap up my project, with 1 month to write (I kind of rushed to fix a deadline because after 6 years I was more than exhausted) and absolutely nothing written (because I had started the project later on, I hadn't written a research proposal which meant I didn't even have bits and pieces of an introduction...). \n\nThe last month was intense. I also have a professor who is very picky and he made me re-write over and over again the introduction which meant I received his feedback on the discussion 1 day before the submission... there is good and bad in this, because I had feedback, but the feedback just added more layer of pressure (also didn't help having my supervisor call my writing \"amateurish\" xD). Anyway, I didn't sleep much and ate very little. I also hated myself every single day. I think in any condition the last stretch is really hard because you just have to make whatever data you have gathered work and combine in a thesis. It's a process full of doubts and it happens at the end of very tiring years.\n\nWhat made it easier was just finding the way to start the parts in the writing. Once I started I felt like time just flew by. Your situation is very tricky because you are already working on another project but you also have some of the writing done. I agree with many people, try to find a way to have breaks, it is essential for you to hold on to the end. Try to take a day off to sleep and rest, hopefully it helps just get a nudge to feel less burnt out. I don't know if you could also take a few days off from your work to focus on the writing, it can be easier to get in a zone of focus in which you can get into writing and advance as much as possible (even if the writing is aweful) and then making edits and corrections on the evenings if needed. \n\nWhat you're going through is hard, I feel you. Hold in there, it would be shame to snap at the very end. Take care of yourself: this PhD is temporary, your mental health is forever.

It is quite lonely too - none of the other PhDs in my faculty have kids - and even most of the academics are not the primary carer for their children as I am, so nobody really gets it.\n\nI don't regret it per say, but I definitely wouldn't do it again! That being said, if your children are relatively independent (a bit older, no additional needs) and/or you are absolutely awesome at compartmentalizing and multi-tasking (both of which I struggle with) or your partner is the primary carer and you have no money struggles, then maybe you will be fine \ud83d\ude01", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m4kr0g/is_anyone_balancing_parenting_and_a_phd/gqvv9gl/"}, "1798": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SnooCakes1148", "Date": 1615713361, "Score": 1, "Body": "Working in hospital and our lab has been handling covid samples so we got vaccinated with Moderna, got my first dose recently", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m4eu1p/has_anyone_been_able_to_get_vaccinated_because/gqvvbhl/"}, "1799": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Spaceandbrains", "Date": 1615713558, "Score": 2, "Body": "So you're doing a 5 year PhD... so you have 3 years left.

Aim to write between 5,000 words and 10,000 words per week. Divide that up over 5 months. You need to leave 1 month for revisions and 1 month for referencing and formatting and last minute changes. At a minimum.\n6. Be clear on what you want to achieve in the chapter you are writing. There is no point writing if it's not relevant. \n7.

If the work is mostly experimental, and depending on the complexity of the experiments, availability of resources and helping hands and so on, often there are not many options available other than working long hours - even through the weekend. I work in a lab where we have been facing resource shortages since time immemorial, and the PI kept pushing me to find 'clever solutions' to problems despite these shortages and consistently deliver on time. I have lost count of how many experiments have failed, and how many different approaches I had to try to solve each and every technical annoyance I faced during my research. I have enviously watched fellow grad students in well-funded labs being able to place orders for whatever they need, and have masters or undergrad assistants to help them out with grunt work. I also often had to rush to complete a set of experiments so that I could schedule the use of certain equipment that I need to use in another lab. Unfortunately, deadlines are an unavoidable aspect of research life, and experiments rarely work out in time despite the best made plans. On top of all this, in many groups there is always a push for deriving positive results from projects - so this leads to constant experimentation and problem resolution until desired results can be brute forced. I found that the reason these things keep happening is because many PI's keep running after grants for which they need preliminary data. Generating good quality preliminary data without access to sufficient resources in a short amount of time is just not often feasible. Besides, a large majority of STEM PhD students are international students, at least in the US - for whom it is difficult to switch universities or grad programs due to student visa complications. These grad students typically quietly suffer whatever kind of work culture is forced on them for years and years.\n\n\nSince you are just starting out, I would advise you to keep an eye out for things like this and make a move as soon as possible before you get trapped within a few years. After a couple of semesters, making the decision to leave the group becomes significantly difficult due to many, many factors. This is checklist for things you need to figure out ASAP:\n\n* Long-term funding situation of the lab for research activities\n* Availability and length of grad student financial support either from PI or from department\n* Availability of critical equipment necessary for the core research performed by the group\n* PI's experience or depth of knowledge in technical domain.

Interesting question, but not easy to answer :) Since this hugely depends on both the individual PhD experience (field, country, relationship with advisor etc) as well as the consulting experience which makes a general comparison somewhat difficult. My PhD is in sociology, in Europe, on a full-scholarship (which means I don\u2019t work at my faculty); my consulting experience in the public sector at MBB with a great project team.\n\nOn paper, the \u201cmeasurable stress\u201d at consulting was definitely higher, regarding working hours, required output in short timeframes, working on complex topics without any prior knowledge, pressure to do well at every task given etc. In comparison, the stress in my PhD is more underlying - and therefore, I would argue, ultimately more toxic. \n\nThe success of your PhD is *really* all down to yourself. Some aspects you can navigate (i.e. research topic, motivation, time-management, writing skills), but considering a PhD is a long-term undertaking (in Europe ~5 years in my field) it\u2019s not easy to be consistent, self-driven and disciplined over such a long period of time. You can\u2019t really prepare for this constant personal challenge (one of the reasons why there are so many drop outs, similar to consulting) and there is little opportunities within academia to actively develop the required skills (whereas MBB give you plenty of resources to get the training/support you need). \n\nAnd then, there are the many things you have no control over (advisor, career chances, publishing opportunities, financial dependence). This sub is full of stories of what can go wrong, especially when it comes to the delicate relationship with supervisors. So, most of us put a ton of energy, dedication, time and effort into our research, while being constantly aware (afraid!) that it might still not be enough, ripped apart, ignored or outdone by others. I know, feedback can be harsh in consulting, but usually one isn\u2019t very attached to their slides or pivot tables, whereas it\u2019s way more difficult to not take feedback to your research/thoughts/writing personal.\n\nBut most importantly, the prospects are fundamentally different. For many the PhD is supposed to be the first step towards an academic career. But job opportunities in academia are scarce, making it a highly competitive field. So, while juggling all the above, you also have immense pressure to do well, because your whole future career depends on it. This, for many, leads to overwork, self-doubts, stress and ultimately burn-outs. At the same time, if you\u2019re already disillusioned about your academic career, you realise that finding a job outside of it is also incredibly hard, because you compete with those who already gained valuable job experience while you were fulfilling your idealistic PhD dreams. Again, pressure is on.\n\nIn contrast to these uncertainties of PhD students, as a (MBB) consultant, you\u2019ve already made it. The work experience and prestige of the companies (at least here) are opening you plenty of future opportunities and career paths to choose from. Having this sense of self-worth (regarding job chances) is something that many PhDs are lacking.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m3l4by/phd_to_consulting/gr21j61/"}, "1984": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CoastStarlight", "Date": 1615842956, "Score": 2, "Body": "Sorry to say but generally \"informing the result\" often implies that they will not inform it if they decided not to select the person.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m5txt5/potential_advisor_yes_or_no/gr22r6b/"}, "1985": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Unlikely_Carrot_", "Date": 1615843131, "Score": 1, "Body": "So saying \u201cI\u2019ll let you know either way\u201d means they won\u2019t let me know either way?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m5txt5/potential_advisor_yes_or_no/gr234l0/"}, "1986": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CoastStarlight", "Date": 1615843381, "Score": 1, "Body": "What I am saying is that people will often avoid informing the bad news.

I'd say it's easier to get by in Denmark without knowing Danish than it is getting by in Germany without knowing German. The simple reason is that almost everyone in Denmark speaks English (since it's a small country) whereas the same is not true in Germany. German is definitely far easier to learn than Danish. I know I am biased, but German is structured and generally easy to get a hold of once you've learned the basics. Danish is *very* tricky with regards to pronunciation (there's a reason Sweden and Norway make fun of us for our language). \n\nLiving in Copenhagen is *extremely* expensive. I don't know what Bonn is like but there's almost a 100% chance that it's significantly cheaper than Denmark. With a PhD position in Denmark you should be able to afford to rent a place pretty easily though but you should adjust your expectations, i.e. you should not expect to live in the heart of Copenhagen. Also day-to-day stuff, like shopping and eating out, is very expensive in Copenhagen.  \n\nThe upside is that Copenhagen is one of the greatest cities in the world. In terms of culture, life, events, options, etc etc there's really a lot going on. You might ask yourself if you want to participate in an active cultural life. There's little reason to spend all that money to live in Copenhagen unless you want to do all those things. Obviously getting a PhD at Copenhagen Uni would be great and in itself is a huge motivator. \n\nI don't know about your wife. I think there are plenty of options in Copenhagen for English-only people (the situation is very different in other parts of the country). Copenhagen is obviously exceptionally international so I'd be surprised if she can't find something, depending on her field etc. If she's entirely untrained and unskilled then she might have a bad time unless she's ready to do some kind of courier work. I might be wrong. I don't know about Bonn, but my experience in Germany is that it is *very hard* to find a job unless you know German. I can't generalize though, I'm sure it's possible, but my impression is that it is difficult. Germany is still very formal and very traditional; they will expect you to conform to their standards and their language (outside the university at least). Even within the university you'll find that a lot of official material is still in German (even in international programmes!) so it can be hard to navigate without knowing German. Denmark can be hard to navigate too for foreigners but at least people speak English.\n\nIn terms of making friends, Denmark is notoriously difficult for foreigners since we're a 'closed-off' people. We don't want to talk to you on the train or while waiting for the bus. We don't want to be asked, \"How are you?\" unless it is part of an actual conversation. We want to be left alone... but once you're part of the inner-circle then everything becomes bright flowers and happy sunshine! I know from several first-hand accounts (particularly from Americans) how hard it can be to transition to life in Denmark since people are very different. We generally interpret the American over-the-top friendliness and extroversion as somewhat disingenuous and fake. I'm saying this to give you a realistic image of what others have gone through. There are many Facebook pages for Americans (and other expats) in Denmark so you might want to ask there and get some perspective. If you put in some effort and try to make friends then you'll have a great time. Danish people *are* friendly but we're just not outgoing and we're probably not going to actively seek you out. \n\nI can't really speak for Bonn. I had an easy time making friends in Germany through the university and my PhD programme but Germans and Danes are very similar in many ways so the cultural difference to me was minimal. \n\nJob market post-PhD depends on your field. Germany is a lot bigger obviously so if you're willing to move around and know German then I imagine that finding a job is easier in Germany, but who knows?

I'm in the humanities, so my funding was tied to teaching. I was able to find some adjunct work nearby in the last few semesters in which I was a TA, so my CV was fairly robust by the time I moved. I cold emailed colleges in the area I was moving to and asked about adjuncting. My first semester here kinda sucked, because I had to commute forty minutes for really low pay, but as I got to know the area I found work at a better-paying college with friendly colleagues who really took me in. It's been wonderful (as far as adjuncting goes), and I also moved to a place with a much much lower cost of living, so that's been helpful. \n\nIt's been manageable, but I think what will make you successful or not will be your own discipline. It's very easy to get caught up in moving, planning a wedding, and everything else that happens (pandemics too, apparently), and it's hard to get back to work if you shelve your project for too long. You need to be able to strike a balance between saying \"I'm going to give myself time to enjoy or work on this part of my personal life\" and \"it's time to get down to work.\" I wish I had been better about that. \n\nThe nice thing moving forward is that almost everyone is much more amenable to working remotely. You can set deadlines for yourself and enforce them by scheduling zoom meetings to discuss your work with your advisor (or colleagues).

As researchers, we often start a project that looks promising, but later we see that things are not as we expected. If you are too committed to a project that is doomed, or that won't get you the results that you need. then it's going to be a problem. \n\nAlso, research is not something that has a clear end. There is always more to do. More papers to read, more data to collect, more methods that you could use, more variables that could be included, another revision of your writing. So, how can you finish something that is never finished? This is often a struggle. If we do too little, it's not enough to get a PhD or be published, for example. But if we try to do everything that we can or that we would like to do, we would never end, because there is no end. There a comic strip with a joke about that, saying that you're finished when your funding is finished. So, you need to know when to stop, when you can consider something finished even if you feel like it's not finished at all. \n\nYeah, defending your research is intimidating. There is a lot to talk about this, more than I can do here. But I think it's good to remember the purpose of defending your research, or at least finding what is your own purpose for that. What motivates you. Make the motivation stronger than the fear. \n\nAs researchers, we are often entering uncharted territory. Seeking answers when we don't even know if there is an answer or a way to find the answer. Dead ends, failures, mazes, traps are part of the journey as we explore things like an adventurer. It's how research works. But, without that, we wouldn't get to our goals, to the results, the discoveries. Imagine how problematic scientific discoveries would be if people were not critical of findings. Research is expected to be scrutinized. Some people go overboard with that, but a lot of people also have good intentions (even when sometimes it doesn't look like that).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/m7h7aw/taking_the_plunge/grbkgli/"}, "2214": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "salty_crabs", "Date": 1616044700, "Score": 1, "Body": "Damn!

It doesn't mean you can't do that, but you need to know more about the existing literature and your methodology. \n\nOne of the main issues here is: how are you going to answer that question?\n\nYou probably can't force brands to stop advertising to see if a price war would happen, for example. \n\nAnd, if you find a situation where brands stopped advertising, there a good chance that they stopped advertising for a very good reason. And that reason could also affect the consumers and consumption habits. \n\nFor example, if brands stopped advertising because of the pandemic, can you say that consumption habits changed due to the lack of advertising? Probably those habits changed because of the pandemic, not the lack of advertising. \n\nEven showing that advertising increases sales (something that would be quite \"basic\" for advertising) can a huge challenge. For example, advertising is expected to increase sales, but advertising budget is often calculated based on expected sales. And brands with higher sales have more money to invest in advertising. So, does advertising increase sales or sales increase advertising? Or maybe there is another factor that affects both. For example, the company has a very good management, that knows the importance of advertising and knows how to sell. So, maybe it's good management that is increasing sales, not advertising. \n\nGaps in the advertising literature often exist because of challenges like this.

Decide what your preferences are on both sides of this scale. Ex: Do you like debugging code and/or the abstract idea of algorithms? \n\n- Consider what the people and culture of fields are like.

Simply put, academia and many of the other public and private entities where I am qualified to work in my field (epidemiology) with a PhD are some of the relative few in the US that provide almost universal protection against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. So, for me the sacrifices are most certainly worth it. Plus, with the pandemic, I\u2019ve had the privilege of spending a lot of wonderful time with my partner and my child, as all our respective schools have been remote for the past year. All that time together has been incredibly special (although definitely trying at times), and I\u2019ve placed a very high value (albeit not financial) on that time together. All I\u2019m saying is all PhD experiences have their costs and benefits, but only you are qualified to assess the worth of the process to you.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/ly8tik/was_it_worth_it_in_the_end/grr5ri0/"}, "2608": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sight19", "Date": 1616373696, "Score": 54, "Body": "I did indeed read some papers that made a heroin addiction sound like a sensible thing to do next", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ma4nt4/happy_grading_tas/grrdwlc/"}, "2609": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Useful_Bread_4496", "Date": 1616374724, "Score": 7, "Body": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ma4nt4/happy_grading_tas/grrg00r/"}, "2610": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "CaptainOuzo", "Date": 1616375073, "Score": 21, "Body": "I have a labmate who grades papers at the grad house drinking large quantities of craft beer.

Even though I'm doing PhD in my own country, I had to move to a state where my native language is not spoken. Because of which even I'm struggling too much to make friends, especially with my Co-scholars. They all talk and discuss about things in their native language and I feel like an outsider all the time. They are politely distant and only talk in English when I ask them a question. Rest of the time, they all speak in their native language and I feel left out. Since, I'm an introvert, I don't mind not being talked with too much but still I feel like they don't want to include me in their discussions. Still, I try my best to strike up a conversation if I happen to hear few English words. I'm in my first year of PhD and just because of my environment I get thoughts about quitting. My PhD advisor is an emotionally unavailable man who shows absolutely no concern or try to help me get a university hostel. Whenever I approach my guide, he doesn't even talk, he just wants to know why I've come to his office and then ends the discussion after answering any question that I ask. If I try to explain my issues he doesn't listen and tell me that I'm whining for nothing and says what will happen if I'll start telling you about my issues. He's a psychologist and yet he talks like this and it just makes me laugh and feel intense anger at the same time for his poor listening skills. I feel isolated and misunderstood most of the time. \n\n\nSince you're in your last year, I'd say make few friends outside of your university, hangout with them, try to build up a little bit of social life and finish your PhD instead of quitting as you've already invested 2 years. Since you're in your final year, think about how in a few months your PhD will get over and you'll be able to move back to your home country with a PhD degree and will be able to hangout with your friends and loved ones; think in this way to motivate yourself and keep yourself engaged. Try to include a little bit of exercise in your routine so that your body has enough happiness hormones. \n\nI hope this helps. \ud83d\ude05 Sending you virtual hugs and love. You're not alone.

I didn't have a great idea of what I wanted to do when I started, but my experiences and the mentorship I've received so far have painted a much clearer picture of what a fulfilling career looks like for me.\n\nThe truth is that a PhD is just as stressful as any other job. But just like any other job, if you hate it you can always find something else. My advice would be to pursue admission into a PhD program and if you don't like it or decide that you don't need it to achieve your dreams, quit after your masters. There's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that. It would be best if you have an idea of what sort of research topic you're interested in, but research careers are long and varied. It's unlikely (imo) that you would work on your thesis topic explicitly for your whole career. So choose a program based on how well you think you'll get along with your potential advisor. Lastly, I would advise you to not apply to masters programs because they typically don't offer financial aid. Apply to PhD programs and often, if you don't get in but the committee likes your application, you'll get into their masters program with a more generous financial aid package and they might ask you to reapply after taking some classes.\n\nGood luck!

You should keep in mind what you want.  Getting a PhD really is what you make of it, and it can be less stressful than your prior work.

One advantage of people who leave high-stress professions have is that we get shit done.  I am finishing in three years (I already defended my dissertation) because I set realistic goals, avoided duplicate work (almost all of my class papers were on topics I chose because I could then put the paper into my dissertation), and I was careful about interviewing my adviser and committee members before I put them in those roles.

I am still hopeful that I get something, but business schools are rough.  Business schools are the worst right now.

You will hear every academic who never worked in industry that industry experience is either unimportant or bad. They're full of shit. It has helped me immensely. Not so much for research ideas, but dealing with all the BS of PhDs as a mature adult helps a lot. \n\nI am lucky my department is cool, but the Finance dept at my university is really shitty. They are frequently acting like all their PhDs are losers and act like the sky is falling if you hit a roadbump. Failing a test doesn't feel so bad when you know you can dip for a job at any time.\n\nAlso, don't lose those connections. I have worked winter breaks for my old job and it has helped pay for things. \n\nAs others have said, it's a good idea if you are willing to give up salary and shit load of time. I would've probably said it wasn't a good idea pre-comps, but after passing, I have actually really enjoyed my time. PhD is definitely incredibly challenging, frustrating, and stressful. It is definitely far more challenging than industry, but also a lot more rewarding.\n\nSome things to keep in mind when applying. Try to get some grasp of the department when you interview. Academics are famously aggressive and arrogant while simultaneously being crazy thin skinned. Your experience as a PhD will very much depend on your department. I have had a good time mostly because I have a supportive advisor and a cool department. My friends in the finance department are miserable. We are separated by one floor in the business school.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind going in is that where you start and where you finish will be two different edges of the planet. It's a crazy and convoluted process, but a really good one if you can appreciate it. Hoenstly, just learning the academic research process was partly worth all this effort.\n\nYou will have a lot more \"free time\", but a lot less time because you will constantly be working or thinking about your ideas. I like this but I think many struggle with never being \"off\" so to speak. I also think people miss understand and think they need to be sitting at a desk every hour of the day to get things done. Most of my best ideas have been tipsy at a bar while watching sports or something. \n\nFor me, I am going to teach and do research. I love the university life (though admittedly I don't really like many academics). I also love my students and teaching. However, getting a business PhD also opens a ton of avenues at hedge funds or other businesses. \n\nLife is about building human capital.

(For what it's worth, I learnt to drive after undergrad haha!) So very similar to your situation.\n\nThere were some tough challenges along the way (my plan initially was to go straight into a PhD but that wasn't possible for financial reasons) but I learnt a ton working in industry.\n\nThis is actually quite a normal path and many PhD students do this - work in industry for a few years after undergrad, then start a PhD. A head of department once told me that people who get some work/life experience before their PhD tend to do the best, because they have perspective and work habits that are hard to gain in undergrad alone.\n\nI would consider contacting some professors and ask for opportunities to get involved in environmental science research projects. You could set aside some time each week for this project. Then, once you have co-authorship on a paper or two (probably looking at 6 months to a year of research experience and a good research relationship with that professor), and you know that you really enjoy research, you could apply for PhD programs.\n\nTwo things to consider however:\n\n* I'm not sure how much research experience you have, but sometimes people have an over-idealized view of research and the academic life, so unless you already have a year or so of research experience and know that you enjoy the whole research process, I would focus on getting that first - both to test the waters and also to build up a profile that says, \"I'm interested in research!!\" and get great potential writers for letters of recommendation.\n* The tough one: You need to consider what a career in academia would look like for you and how it aligns with your priorities in life. As you know, academia is **extremely** competitive. If you think you can \"make it,\" you need to ask what makes you different from hundreds of other people in your position who are equally passionate, fully persuaded they can \"make it\" too, and who are prepared to invest many many hours into their career each week, travel internationally, navigate university politics, and so on. A statistics researcher called Rob Hyndman wrote a helpful blog article \"[What to do when the PhD is finished?](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/jobs/)\" which covers some different options to consider (\"the academic route, the semi-academic route and the business route\").\n\nOf course there are other factors to consider as well (e.g. GPA - I am not sure what this was like for you).

You\u2019re not presenting a narrative, you\u2019re presenting an argument in narrative form. Every line should in your statement should help them answer one of these three questions. Personal statements are about mastering the art of the humble brag, i.e. marketing yourself without seeming like you\u2019re marketing yourself.\n\n2) Consider the format - they\u2019re going to skim hundreds of these. The eye typically skims by looking at the first and last line of each paragraph and then jumping to the middle to fill the gaps. Structure your essay so it\u2019s easy to skim (no large blocks of text, separate paragraphs with a space, make sure your first and last sentence are strong). Sometimes it helps to create a separate document and copy/paste the first and last line of each paragraph. If the narrative in the new document makes sense, it will probably be pretty easy to skim. \n\n3) Be specific - spend time on the program and university website. Learn the language they\u2019re using to describe their values and priorities, then incorporate that language into your personal statement. Reference specific projects, opportunities, or classes you are interested in. Do not reference specific professors you want to work with, because you don\u2019t know the internal politics of the department you\u2019re applying for.

This means I'm checking in over email, video chat, or IM at least once a day. I will say this has fostered very strong relationships with my mentors for this project and that's really helped me during isolation.\n\nI've since added a side project for the summer that originally didn't appear to be tightly coupled, but I've managed to turn it into more coupled work. This just started but already my PI has been fairly accessible and eager to work together on tasks where our skill sets are complimentary. Again, this helps me feel more connected and enthusiastic about the work. \n\nCould you connect with another grad student in your lab and see if they'd be willing to work on a small, tightly coupled, side project with you this summer? Maybe something to submit for a short conference paper so there's a clear timeline to help keep things moving? You can learn from them and feel more connected.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mcyccz/first_year_my_mindset_feels_so_wrong/gs6v23c/"}, "3204": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dabeezmane", "Date": 1616692033, "Score": 1, "Body": "did u land that tenure track job yet though?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/mbrzy2/phd_in_my_30s/gs6x766/"}, "3205": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "spaceforcepotato", "Date": 1616692343, "Score": 5, "Body": "Go to career services where you got your bachelors degree.

When deadlines are approaching or something in a study suddenly happens (mice start dying so you have to euthanize them all), the hours get a little longer. I have heard that some startups expect longer hours just due to the nature of being a small startup but other startups say they embrace work/life balance. The time frames for most projects are usually move as fast as possible. Part of this is because you want your product out before the competition get's their similar product out and the longer you take the more likely it is that you have competition. From what I have seen, it usually takes a project at least 2 years to make it's way out of early R&amp;D and move on to the next step within the company.

We spent many hours in a tiny office so we wound up talking about random often way out stuff.

So, you trying different things and seeing they are not for you is part of the process. \n\n2 - Knowing yourself is a very important part of the process too. The more you know yourself, the more you can focus on trying things that have a good chance of working for you. \n\n3 - If you love something, you love both the good and the bad parts of it. You don't need love to like the good parts of something. It seems to me that you think about the good parts (and then it's easy to think you love it), but then gets disappointed when you need to face the bad parts.\n\n4 - This may be an unpopular opinion. But I think that, if you really love learning something, that love should motivate you to also practice that. As people say, there is nothing more practical than a good theory. But can't expect to learn that without practice. There is usually a limit of what you can learn without practice.

So he told me he would be happy to take me into his CDT and will look for funding for me. On my side I applied for funding from somewhere else but failed. We decided to put a formal phd application to uni and he confirmed to me that he might be getting some funding for me.

He's known me since my first year of undergrad (close to 6 years now), I worked under him for the last two years (masters), and I'm continuing under him for my PhD, and he's the sort of supervisor who cares about his students, which is why his advice weighs a lot (?my expression might be poor here - sorry if so) to me. \n\nHis one advice about doing a PhD is, only do it if you can't see yourself doing anything but research. I think one of the comments under this post says the same - if what you want to do in a future requires you to have a PhD and you *really, REALLY* want to do that, then a PhD it is. \n\nMy closest friends are currently all job-hunting, and I'm here writing grant applications, and wow, let me say, the feeling of insecurity is real. They're gonna start their careers while I work in the lab for the next 3 years when I could be working as well, etc. But at the end of the day, we all have our reasons and priorities for choosing what we want to do, and for me, I want to be a researcher, and for them, they don't know what they want to /do/ per se, but they know its not research. And that's fair.\n\nI don't know what's a good reason to do a PhD, but I always think to myself that if I get sick of research during my PhD (hopefully not but gotta think about these things), then I'll quit and get a job elsewhere, and it's something that does happen sometimes.\n\nBest of luck, OP! It's a hard decision, and it's always impossible to tell if it's the 'right' one - depending on your definition of 'right'.\n\n\n\nPS said supervisor sent me a gif the day I got my acceptance letter to the doctoral program, which was a Princess Peach in a lava dungeon, with the text, 'Welcome to hell.' :) \n\nPPS, the same time he sent that, I sent the message, 'welps, there goes my soul for the next three years huh?' :)", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/memv1k/why_a_phd/gsk79gl/"}, "3488": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "aklion", "Date": 1616916810, "Score": 1, "Body": "Im no doctor in anyway shape or form but a little bit of doubt is good keeps you from thinking you know it all and makes you think more soundly on decisions", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/mewqnf/am_i_deserve_to_be_a_doctor/gsk7wpd/"}, "3489": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Neurotic_Z", "Date": 1616919431, "Score": 10, "Body": "Thank you.

Many supervisors offer lab tours / interaction opportunities with other lab members even before the beginning of the PhD, to prospective PhD students.

My PhD will be in Computer Science, but I'm focused on theory. I can see what my colleagues that work in labs do, and they are definitely more stressed than me. If the theory doesn't work, I either invent a new theory or I argue why the previous theory was wrong. \n\nThis compared to people who work in, for instance, the high performance computing lab, who if their results don't show what they're expected to show, that might be an indication of a major problem. Also, they can't just go on a multi-week vacation and work remotely, since they always need to be nearby to address problems in the lab. Here in NL, we had a few weeks in Feb where the buildings were closed due to inclement weather, and those who needed to get into the lab were truly panicking. Several had deadlines that they were able to barely meet because of that.\n\nAt the same time, I also know a few PhD candidates in the states and even in the more theory fields are always stressed. The work might not be directly stressful, but there's a shitton of other stressors to deal with. The biggest disadvantage of theory work is that it's often the hardest to get funding to do. And in the US where securing funding is like half the battle of a PhD, this can lead to a shitton of stress.\n\nMeanwhile in some EU countries, PhDs are paid positions. So even if I'm working on theory, I don't have to deal with money stress. It's the same for most of the theory PhDs at my university. For me, this job is just that, a job. The difference between being a PhD Candidate and working in industry is, \n\n1. I'm more motivated to get stuff done, since I'm not just working for a salary, but I'm working for my own benefit. Publishing is good for my department and university, but it's also directly good for me. Compared to workign in industry, where I only work because I'm being paid to do it.\n\n2. I get paid less. This is to be expected, they will eventually give me a PhD if I keep performing my job. The side effect is that they get to pay me less. \n\n3. I'm more of a captive in this job. In industry, if the job sucks, I'd just leave. I've done this in the past as well. But here, I'm invested in finishing my PhD, so even if the culture was toxic, I'd probably stick it out. This last point is why I think a lot of PhDs suffer, because they're basically held captive. Even at my university, some institutes have a culture problem, and those PhDs are really struggling.

As a job\n\nThe problem is that for many, doing a PhD as a job isn't an option. Either you're not getting stable funding from it, or the money you do get is too little.  \n\nBut I've worked jobs with companies that I thought weren't particularly exciting. But I was there to do a job, so I did my job and got paid.\n\nWith my PhD, I kind of think the same way. I'm here to do a job, and in compensation, I get a salary and eventually a PhD. Sometimes the job is really interesting and I enjoy it a lot, sometimes the job sucks. That's generally how jobs work. But I'm luckily in a position where my salary pays for everything I need it to pay for, and so I'm fine working a job that sometimes sucks.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say that you'll definitely hate the job if you aren't obsessed with it. Not everyone loves their job, that's a pretty big luxury.
