Is it an external source like a supervisor? Or does it only come from you? If there are things that people other than your internal critic feel you need to improve, the best way to go about it is to be specific and targeted. (Rather than \u201cI need to be better at this PhD,\u201d it should be \u201cI would like to strength my knowledge of this specific research method\u201d or whatever the area for improvement is, and the way to address that needs to be specific and appropriate. \u201cBy taking this specific seminar\u201d rather than \u201cby researching 24/7.\u201d)\nIf your doubts come only from you, it might help to prepare a script for yourself that you use to argue with yourself when you\u2019re at your lowest. When I feel like a failure or like I\u2019m not good enough, I have a list that I run through in my head of the successes I\u2019ve had while in the PhD (no matter how small) and my supervisors\u2019 or cohorts\u2019 feelings about my work, and that helps remind me that I\u2019m focusing only on the negatives and that my current perception doesn\u2019t line up with reality.\n\n2) Working constantly actually makes us less effective. You\u2019re constantly stressed and you have no time away from your work, which prevents you from being able to get the distance from your research that you need in order to come up with fresh insights. (Research on creativity suggests that we often come up with solutions to problems when we step away from them and do something else\u2014our brains need time to be disengaged in order to function at their best.) Obviously fieldwork can make it tricky, but it\u2019s important to take regular days away from your PhD in order to allow you to function at your best. It\u2019s very easy to get caught up in meeting deadlines, and pushing yourself really hard to meet a certain deadline and not taking the breaks you need... but after that deadline, there will be another deadline and another and another. To be cliche, it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint, and you can do real emotional and physical damage to yourself by trying to sprint for the entire PhD marathon. For me, when I feel really overwhelmed, terrible about my work product, exhausted, and unexcited about the PhD, it\u2019s usually a sign that I urgently need to take days off. It\u2019s not lazy or a sign that you\u2019re not committed enough or working hard enough\u2014it\u2019s absolutely necessary to protect your ability to continue doing the PhD long term.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/coodof/nothing_is_ever_good_enough/ewkcpfi/"}, "599": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "HungoverHippy42", "Date": 1565482564, "Score": 4, "Body": "Call your mom.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/coodof/nothing_is_ever_good_enough/ewkeu4s/"}, "600": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dxmactw", "Date": 1565483353, "Score": 1, "Body": "So true.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/codjaw/we_put_much_more_effort_in_this_relationship/ewkfy1s/"}, "601": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Swirlingstar", "Date": 1565496692, "Score": 2, "Body": "I once got a 'k'.

I worked in my home country for 2 years and spent 1 year living and working in Japan which really broadened my horizon.\n\nFor many of the hard science folks, the PhD is simply a stepping stone to something greater. For me, the PhD is the goal in itself. Besides, I'm a literature student so outside of academia very few people are going to care about what I've written, but *I* care, you know? It's a very personal project for me, and I am very motivated. I'm probably going to try to stay in academia after my PhD, but if I have to do something else and not really \"use\" the PhD then that'd be totally fine. I will still have written the book I wanted to write and won't have to wonder \"What if?\"\n\nAcademia is full of rejection and (feelings of) failure and inadequacy unfortunately. \n\n&gt;I just got my master\u2019s degree 6 weeks  ago and I want to do a PhD too. No one asked me to do it, or said that I  would be suitable, but I just really want to do it. I have told a few  supervisors/professors and no one has told me that I shouldn\u2019t do it, so  I guess that\u2019s an okay sign?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  just keep doubting myself because I was a shit undergrad and only got my  shit together during my master\u2019s (I have ADD and come from a working  class family).\n\nWhat field are you in? I'm also Danish (your name tipped me off) and nobody is going to care about your BA at all. I got a 12 (highest possible) for my MA thesis and that probably helped but beyond that my diploma, I think, wasn't a big deal. In most fields nobody is going to actively tell you to do a PhD, at least in Denmark. There's just so much competition and no money. I'm also from a working class family; in fact, I'm the first one in my entire family to even graduate high school (STX) so the mere idea of a PhD is so foreign to my family that it's not even funny. They're proud but have no idea what I do. \n\nFigure out *why* you want to do a PhD and then you have to learn not to give a fuck about many things.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cnutl4/remembering_that_feeling_when_you_got_into_your/ewmalig/"}, "657": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ninasvanebruhn", "Date": 1565547097, "Score": 1, "Body": "You are definitely not the worst!

I recently completed a PhD in music ed last spring. Actually, /u/ra42890 and I actually attended the same university (this world is VERY small). Before starting my degree program, I taught string orchestra grades 6-12. This fall I will be starting my first full-time professor position.\n\n**What has your experience been like?** Oh where to begin! Ironically enough, as a school orchestra teacher I was extremely type A. Every since this particular program I've been more type B...or type B+. Despite having to be on top of reading, writing, presenting, etc, I've learned to just calm down because everything will work out. Additionally, I have developed a network of colleagues and friends nation wide.\n\n**How has the PhD helped you as an artist?** As you know, our art in music education revolves around working with people. Yes, we make music, but as music teachers/conductors/directors we work with people in order in order to create a musical product. We hope to inspire, motivate, and instill a sense of independence musicianship. This program taught me how to work with people. Look at specific behaviors in others and figure out how I can change my own behaviors to help raise their own level of musicianship...therefore elevating my own musicianship.\n\n**Or have you felt so lost in the research that you feel like you never have time for your craft?** Absolutely! But, I also found a lot of research to support what I already do in my craft \u2013 which is great to cite in workshops and presentations. Research should not be consider a burden. Sure, it is daunting and scary, but that is only because it is typically new and unknown. It's like starting class piano as an undergrad. You're scared of it and probably don't want to do it, mostly because it is probably unfamiliar and you have to work hard at it, but having basic piano skills is a must for all music teachers. Through my own experiences and having conversations with experienced colleagues (whether they're junior or senior level faculty), their research only guides and improves their craft.\n\n**Any advice?** I'll give you three pieces of advice that has stuck with me, all from senior level faculty members. There is a lot more, but these three stuck with me the most.\n\n1. Consider your program and assistantship (and I hope you have one) as \"student teaching\" to become a professor. Not only do you have to be a student, but you have to work on becoming a colleague. This means teaching, writing, presenting, and networking. If you view your projects for each class as a potential publishable piece of work, then you are on the right track.\n2. This program is not just about regurgitating information that is already out there. It is about learning how to *create new information*. You are improving or creating new pedagogical techniques. You are researching new ideas, reinforcing or even arguing current published ideas. You are using research to systematically investigate pedagogical techniques that have been used by music teachers everywhere, providing evidence on is effectiveness or ineffectiveness. For your undergraduate degree, and to a certain extent your masters degree, you read and you learned other people's ideas. For this degree, you create those ideas.\n3. When you complete your undergraduate music education degree, you are given keys to the students. You are given power to teach students how to create music as defined by whatever standards you want to have. When you complete your terminal degree in music education, you are now the giver of keys. You have the responsibility to make sure that the undergraduates you teach are competent and trustworthy enough to work with younger students. The implications of this responsibility is far-reaching and wide.\n\nOkay, that is all for now. But I'd be more than happy to delve further and answer more questions if you'd like. Just send me a PM.

As it usually goes, however, the experiment ended up not being very straightforward whatsoever. \n\nTo put that into context, there are certain complexes of Ruthenium (Ru 2+) that intercalate into DNA and luminesce (the luminescence gets quenched without DNA via hydrogen bonding interactions between certain ligands and water).

The guy running it suggested working for two \"golden hours\" every morning, with absolutely no distractions - no phone, no coffee making, even avoid pee breaks if you can. Then do whatever you want for the rest of the day. Keep working on 'easier' tasks while listening to music or watching Netflix, take coffee breaks when you need them, have a nap if you need to. The idea being that 2 hours of really productive work when you're awake and ready to go is better than a whole day's worth of 'distracted' work.

I also have a chronic illness to manage alongside having an adult life with house, cat, bills, chores.\n\nI often feel like I'm not doing enough, because I'm deliberately not working evenings and weekends. I see friends saying \"Oh, I don't work late, I stop at 8pm\". I wouldn't work after 5pm and I mostly stop earlier than that. I've passed every one of my panels and my supervisors are happy with my work.\n\nI'm starting to think that this tendency to work very long hours is more about anxiety around doing enough, being good enough, and a feeling that somehow working all the hours will compensate from a thought that our work isn't good enough.\n\nBut in your viva, you will not be asked how many hours you worked (unless your work is seriously substandard). You won't get a PhD on the basis that you worked every single hour you were conscious.\n\nWe do better work when we take frequent breaks. PhDs even in sciences require time to think up solutions, connections, and all that is intense creative work. A lot of my PhD time is spent going on walks to think about a problem I have. That counts as work.\n\nI'm on schedule to finish on time, with 33k of a 60k thesis written and entering my third year. I don't do weekends, I don't do late nights even when I'm in a writing phase.

I'm in a composition program (ABD) in a large city, and it has not been a good experience. I went in without any funding (an incredibly foolish idea) because it's a state school and I figured I could pay my way until I got a teaching position and tuition coverage. The year after I entered, all students received automatic funding and a teaching position, and none of this was retroactive. The result was that I was unable to secure a teaching position at all because the available positions went to people with the funding. I did try to apply to other schools, but getting a position without any teaching experience is a challenge and was not fruitful for me. A couple years into the program I lost a steady job and it took years to get back on my feet. I now work full time and am doing research at a crawl. I have zero expectations that my degree is going to be helpful in the job market (I no longer want to go into academia), so this whole part of my life feels like a giant waste. I'm only trying to finish at this point because I've put in so much time and money, I'd like something to show for it.\n\nWhile I'm a bit grumpy, I will note that all of my music education friends are successful and happy. Composition friends, however, are a VERY mixed bag haha.\n\nSo, I don't feel like the PhD has helped me as an artist. I did my best music work in my masters program honestly and everything after has been a struggle. On the other hand, I've met some amazing people and organizations that I probably wouldn't have run into otherwise, and my job, while not directly in academia, came because of connections in my PhD program. Yes, between classes (that weren't very suited for composers on the whole) and work, I felt like I had very little time to practice my craft, and I barely compose these days. I do practice an instrument regularly, though.\n\nI blew through the coursework in two years, but I got held up by a foreign language exam. We were required to pass two language exams (translate scholarly music articles into English), one of which had to be German, and the test could only be taken once a semester. I struggled with German for many semesters (and couldn't get any dissertation approval until it was complete)... then forgot everything about it once I passed. Some program requirements are terribly silly.\n\nMy advice: FUNDING. Hopefully you're receiving that and didn't accept admission without it. The next part is remembering that things don't have to be perfect, they just have to be good enough, and sometimes it's ok to do the bare minimum because you are going to be presented with many tasks, and a good number of them will seem pointless in relation to your interests or career goals. And if you get bogged down with the dissertation, remember that it's a genre and you're trying to prove your understanding of that genre.\n\nHope this helps some, and good luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cox91n/phd_in_the_arts/ewru9eq/"}, "752": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "titian834", "Date": 1565715043, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thanks needed that.

I am a registered disabled student with long term mental health problems. Initially, my supervisor didn't really 'get' having mental health issues, but over the course of working with her for my Masters thesis, I became confident that she was the right person for me.\n\nShe has been nothing but supportive. I've had a number of issues come up, including being severely depressed at the beginning of this year. Because I am honest with her, she has a good sense of what kind of support I need. Part of this may be because I've always consistently produced good work and aim to do my best, even if my best on any particular day isn't that awesome.\n\nMy illness this year has been so harsh I also let our PGR support advisor know, and my whole panel has been incredibly supportive. We have discussed strategies for healthcare management in panels, and this openness has made it much easier to work because I don't have the anxiety of being afraid people will find out.\n\nI suspect a lot of responses to this will be that you shouldn't discuss mental health issues with anybody, because there is a lingering stigma over it. It is considered to be a weakness, and a lot of PhD students worry that their supervisors will view them as not being strong enough to do a PhD, that they should be able to tough it out. I suspect that might be a bigger issue in countries other than the UK. I've found the environment in my department to be nothing but supportive.\n\nI tend to think that being open and honest is the best way forward. If you're already depressed, it's only going to get worse if you add the terror of what might happen if you can't work, and can't give an honest account of why you're not getting work done. I think each case is different, and will depend on the attitude of your supervisor toward mental health issues.\n\nOne of the things that can happen if you do discuss these issues with your supervisor is that it deepens the relationship, and that can be really helpful for progressing in academia. When it's not kept secret, when you're not constantly putting on a front, the relationships you develop have an added depth. The advice and support you get are better, tailored better to your own needs. Supervisors often have great strategies for managing difficult periods.\n\nI may be insanely lucky - I've already got a PhD and I've found ways to make sure my work is of a high enough standard throughout the last two years - but I'm incredibly grateful to my supervisor for all her support and guidance.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cq70dg/do_you_talk_to_your_supervisor_about_how_youre/ewudis1/"}, "792": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "search4life7", "Date": 1565778440, "Score": 2, "Body": "all but dissertation!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cpy7sp/2_week_comps/ewuf2vl/"}, "793": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "search4life7", "Date": 1565778476, "Score": 1, "Body": "comprehensive exam, a really intensive test you have to pass before beginning your dissertation", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cpy7sp/2_week_comps/ewuf3wh/"}, "794": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "little_cotton_socks", "Date": 1565778863, "Score": 6, "Body": "I worked up the courage to tell mine and it was the best decision I could have made.

Plan it ahead and ask your supervisor for plenty time to talk and discuss. It is essential for your supervisor to know how to guide and advise you in situations where you get anxious and act illogical when needed to think with precision. Communicating this will let your supervisor understand when you skip deadlines or need some rest/time off. It is essential for that person to know who he/she is working with. In a best case scenario both of you want the best to come out of the time you spent on a project.\n\nMy advice is to not involve other people who are at a higher hierarchy to your supervisor in such a setting. This might cause complications. In my case, this was a huge mistake. My supervisor really doesn\u2019t know what actually happened to me until much later/now, since it was communicated by a third person. I made a mistake my frantically calling the wrong person for help when I was having a panic attack.\n\nBefore the meeting write down what you wanted to talk and follow that. This will make sure that you don\u2019t lose your course while you speak... assuming this happens a lot when we are mentally suffering. Making a list will also help you addressing all issues you would want to convey.... even if you are intimidated by a much knowledgeable person.\n\nConsult a therapist. Do not let your university or lab make restrictions to what you can do and where you can go just because you are undergoing therapy. In my case, I was asked to get a wellness certificate from my therapist in order to work in my lab. I was isolated and placed in a room which I didn\u2019t share with my colleagues. This effected me and put me in a much worse situation. I was turning mad every day trying to act all sane with the therapist to get a wellness certificate to enter my lab such that I could work on my favourite subject.

What this does is set nearer term goals for you and if you get done early you can reward yourself with an evening off. \n\nCoupled with this I would suggest marking some time during the week that is never PhD time. eg. 2 hours on a Tuesday evening is for x activity no matter what happens you need that non work space to function as a person. Usually afterwards your work quality will improve.\n\nI would also suggest you just message your friends and tell them how stressed you are and that's why you're unavailable, they'll understand.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/cqnxhy/massive_stress_near_the_finish_line_feel_like_a/ewxwypw/"}, "852": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Durkamer", "Date": 1565870738, "Score": 3, "Body": "I just went this through this with my submission in July.

Yes, it is stressful but being able to control your time fully is an advantage. It\u2019s rare for people who are otherwise on top of their data to not finish. So, you\u2019ll get there and you\u2019ll never feel like you\u2019re getting there until the day you submit.\n\nThe next thing is to write out a daily schedule that gets you to finish a week ahead of schedule (with time for re-reading/edits). By doing this, you will have a set plan every day and you will show your self that it is feasible. When you accomplish your daily tasks, you will not feel guilty about rewarding yourself with personal time. You will also keep yourself on task so that in case you do fall behind, you know exactly what is needed for later.\n\nFinally, I found myself in low productivity rut almost every day. Instead of trying to work through them, and spending a few hours getting little work done while also anxious about it, go for a quick walk, coffee with a friend, watch an episode of your favorite show, or call up your family.

Work in 25 min intervals (pomodoros) with short 5 min breaks after each one and a longer 15 min break after 3-4x 25 min intervals. You can use your own timer, or you can find one here: [https://pomodoro-tracker.com/](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/). Make sure that before you start your 25 min timer, you eliminate any distractions, e.g. put your phone somewhere not visible, clear out all distracting tabs on your browser. You'll find that once you start your first pomodoro, it gets easier to get into the work you need to do.\n* Break down the things you need to do to get your presentation done into very very small attainable tasks. Write them down, check them off as you go. E.g. make title slide, make graph for x experiment, write description for this slide, analyze x data, put analysis in slide, compile images needed for slides, etc. You can even assign each task to a pomodoro.\n* A lot of the time, our procrastination arises from fear of failure or fear that our end result will not be perfect. As they say, perfect is the enemy of good/done. It's better to have something done than to have an incomplete presentation. And once you have a complete presentation to work with, you can always make it better if you have time/energy.\n\nBest of luck with your presentation!

I do not believe that paying full price for a PsyD is a reasonable investment.\n\nI will add also that forensic psych is a *super* competitive specialization where someone (the opposing lawyer) has an interest in shredding your credentials if there is any way to do so. Because many PsyD programs are perceived as having much shakier training, PsyD graduates are often less desired for positions that are, frankly, difficult to get.\n\nAs others have noted, the norm for a PhD is that your tuition, fees, and health insurance are paid for, and you receive a stipend for your work. There are some fully funded PsyDs, but not many, and they tend to look a lot like PhD programs. \n\n(Also, this is super nitpicky, but *probably* your wife is looking at a PsyD in clinical psych with a forensic track or maybe a PsyD in clinical forensic psych. I would double check with her! It's important because the routes to becoming a licensed psychologist are clinical, counseling, or school psych which means she would realistically want to look at clinical and maybe counseling psych, even if they do not specifically have a forensic specialization. I am a PhD student in counseling psych and know people going the forensic route even though our program does not have that particular specialization-- they have just set up their externships/classes/research to facilitate this.

Make sure you have friends and do things with said friends that are not involved in your program at all. You need interactions with people who you can't talk to about your research. You need friends who will be shoulders to lean on. And most importantly you need an escape from everything, even if it's for a short time. \n\n5. Find some time to do something. Play board games, listen to new music, go bar hopping, watch some sports, get a hobby, or just do whatever makes you happy. But do it, every week.\n\n6.
