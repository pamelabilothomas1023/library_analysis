If you do go this route, some things to know. (1) You will probably be surrounded by a lot of cynical, jaded people.

I also try to make my teaching as accessible and \u201cfun\u201d as possible, because getting my students jazzed about psych is the only thing that gives me the energy to look at 500ms reading time differences, all day, every day. (2) remember that grad school will be your job, not your personality. Yes, it will take up more time and mental energy than any 9-5 you\u2019ll find. But aforementioned cynical folk like to take pride in working 18 hours a day, getting no sleep, putting research before all else. *Don\u2019t be that guy.* Schedule breaks into your week where you don\u2019t check your email, don\u2019t think about your work, even if it\u2019s just for a Sunday or an evening midweek.

(This is especially important in the humanities and social sciences.)\n\nWhat makes a PhD/academia worthwhile really depends on how much you enjoy conducting research in your field. And, unfortunately, it's very difficult to know this ahead of time, given the relative uniqueness of the work required. I'll list some traits that tend to correlate with enjoying graduate studies and an academic career:\n\n1. Endless curiousity. This is, hands down, the most important thing to possess. It helps you stay motivated, overcome failures, and be creative.\n\n2. Enjoy reading and writing. You're gonna be doing these things more than any person ought to be, so you'd best love doing them. You need to be highly skilled at both to get publications and effectively display the fruits of your curiousity (research efforts).\n\n3. Comfortable working odd/long hours and in isolation. Whether you're in a neuroscience lab or writing a humanities dissertation, you're going to be spending a lot of time working alone on things that require your full concentration. And, since there are no set hours and workloads are variable, you're going to be working at strange times, holidays, and so on.\n\n4. Confident. Impostor syndrome is a real thing that everyone experiences; you have to be able to overcome it. The best way is to show confidence through your research, whether it's writing, analyzing, reporting, interviewing, presenting, and so on. Over time, you start to believe in that confidence you've portrayed---especially as you reach milestones, like your first first-author publication, or being published in a prestigious journal. Tangential to this is being able to advocate for yourself to attract potential advisors, job offers, go for large research grants, establish connections, and interview well.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to possess these (and more) and happen to get lucky with uncontrollable factors, you may get through a PhD and into academia relatively unscathed.\n\nAlso, all of these are easier to have if you've made the most of your prior schooling. Having research experience, co-op placements, applying for scholarships/research grants, pursuing a thesis advisor and applying for research opportunities, and so on all raise your chances of knowing beforehand if you're suited for a PhD and help develop the skills necessary to enjoy the experience. Ultimately, taking charge of your learning is much easier if you've gotten the chance to do so during your undergraduate studies, where exploring your options is a much safer endeavour than in graduate school. The stakes are much lower, and no one expects perfection from you in undergrad. But, obviously, these things aren't formally taught to undergraduates, which is partly why there are so many people in graduate programs that are unsuited for what they're doing. (There are also plenty of people who believe they need graduate education to succeed in finding a good job, but that's a rant for another day.) It's not surprising that many of the people who successfully complete their PhD have at least one parent who has similarly completed one.\n\nTl;dr: A PhD/academia can be quite rewarding if you're suited for the work required, and impossibly miserable if you're not. It's hard to know ahead of time, but taking advantage of opportunities in undergraduate studies can help you make an informed decision about graduate studies.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/obmgti/im_an_undergrad_student_planning_to_get_a_phd_and/h3rqucc/"}, "239": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sincere_eel", "Date": 1625202187, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you, this is a great response!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/obmgti/im_an_undergrad_student_planning_to_get_a_phd_and/h3rqzdp/"}, "240": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Mobile-Escape", "Date": 1625202319, "Score": 2, "Body": "You're welcome.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/obmgti/im_an_undergrad_student_planning_to_get_a_phd_and/h3rr6by/"}, "241": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "tikki2021", "Date": 1625204346, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you for your advice!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/obb79x/phd_application_advice/h3ru464/"}, "242": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "tikki2021", "Date": 1625204352, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you for your advice!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/obb79x/phd_application_advice/h3ru4gm/"}, "243": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Marionberry_Real", "Date": 1625204503, "Score": 1, "Body": "I\u2019m working on a PhD in an R1 medical school and we get our tuition paid every semester.

Relax yourself and pamper yourself because you deserve it after all this hard work.\n3. Make sure to eat a hearty meal and get some sleep.\n4. If you have trouble sleeping google the 4 7 8 technique and try it. Even if you don't fall asleep it will help your anxiety. Even a few hours of sleep can make a difference so at least try to sleep.\n5. Make sure that you eat a nutritious meal before your defence. \n\nDon't let that voice in your head steal your peace of mind.

I also use the FocusMate, which pairs you randomly w another user at a time of your choosing.

One idea that could help for topic-related motivation and/or feedback is to contact someone else doing similar research. You could find authors of papers on similar topics and email them a question or two about their methods or something, and then someone might be willing to answer more questions. \n2. Have you talked to your advisor about these challenges? Is there any sort of compromise they\u2019ll make, like them reading more about your topic so they can ask questions? Or if they\u2019ll commit to longer meetings w you, you can talk to them more about the topic during meetings and explain what your working on. Sometimes talking it out can untangle problems in your own head, even if the other person doesn\u2019t have answers.  \n3. Have you considered talking to your university about a different advisor (possibility of switching may depend on country)? Someone more committed might offer an improvement even if they\u2019re further from your research topic, considering your current one isn\u2019t knowledgeable or committed. \n4.

I was blessed to have been in a pipeline to PhD program for marginalized students so I didn't pay any of the application fees, they were waived for me. \n\nAdditional costs include:\n- GRE(general exam): $210 per exam + $27 per recipient (school/program) though you get up to 4 free recipients to send to. If you applied to more than 4 programs like I did, any program that requires GRE scores, you'll be paying the $27 fee, per program to send the scores\n\n- Tuition: varies; all the programs I got accepted to had different approaches to tuition. Some programs will pay a portion or percentage of your tuition (ex. 90% of tuition) leaving the rest for the student to pay out of pocket, if they choose to go there. Some programs will fully pay your tuition, upon the condition that students serve as either a Research Assistant (RA) or a Teacher's Assistant (TA) for either all or a portion of time while in the program. Some programs may pay your full tuition for a portion of the time you're in the program, upon the condition you serve as a RA or TA for a portion of the time in the program. For example in my program, I am offered full tuition being paid, every year for 5 or 6 years, but I have to serve as a TA for 2-3 years.\n\n- Student Fees: varies; some programs will pay all student fees, a portion, or none (leaving the fees to be paid fully by the student). For example, I have a friend who's going into her 3rd year, and she's had to pay for her student fees from her stipend that she gets from the department, in order to stay enrolled. One of the programs that offered me acceptance, offered to pay a percentage (around 80%) of the student fees. The program I am starting soon, is offering to pay all student fees, every year for up to 5-6 years. Also, in-state vs. out-of-state tuition matters for graduate students. I will be an out-of-state student, therefore the tuition and fees will be higher. That being said, most programs that offer to pay for fees and tuition have a clause stating that the out-of-state tuition and fees will be paid for the first year, but will only be paid in subsequent years if the graduate student aquires in-state residency (which typically takes about 1 full year to become officially a resident of a state). My program is like this.\n\n- Health Insurance: varies: same as the other components above, some programs pay all insurance, some, or none. I have a friend who has to spend money from her stipend, from the department, on health insurance offered by the University. My program is fully paying for health insurance (the full payment of everything is partially why I accepted the offer to go where I'm going). There are additional components to health insurance because each school and department has different health insurance plans. For example, back to my friend who pays fees out of pocket, the health insurance plan covers mainly medical and maybe some dental. For my program, they pay for insurance covering medical, dental, mental health, and vision. So each department/program and school is different in the U.S. Like at the school where my friend is, she's in a psychology PhD program. I've heard how the PhD students in the STEM field get higher stipends, and more of their fees and insurance paid for, vs. those in the social sciences and humanities. \n\nTraveling/Conferences: Varies; this greatly varies by field, department, and school. Some schools have funds that students can apply for. Some programs have funds that each student is eligible for, to cover traveling expenses to conferences. Conferences are helpful for networking and showing off your research, helping on the later job-market. \n\nThat's about all I can think of for right now. Hopefully this helps answer your question. If I think of anything else, I'll add it, but yeah. Lot of variation in the U.S. and a lot of gatekeeping as a result of the cost. I was told if I have to pay anything to go to a program, I shouldn't even go. Thankfully, I had that choice. But many do not. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: Stipends: varies; this greatly varies by program/department. Some pay less than 20k ($20,000), some pay 30k or more. One program offered me around 40k to start, and it would increase around 8-10k per year. Which sounds really great. Here's the catch, the school is in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. I have a friend who knows someone in that city who's a PhD student in STEM getting 50-60k per year from his department, and yet this dude is still struggling to make ends meet. So stipends vary greatly, especially when the pandemic was at its peak (many programs didn't even have an app cycle last year due to the pandemic and cuts in funding). Stipends are tricky because if a program offers a lot, it could be because living in the city is hella expensive. Or vice versa, for example one program I got accepted to had a stipend around $30k, which sounds pretty low, but the school is located in a low populated area. So the PhD students there are able to get mortgages for houses dirt cheap(around 300-500 a month) by themselves. So this is the PhD financial portion that is probably most impacted by location.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/obqb4n/today_i_reenrolled_for_the_final_time_in_my_phd/h3t77e6/"}, "325": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MusicologyMaven", "Date": 1625237638, "Score": 3, "Body": "You\u2019ve run the race; the defense is the victory lap.

I am still teaching and have recently been given a promotion in one job and another short term contract job (both at uni) but even though it's been more than two years since the faculty started screwing me over and almost two years since I was forced to discontinue, I'm still bitter and angry about how badly they treated me, and I genuinely can't understand how they a) could have messed so many things up so badly and b) struggled so much to actually fix any of the problems they caused. I know it isn't healthy (and yes I have actually tried seeing a psychologist about it but unfortunately I'm the sort of person who can talk about problems til they're blue in the face but unless the problems causing the anxiety/depression are actually fixed, then talking about 'feelings' etc doesn't actually solve anything). One thing I also find funny (well, sad, but not really surprising) is how many of the faculty were like \"Oh, we'll keep in touch and check on you, see how you're doing\" after I'd discontinued and then I have literally heard from no one since the start of last year (and yes, I know, covid and all that, but still).\n\n*---feel free to skip the rest of my post if you want since it's mostly a rant, but it may resonate with some others who are in a similar position and aren't sure whether they should leave or try to stick it out---*\n\nTechnically I could go back and finish my PhD within 4 years of discontinuing and there's a part of me that still wants to do that (because I hate failing, even when there's nothing I could have done about it), but there are three main reasons why I probably never will:\n\na) I just don't care about the project anymore. When I started I was emotionally invested and engaged and really wanted to make a difference to society/help people while doing something I loved. The issues I faced over the years in my PhD and the way the faculty treated me in my final year have beaten that out of me.\n\nb) The project will never benefit me or anyone else. My project is essentially a proof of concept, but for the system to be useful/marketable on a wide scale, it would still need further refinements after the completion of my PhD and again, I've had enough and don't want to deal with it anymore. I would also have to write papers before finishing the PhD (as it's expected you have a few publications) but again, because of the issues I faced, I didn't really get any data until early in my final year, so I'd have to write three quickly (and honestly I lack the mental energy to finish the thesis itself let alone a bunch of journal articles). So even if I finished the PhD, the fact it took me so long and not having any publications would mean that my career prospects in academia for the long term would be very poor.\n\nc) I genuinely don't believe I would be allowed to finish the project. My main issue is with my data collection, which even though my supervisor said it was fine and I had enough, I'm worried that if I go through all the work of doing the analysis\\*, writing it up and submitting my thesis, the examiners could turn around and say I need to collect more data. This would require having to set up the system again and get technology resources, which would mean having to rely on the faculty for support and resources (eg. setting up a location for conducting the data gathering). I know from experience that they will not only not give me this support/resources (or if they do they'll drag it out and take so long that by the time they do it, it's too late), they will actually screw things up and make things worse. Again, I don't have the mental or emotional energy to put myself through that again.\n\n\\*The analysis would be another challenge because even though I went to a course run by the university for the kind of analysis I need to do, it was a complete waste of time.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/nzq9r8/leaving_phd_in_third_year/h3vlvi3/"}, "457": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Zweidalos", "Date": 1625277969, "Score": 3, "Body": "Most of the time, when I start feeling worn out and tired of the academia I just remember that I might not be able to do anything else.

I finished my PhD this May in the field of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. I can share some of my experience with you.\n\nI can wholeheartedly say that my PhD was the most challenging albeit most enjoyable years of my life thus far. The challenging parts may not be as relevant to you - I live/work abroad, far away from my family, so this part is particularly difficult for me. On the upside, my fianc\u00e9 and his family are here and are incredibly supportive, so I did not feel completely isolated.\n\nThe other challenging aspect was the lack of a supportive/collegial PhD cohort in my dept. Don't get me wrong; I made at least two excellent friends during my journey, and some very nice acquaintances, but most of the time I felt very much working on my own. This was further intensified by COVID, but the lack of PhD network existed even when we were sharing an office. In fact, when we had a physical workspace, I unfortunately had some very unpleasant incidents with one senior PhD student who, for some odd reason, would move my belongings (and/or damage them). Generally speaking, the dept was less innovative when it came to supporting PhD students, and there is no real post-doc culture in the faculty. Most initiatives and developments rested on us, which was frustrating.\n\nSo, as a consequence of that, I worked my ASS off. There was not a single year where I did not do something BESIDES my full-time PhD, and, perhaps masochistically so, I enjoyed it. I worked as a Research Assistant, Graduate Teaching Assistant, Research Officer, Conference Organiser, did a clinical placement, etc. It was absolutely amazing for my CV (I don't think I would've gotten my current post-doc without this experience). I loved the different roles, and dipping into teaching was super important as I see myself working as a lecturer in the future.\n\nWhat I loved the most about my PhD is the research freedom. I had two very experienced supervisors who guided me when it came to methodology and some of the more complex epistemological issues in my field, but I really was allowed to research issues and gaps that I found to be most relevant and interesting, and was genuinely passionate about. I managed to publish two papers from my PhD during my studies in really good journals, after several rounds of some brutal reviewers. But I did it. I was so proud, it gave me a sense of achievement, and I got to know the ins and outs of publishing. In the meanwhile, I contributed to a few other research strands within other unis/depts, and that was really great experience (working as a main author and a co-author is very different and I think there are some politics that must be learnt in both processes). At the end of my PhD, I published more than some of the lecturers in my dept (which was huge for me - I remember the TA in my undergrad years used to ask if I used Thesaurus for my writing, and I took that rather seriously lol).\n\nPre-COVID, I loved conferences. I had PhD funding, and this allowed me to travel to different countries, which is something that I never did before my PhD. I made connections, met new colleagues and friends.\n\nI loved the work freedom during my PhD years. I could come into the office or work from home. I could start my day at 9am or at 11pm. As long as I did the work, I could do it at my convenience. I never stayed in the office over the weekends, never stayed in the office overnight, never went one night sleepless, and still managed to finish a full-time PhD in 3.5 years while also working other jobs. Don't listen to people who say that you have to do either one or all of those to be a 'real' PhD researcher - it's all about working smart.\n\nI loved my viva experience, too. My examiners were very nice, not overwhelmingly aggressive, but thorough. We had an enjoyable academic discussion rather than some form of 'grilling examination'.\n\nAnd, I really really enjoyed learning about new things. PhDs are weird like that; you are meant to be an 'expert' in your own niche area of research, but really, we just end up being more curious/inquisitive/questioning about a set of particular questions that we began with. And, contrary to some people, I found that experience to be rewarding.\n\nPhDs are meant to be, and *are*, frustrating. And it's more likely that, when we get frustrated about research, we end up posting on Reddit. The good bits we tend to enjoy ourselves, quietly.

I am hopefully finally defending my diss and getting my degree this academic year (so it'll be 7 years total), and I still have no regrets about spending that time working toward my PhD.  \n\nA caveat though: I am lucky to have an incredible advisor and mentor, and I truly love my dissertation topic and it is personally meaningful as well. A lot of people who are unhappy in their programs usually do not have supportive advisors, may be in a toxic workplace/department, or really hate their dissertation topic. It seems as if you are personally invested in your area of study, and that it means quite a bit to you, and I think that is a positive sign re: starting your PhD program!

It's a *choice* that I knew was going to be in most of my 20s. **And it was a choice I can leave at any point.** But I didn't care about how much I made, and enjoyed just doing cool shit. And I did a lot of cool shit, have a lot of great stories from the experience. You don't have to go into it, you don't have to stay. \n\nThe reality that my own agency granted my own fate gave me a lot of psychological power. You should be given the freedom of your own time to balance and do things as necessary. You can get a job and *not get the damn PhD*. And it's usually early enough in someone's career that *they can opt out or pivot*. I was shocked to find out that they actually *pay for you to do your education*, and the mindset that the *pay* included the price of the education. I don't have be sticking around in a place that simply made me unhappy or drove me nuts. And I wasn't burdened by the need to get a degree. My parents, in contrast, were lower-middle class blue collar workers. They got paid *worse than a postdoc*.\n\nThe difference in perspective is choice and agency. You have freedoms as a grad student, you have levels of protection, and you should be taking advantage of those things.\n\nThe PhD wasn't my whole life because, frankly, it wasn't. Nobody's really stopping you from frankly going home at 5 PM, or taking an extra day off here or there. And it was my choice to come in on Saturdays, or to read papers at night, or do take on new projects I found interesting. Yes, there were stressful times, and some days I frankly just zoned out and didn't do anything, or had an extended lunch break, or whatnot. But that's the thing, balancing is important.\n\nI had a much more difficult time during my postdoc, where it really was leading to closing some career doors and limitations in job options. But as a PhD student, I had the mentality of a student that could leave anytime and had options open to me.\n\n&gt; Not to forget the fact that many supervisors actually have no life and want you be like them. I write this while working 7 days a week and always online or lab with my P.I. and I'm not the only one. Yours is a privilege but this OP should know that. \n\nIt's really important to pick the right supervisor and the right mentors. To figure out the right lessons to learn. That doesn't always happen.\n\nI did work hard, but again, that was my own fucking choice. I usually worked 6 days a week, sometimes 7. I also took random days off, went to the movies in the middle of the day, had extended lunches. I was careful about making sure my own burning out.\n\nIf you're working for a PI that's driving you insane to that point, then the considerations are (a) finding a new PI, (b) finishing as soon as possible, or (c) leaving. Yes, there's a ton of bad bosses, but again, I think people have more choice in the matter than they think they do.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oco2s2/im_about_to_start_my_phd_and_reading_this_thread/h3y6fws/"}, "645": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "mik_u", "Date": 1625340410, "Score": 1, "Body": "Wow, I have a master\u2019s degree and was thinking about a PhD but I thought people only got it to work in Academia or Research.

If the OP goes by this take of yours, I bet you they will be right back complaining about it ina few years. Btw, I would like to know how much your student loans debt are since you do not believe that PhDs should be paid for their work and time. Technically, they are not paying for your \"education\" because you do put in the work and contributions. With my Master's degree, I was making a whole lot more in terms of wages and had more protections and benefits than I am in my PhD, and for doing the same type of job descriptions (Research Assistant and Project Manager for the lab). But again, I agree, it is a choice we all make to earn this degree and that's all the OP has to take into consideration. Rather than asking why so many miserable posts, they could endeavor to note down the most popular complaints and try to avoid falling into the same holes. I'm sure many of these posts come from people who wish someone has told them ahead of time on the precautions to take. \n\nAnd you say it so casually as if changing P.Is two years into the game due to toxic behavior doesn't come with the added consequences of lost time, lost dreams and trying to restart publications all over again in a new group because your former P.I will never allow you use materials from their lab since you left.\n\nBut again, like you said, it's all about mindset and choosing to keep fighting on but let's not make it seem like it's a walk in the park. I think we all could benefit from hearing more happy posts but truth is there's very little happiness in the process but the joy lies in hitting the milestones (publications, manuscripts, grant funding, defences, candidacy, dissertation, etc.). Maybe more people should share about how P.Is helped to uplift and elevate their journey or something. I certainly can count many happy moments from getting funds, awards, scholarships, initiatives, etc. But they seem weird when I consider the abuse I went through to getting those. Let's not pretend like PhD students have freedom or protection from the abuse of many P.I. except choosing to leave to another group. And let's not act like PhD students have time and can choose not to work themselves to stupor because the P.I wants output submitted and presented everything week. Let's not ignore the fact that many PhD students are juggling family obligations like the OP and are just beginning to have kids or get married, and hence they either have to choose spending more home time or spending more lab time and this has consequences for how soon they can graduate. Let's also not pretend like P.Is aren't absolutely in love with those students who are constantly working and producing results and making their lab proud. All of these have consequences for how much time, energy and rewarding experiences one can have as a PhD.

If the OP goes by this take of yours, I bet you they will be right back complaining about it ina few years. Btw, I would like to know how much your student loans debt are since you do not believe that PhDs should be paid for their work and time. \n\nReading comprehension and context is your friend.\n\nIt's not OPs only take, and the daftness of just reading my comments without context of the greater whole of the topic, along with putting words in my mouth that I didn't claim, is frankly fucking stupid. \n\nI'm not saying that the PhD is for everyone, and it's definitely not a cakewalk. But working in a grad school environment does lend freedoms that I seldom see people take, or I see people have abused. I enjoyed my time, I had a certain mentality, and it frankly just really helped.\n\nI also didn't say that PhDs shouldn't be paid. Frame of reference: I was paid poorly during my PhD, but I also was still able to save, lived on my own, and had financial independence. Compared to undergrad where it came out of pocket. That **does not mean** I don't think PhDs shouldn't get paid. I do think, comparatively, postdoc pay should literally be 1.5x the amount that it's currently going for.\n\nAnd again, if that lifestyle *isn't for you*, then I would seriously reconsider the PhD or consider one's own personal situation. You shouldn't be going into this blind.\n\n&gt;And you say it so casually as if changing P.Is two years into the game due to toxic behavior doesn't come with the added consequences of lost time, lost dreams and trying to restart publications all over again in a new group because your former P.I will never allow you use materials from their lab since you left.\n\nOf course there's consequences. I've had to deal with them, had to make hard choices. \n\nIn the grad school level, though, you have choices available through lab rotations and through your grad program. Again, agency. If you've made such a piss poor decision in staying with a PI *even after having a preliminary period with them*, the decision *really is on you*. And the longer you wait on the agency, the ability to make the change, the more difficult that becomes.\n\nI've seen people in some horrible lab situations where they were consistently abused *since the beginning of their grad experience*. And 4 years in, they *then* regret working for their supervisor. I have no sympathy on the situation; they were advised early to change supervisors, that the guy was fucking toxic. That's a critically poor career decision that individual made.\n\n&gt;But again, like you said, it's all about mindset and choosing to keep fighting on but let's not make it seem like it's a walk in the park. I think we all could benefit from hearing more happy posts but truth is there's very little happiness in the process but the joy lies in hitting the milestones (publications, manuscripts, grant funding, defences, candidacy, dissertation, etc.).\n\nPhDs that play the victim mentality are the ones that suffer the most. Reality is, people don't like being told they made a bad decision. That their choices have contributed to the current state. Blind \"going into your dreams\" mentality, not reaching out to making friends, picking poor advisors based on simply subject area, a lack of personal flexibility, all speak to that sort of naivete.\n\nThere is abuse, and rampant amounts. I've encountered plenty of it during my PhD and postdoc. But the PhD period, especially early on, provides a lot of flexibility to get out of those situations.\n\nAnd as said earlier, *agency*, the *mentality of choice*, understanding your value and pushing for what you need and want, is *so important*.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oco2s2/im_about_to_start_my_phd_and_reading_this_thread/h41itnh/"}, "737": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Useful_Bread_4496", "Date": 1625419442, "Score": 19, "Body": "Can you imagine if it were the PI who wasn\u2019t getting paid lmao", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/odlixo/my_advisor_didnt_approve_my_decision_to_quit_phd/h41jfal/"}, "738": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AtmosphereTall7868", "Date": 1625419757, "Score": 0, "Body": "Sounds like you need context and comprehension skills yourself.

If he\u2019s a relatively new PI and you are part of his first group of students/RA, then ask for a meeting with someone in the graduate studies department. You could ask for an informal meeting, in order to make some enquiries. You can ask hypothetical questions (e.g. \u201cIf someone were to\u2026, what would the procedures and consequences be?) to avoid making a formal request, and just use the opportunity to gather information.

I am doing my PhD in the Netherlands, where it is a strict 4-year full-time lab position. I am the father, so I got the legal 2 weeks of paternity leave and took 2 additional weeks as vacation. That was all I could spare really, and now sadly I am back to working 7 days / week for the remaining couple months. My wife (not in academia) has longer maternity leave and is doing all the child rearing for the time being, which I think is not entirely fair but can't be helped at the moment. I try to support where I can (e.g. diaper duty at night), but until my contract ends, most of the responsibility lies with her. Luckily we get plenty of support from the family, otherwise it would be far trickier. \n\nWhat I had not expected was how supportive both my PhD supervisors and fellow scientists would be - unanimously they have been very positive and willing to help out. None of that toxic \"don't have kids if you plan on an academic career\" crap that I was taught to expect. I am apparently incredibly lucky. \n\nThat said, I think it would be a lot harder to actually manage a pregnancy during a PhD - at least in a biology lab it's tough to not do benchwork with moderately dangerous substances (fixatives, viruses, cell culture...), and 9 months is a long time in any project. I think there is a reason that of the 15 female PhDs in our labs, none was having children until after they graduated, and until recently the only ones with kids were the (all male and much older) PIs. I wish it would be different (and surely there are places where it is), but in my direct environment it's a massive penalty that unfairly lands with the women scientists. \n\nFrom my own experience, once the child is there, you will be unable to do any meaningful work for at least a month, even with maximally supportive partner / parents / social contacts. This is true for fathers/partners and doubly so for the mother - in the beginning, it's just all very direct interaction and viscerally getting used to a new human that is totally dependent on you. This outranks almost anything else in importance, and runs on a completely different schedule than normal adult life (think in blocks of 3h around the clock, for weeks). It's absolutely great of course, but it's a crash course in efficient time planning and prioritizing. It also very much depends on a supportive environment - an easy way to gauge would be to see who already has children in your wider environment, and ask them about their experience.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/odp2c5/how_much_hardereasier_is_it_to_have_kids_during/h4289va/"}, "771": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Dr-NguyenVanPhuoc", "Date": 1625432480, "Score": 4, "Body": "the chair of the department usually cares about perception though. i guess you have to make the threats public for the chair to care", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/odlixo/my_advisor_didnt_approve_my_decision_to_quit_phd/h429jfi/"}, "772": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "Chart-Sudden", "Date": 1625432513, "Score": 1, "Body": "You need a counselor.

Sounds like you're in a trough.  There are a few things I have found helpful when in a trough.   \n\n\n1. Look back over what you did (keeping some notes and records of what you do is n.b. for this reason).  Take stock of what you did. Take a breath. It can feel like you've been slogging through bogs for months, but when you turn around it can feel like you're on a high hill, looking back over miles and miles you have travelled.  \n\n  \n2. The obvious ones; exercise, socialise, eat healthy.  We don't own our bodies we are our bodies. If your body is unwell you will feel bad.  It is as simple as that. \n\n  \n3. Take a beat to be creative.  Draw pictures of what you would like to do.  For me, making a graphicla plan of my next steps, with very tickable (I draw wee boxes which represent some discrete amount of work, such as read 5 pages, write 500 words, etc) that I shade in as I accomplish them. Making the next part of the work tangible, visible and manageable has often spurred me into working.   \n\n\n4. Write? Not writing that will be included in the thesis but just scribbling writing, hacking at a keyboard in a notepad writing, writing that you will not keep or use, just let yourself write.  You might be surprised by what comes out from the depths of your mind.  Try not to think about it, in fact try not to think about it&gt; Try to write faster than you are thinking of what you might say. Sometimes that can be rejuvenating.    \n\n\nWhat you are doing is hard.  Know that. Be conscious of it.  And these moments that you are feeling now, this is what it means tos ay it is hard. It is unpleasant at times. It is dark, damp and difficult to see a way out or find motivation.  It can be lonely and frightening. It is hard.  But you are doing it.

I started doing research and learnt about ADD/ADHD. I did enough research and I started believing that I have ADHD and I must visit a doctor. I'm afraid of high dose of medicines and mainly their possible side-effects. I somehow believed that those symptoms could be because of some other reasons. I looked up to all possible reasons that came to my mind and I realised that may be my diet and lifestyle could be the reason. I am a vegetarian so I have some deficiencies mainly B12 and omega-3. I started taking supplements, doing exercise and eating healthy. I made a lot of changes to my lifestyle. My focusing has improved greatly now. Other symptoms also have greatly reduced. Had I visited doctor that time, I might have been diagnosed with ADHD!!! Lately, I started doing meditation and I'm seeing further improvement in my focusing and overall well-being.\n\nMy point is that every symptom is not ADHD. The symptoms may have been triggered by some other reasons. It could be due to depression, trauma, nutrition deficiency or other myriads of things. Have you heard of epigenetics?  Researchers are now turning from genetics to epigenetics to explain ADHD. If this is my ignorance, then okay I will take it somewhere else!!

There are multiple genes that all cooperate to produce the symptoms of ADHD. Which is one of the reasons that ADHD as a disorder can be so varied as mentioned in my earlier comment. For example, DAT1 and DRD4 are two such genes responsible for dopamine transmission and reception in the brain which provide some explanation for why people with ADHD very often have lower base levels of dopamine. Some other genes that have been researched to contribute to ADHD are SLC6A4, SNAP25, NOS1, SLC9A9, LPHN3, HTR1B, GIT1, GFOD1, CDH13, CNR1, CHRNA7.

Then, one of my illnesses kicked into high gear, I got really sick and thought I was going to die, and realized: fuck this shit, nothing is worth my health or life. I then started working much less, drawing clear boundaries around work, and spending a lot more time taking care of myself. Then COVID happened, which really threatened my already fragile mental health, and I paired back on work anymore. I now work probably 6-7 hours of good, productive hours 5 days a week, almost never working weekends or after 6 pm. I work much less than many of my peers, but I actually end up getting more done because I take vigorous care of myself and don't push myself past my limits. I will also note that I've been pretty successful in terms of scholarship, publishing, teaching, and awards. \n\nIf you're worrying about working less than your peers, a couple things...first of all, working more doesn't necessarily mean working better or getting more done. Second, you're disabled. You have a chronic illness. Your max capacity probably has a much lower threshold than many of your peers. You are different people with different needs and limits.

The goal of a Ph.D. is to contribute new knowledge to your area of expertise, and you need to pick a program that allows you to do that in the area you're interested in. If the research they focus on isn't up your alley, find a different lab or school. While you are visiting schools and individual labs, make an effort to talk to current students. Get a sense for the school environment/atmosphere. Are grad students included on campus? Is the school/lab cutthroat or cooperative? Does the student's impression of the PI match what the PI told you about themselves? You want to make sure you get into a place that meets your needs for support, competition and morale. You need to consider the location, because you're going to be living there for at least 4 years.

A lot of schools are moving away from standardized testing because they are finally accepting the systemic issues with that system, but the GRE is still a very common requirement.

So take it, try to do at least the average of your target schools, and then don't sweat it if you fall short.

If they have time they might agree to regular summer meetings to help narrow down a topic and offer focused reading lists about it.\n2) even people who are well prepared for SSHRC/doctoral award applications can send it in and not get it.

I drafted my life experiences that promoted my thinking and ability to do science. After that initial 3 page crappy draft (purpose was to get it on paper so I could pick out what I wanted to include in the final paper), I wrote another draft. I scrapped that one. So I wrote another. I scrapped that one too. I got feedback from 2 people. Finally I finished it. I go into the biomedical program website to submit my PS and I find out that they are asking completely different things from all other schools. It\u2019s a private university, go-figure. So now I have 3 days to write this. I was so frustrated. So I did what any scientist/good human being would do. I wrote it in the light of honesty. \n\nI started with the environment that promoted my research capacity. Re-Summarized my accomplishments in the first first paragraph in a different way from my SOP. Transitioned into my next paragraph using a strength.\n\nThe second paragraph talked about a trauma that I fought through (physically) which inspired me to become stronger in my research.\n\nNext paragraph talked about the pandemic and how I was alone in lab doing research. But regardless of being alone I was able to get shit done. I ended with how this experience taught me the importance of giving yourself without expectation of anything return.\n\nLast paragraph, I talked about how my research interactions with people and my own pursuits aim me towards the future (post-PhD, what I want to do with the degree). This paragraph used my imagination to talk about a rough idea of what kind of research I want to get into. \n\nUltimately, there was \u201cflow\u201d and \u201cstructure\u201d to my statement which complemented my SOP because it gave my reader an understanding of who I was (my thinking), what happened to me to bring me here to them, and what I want to do with the training.\n\n\nStatement of Purpose: I talked about how I got into research, the skills I acquired (big picture skills, not molecular skills; managerial, multiple projects, etc.), and what I want to do with the degree.\n\nThen I made a long paragraph on how I prepared myself to get there through my research as an undergraduate. Technical style of writing (scientific written style) was used for this paragraph (field specific). \n\n\nFor both statements they wanted a max of 750 words and for both I wrote 500. Instead of maxing out and blabbing on. I was clear and concise. I could not have been more concise without losing meaning. So my recommendation for you is to do the same. The search committee has to read a boat load of these papers. In my opinion, I think it\u2019s impactful to be memorable through being the person who said the most while writing the least. I thought about how I would feel after a long day of reading these. I would want short and sweet.\n\nI wish you luck in your preparation and don\u2019t be like me! Write them ahead of time (now) and have people look at them (professors in humanities ideally, they\u2019re great writers). For the SOP your field professors should give you edits more so than humanities but I\u2019m not sure. Ideally your statements will be done by October/November so you can give your recommenders time to write you bangin\u2019 letters. And you won\u2019t be stressed, writing at 5 in the morning the nights before they are due. \n\nFinal piece of advice from my mentor, treat this like a 3-4 credit/unit class.

My advice would be that you ask yourself if it makes any more sense to cpntinue that program or if it will do nothing but leave you burned out. If you want I have a few suggestions and Ideas for you:\n\nSince I have heard some similar stories my first instinct was you were doing a PhD in Germany so I went to your profice (forget me for being nosy) and guess you're at MPI Munich? Now PhD working conditions in Germany can be shit but luckily there is some counter measures. Are you employed on TV\u00f6D or on a scholarship?\n\nIn the case you want to continue, you may want to contact the responsible people from MPI or your uni which can help you improve your working conditions. This can be the workers council, ombudsperson, equality officer, PhD representatives etc. Your intitute should have a landing page fro that. \n\nIf you can prove that your PI keeps threatens you with consequences for taking holidays, this is something the workers council, ombudsperson or a PhD representative organisation can help you with. It gives the impression, that you will burn yourself out if you don't take days off or go to your home country and see your family and I guess it doesn't help to have a burnout and no PhD in case to just have no PhD. \n\nMy aforementioned institutes are also the ones you would want to contact if you want to switch supervisors. \n\nNow if you want to continue your PhD in this group, I would suggest to contact the aforementioned institutions about how to improve your working conditons. \n\nTake some holiday! What can your PI do against it? If he does not allow you to take holidays, directly go to the workers council. Given my understanding of German legislation you may just leave if you have the right to take holidays, but at least he cannot deny you from taking days off. \n\nAsk yourself how you want your PhD to look like: will you write a cumulative PhD or a monnography? It may be that you PI expects you to write a monnography wich could be a reason for wy he does not think publishing is a priority. He might be old-school to that extent and expect you to just put your results in a monography at the end of your PhD. If you write a cumulative PhD this might sound like a stupid question but: does he know? Does he know what that means? It might help to tell him you need papers in that case. \n\nAlso in case you want to continue you may want to get to know more people. Maybe your insitute offers a PhD-lunch where you can have lunch with other colleagues not in your working group? If not, maybe you can start it. Apart from that, you may be enrolled in University and be able to take part in their sports programme to meet people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, if all of this doesn't yield any results, I would advise you to quit and look for a job or another PhD. I get from your text that you are from a non-Schengen country? Now in case you started your PhD on a working contract (not a scholarship) you get 6 months of \"Arbeitslosengeld\" (60 % of your income) per one year that you worked there until up to 12 months of allowances. This comes on top of your 3 months cancellation-notification time (K\u00fcndigungsfrist) and whatever holidays you have. \n\nNow if you want to quit but find a job in Schengen, here's what you do: Take all of your holidays. Now note that it is illegal for your boss to completely forbid you to take holidays, so you will get some of those. He is thus not able to fire you just for that and he should have a reason to do so anyways. If he finds one, you get 3 month of notification time at full pay. If not, tell him you do not want to get a PhD but only fulfill your working hours as stated in your contract for a \"wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter\". If he doesn't fire you for that, fine, you now work 9-5 and can search for a job at the side while being paid. If he fires you, you get 3 months of paid time until you're out, then afterwards 6-12 months at 60% Arbeitslosengeld. (here it is important that you enroll as a student with 50% to hold a student visa while being available to the job marked). Now summing up you have about a year of income to find a better suiting job or PhD somewhere in Schengen. If you hate Bavaria, maybe you want to check out Belgium, the Netherlands or the Rheinland for friendlier people, or Scandinavia for better working conditions. \n\nIn any case: good luck and feel free to ask me questions, also per pm.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/of3vvr/phd_with_colleagues_and_pi_from_hell_no/h4bysxy/"}, "1229": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ReddRepublic", "Date": 1625646415, "Score": 3, "Body": "If you want to maximize your earning potential, I am not so sure whether another degree is worth the time it will take you to get it.

This should be based purely on quantitative metrics like: Time to completion of students, Number of student per year, number of students with first authored papers, a thumb print on what research space a PI is actually active in over the last 4-7 years, number of students that fail viva under thier supervision, retention rate of students, number of students that master out under thier supervision, number of students as a first supervisor or second supervisor.\n\nThe one thing I would open up for students to add would be how often they meet with thier supervisor.

It didn't necessarily hurt me, but I don't think it particularly helped. One downside is that it got me out of the classroom and so going back into a school setting (assuming you will have any classes, sometimes you don't need to) felt way harder after the break. This was made worse by the pandemic, which started while I was working, so I left school in person and then started again a year later when everything had been online for a semester already and most people had already figured everything out except for me. Hopefully things won't keep changing quite as drastically, but you can probably still expect the transition back to school to be at least a little challenging. \n\nYou'll also need to make sure you keep in contact with good references from your schools. The longer it's been since you've worked with a reference, the less they'll remember you and the less likely they'll be to write a good letter. That's not always the case, but it's something to keep in mind. You might be able to use a work reference if your work is at all related to what you want to go into the PhD for, or if it's anything scientific, but if not I would definitely stick with academic references. Some programs only want academic references anyway, and will provide guidance in the application information. \n\nThe biggest upside for working in my case was being able to save money. Moving is expensive, and unless you're only planning on applying to places close to where you currently are, you're going to want to have some savings. Depending on the school, you may also need to pay expensive student fees as well, or for a visa application if you're an international student. Depending on the job you're looking at, you may build useful skills for your PhD. If you're looking into going into a PhD that's in a slightly different subject area from your previous degree(s), you could also benefit from doing work that's closer to your interest so that you'll have a bit more background in it. It's also nice to take a break from school if you need one; I can't say that working was much less stressful than school for me, because my work year was during a pandemic which made it a million times more stressful, but if you're not the kind of person who really enjoys a school/university environment, it can be good to take a step back. \n\nTldr: it depends!

You also want to pick an advisor that meshes with you. From a professional standpoint you want to go with a respected lab whose alumni have the type of jobs you want after you finish.\n\nOnce you have picked an advisor:\n\n1. Get a handle on some of your labs recent theses. Go through the papers that appear in several of the theses. \n1. Jump in head first to your work. If you are in a computational lab start breaking some codes. If you are in an experimental lab start breaking some equipment. I mean, don\u2019t literally break stuff, but don\u2019t be afraid to try things. The sooner you start the sooner you can finish.\n1. Get to know the tools of your trade. Some of them your advisor might not know about. Learn about github/bitbucket for code and writing version control. Learn a programming language. Learn LaTeX. Learn the main commercial code packages your industry uses.\n1. Try to learn as much from your lab mates as possible.\n1. Try to learn from other professors. This will only help you in the long run. \n\nThe way I learn best is through working on little projects. So if I could do it again I would have tried to some little projects for myself at the beginning to get going. Run a little experiment and try and replicate a fundamental result. Run some computational simulations and try and replicate some fundamental results. Overall, play to your own personal learning style to do what you need to do. \n\nLong term, near the end, you are going to have to learn how to tell you advisor \u201cno\u201d.  No you can\u2019t do that random task, no you can\u2019t spend six more months on a new part of your thesis.

Ask mostly domestic students who are in other related programs in the department but are not the P.I's students or even the non-teaching staff; the reputation of most P.Is go before them.

Both are good alternatives for a career. But those who want a career in industry will probably do an MBA and get work experience, while those who want a career in academia will do a PhD and get research experience. Doing a PhD to go to industry afterward is a waste of time for us, and that would happen a lot if the programs accepted many students. From what I see, in engineering you see more PhD students who consider both industry and academia for their future. So, they can see more PhD students graduating and being happy with that outcome. \n\nAnother possible reason is the nature of the research itself. It seems to me that many other fields require large teams working on the same project, so you need more people. In marketing, research is usually just the PhD student and the advisor. We don't need large teams. \n\nAnd I guess there is the financial aspect of it. I see people from other fields worrying about  getting funds, writing grants, etc. Although that's a lot of work, with more money they can get more people. It's not like that in marketing.

However, there are many students in your position who do not make best friends in their program. Friend groups tend to naturally form within cohorts, and sometimes, not everyone is included. Try your best not to get hung up and understand that it truly may not be a slight against you.

From my personal experience I can tell you that if you deal with the little inconveniences that come with change, you will get to enjoy some of the life changing benefits it brings you. \n\nIt's good to have friends and family around you, but nothing helps you grow up and understand yourself like solitude.

In my field (history) and country (UK) there is an institution that does this for my field  - it essentially supports them with extra time for more ambitious projects. I can provide info if you want so you can see the sort of thing I mean. In this scenario you are probably funding someone who is already on a programme, has supervisors in place, and potentially is already some way into their project.\n\nThere is also a database of funding for postgraduate students - this might be helpful if you were interested in funding an MA students as well or instead of just PhDs. It is very hard to get funding for MAs in many countries. You could be much more specific if you go this route as you could frame the criteria to match what you want the PhD to focus on. However I imagine there is a lot more work associated with this and you and the proposed student would still need to find supervisors and institutions - unless you choose to fund a pre-existing student.\n\nAnother option is to find a department you like and approach them. They will probably bite your hand off. This is likely the easiest route but might limit how much say you have over the final output. You could specify that the grant will be for PhD students with experience in particular fields and for projects that deal with a specific outcomes. This seems the best/easiest option to me. I would say you are best off looking for a department which matches your philosophy and goals. Perhaps even specific researchers who are already doing work which matches what you want the project to do.\n\nBest of luck with it - these are just my initial hasty thoughts.

PhD is not the time to get into debt. You are getting older and taking a PhD is already a hit to your earnings.  If anything - you should find ways to have savings during a PhD. If your specialty allows it - do part-time consulting or freelancing. Ideally you want to be earning the same amount during your PhD as  if you entered the job market.  I don't know the laws in mainland Europe, but in UK, PhD stipend is untaxable. So if you are lucky and are getting 20k as a stipend - you can freelance for another 10k tax-free. Totalling 30k a year which is equivalent of what you'd get entering a tech job as new grad (post tax).   \n\n\nRe: friends/bf\n\nThe only thing I have to say about this is to encourage to ask yourself if you are really sentimental about your friends/bf or is it that you are just  afraid of change and risk.

Don't take this for granted.  They are absolutely right. And if you're not getting along with your supervisor - switch. Unis should have a way of switching advisors.

I\u2019m doing a PhD and I also work in a staff role at the same large research university so I have probably a more realistic perspective than most people on this.\n\nThis is actually not easy to do - at least directly and to the tune of what you\u2019re thinking. For it to count as a scholarship for tax reasons, it should be set up through the university, rather than just given directly to the student or supervisor (which is a terrible idea, contrary to half the replies here). Conversely, the university (which doesn\u2019t just \u201ctake 50%\u201d by the way - no idea where that came from) will likely not be interested in setting up a one time scholarship for one student that comes from a private donor. I appreciate that the amount you\u2019re talking about is very generous and would be hugely impactful to a single student but the fact is that most universities will not care about a donation that small and would not create a scholarship with it. \n\nIf you want to give it to a university to manage, I would suggest either making a donation to a large fundraising scholarship fund that the university has control over (though you\u2019ll never find out where exactly your money went) or upping your amount to the tune of something that could be endowed and used in perpetuity. \n\nAnother option would be to set it up through a non profit foundation. I have no knowledge about this process but they might be more willing to accept smaller gifts. The downside is that the foundation would have full control over how the award is given and my impression is that this process is not always very transparent. Also these private scholarships don\u2019t always receive a lot of applicants so you run the risk of sponsoring someone who\u2019s just well connected. \n\nSorry for the pessimism but hope that helps.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ohfuh8/id_like_to_provide_a_phd_scholarship_but_im_not/h4psbeo/"}, "1759": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Longjumping-Annual59", "Date": 1625935454, "Score": 2, "Body": "Being honest with yourself is the first step.

I don't see how you keep a job while doing a business PhD without negative consequences, really affecting your performance in at least one of your jobs. \n\nYou want a degree from a respectable school.

We have been forced to do things online due to the pandemic, of course. But it's pretty clear that this harms the PhD experience.

If you're starting your PhD at 22/23 years old, and stuck with the *one thing* over the course of 6 years, of course that's to be expected.\n\nAnd as a neuroscience PhD, I will say that I wholly agree that the normal \"path\" that's presented is limiting in jobs. The thing is, if you're willing to take a risk very far from outside of what you're told to do and can forge your own path (and risk here is really relative; most risks actually have a higher chance of producing fruitful experiences than doing the thing you're told to do), the training combined with creativity of the individual to branch beyond what everyone else does make it powerful and useful. The problem is that most mentors in the PhD program are so terrible at even trying to help students find or look into those options, let alone *encourage them* to explore those options, that you're left to fend for yourself in many cases.\n\nIt can really lead people to be in a rut or crushed by expectations, especially with the unknown. \n\nFor me, I loved research during my PhD, but about three years into my postdoc I realized that if I didn't pivot hard and actually seek out applicable skills and projects that *I* believed in and really started independent of whatever my PI wanted, I'd be fucked. It was a very mitigated risk, but a bullish attitude combined with a lot of luck (both serendipitous and reinforced by my own actions) helped me. \n\nI do have a job now that really does rely on my PhD experience, but my PhD experience has also been off the beaten path because I found the normal route really ends up pigeonholing people, and because I frankly thought there were more interesting perspectives and ideas to integrate *with* neuroscience rather than keeping it so insular (e.g. applying other fields like engineering and so forth into the mix). I really had to fight for it, and it's really not for everyone.\n\nIf you're in your late 20s, sometimes it's just the want of having a stable life and job.\n\nRegardless of your decision, take the time to really flexibly plan of what you want to do next. Know how to exit, know what you want, do not optimistically think things will \"eventually happen\" and expect changes, but really map out the future course.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ojcnl1/i_think_im_quitting/h527v82/"}, "2221": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "EggPan313", "Date": 1626199002, "Score": 1, "Body": "Really give yourself time.\n\nIn your peak, when things are great, leave early, go for a walk.

She's also not interested in staying in academia and I think if I hadn't told her how much I enjoy my PhD she might've chosen a different path that would have suited her better.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ojxj21/do_you_have_any_regret_choosing_to_pursue_a_phd/h54jbv5/"}, "2318": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "okalydokalyneighbor", "Date": 1626242592, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank you for sharing!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ojxj21/do_you_have_any_regret_choosing_to_pursue_a_phd/h54jgx2/"}, "2319": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "shantirchhele", "Date": 1626243429, "Score": 1, "Body": "yes", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ojqmk1/support_group_for_those_considering_quitting/h54khc0/"}, "2320": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dakoodaddy2020", "Date": 1626243444, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank you for saying this !", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ojal7t/phd_econ_never_published/h54ki19/"}, "2321": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dakoodaddy2020", "Date": 1626243471, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yes, I have heard that too.

In contrast, my impression is that in the European system (I guess it may vary by country) it takes closer to 3, with master's being a pre-requisite/first part of the American PhD. I feel you can get to a lot of financially better places with a master's if we're talking about an American PhD.\n\nThat said, if immunology research is your calling, of course you should give it a try, BUT you should have an idea of what you plan to do with your degree.

These are primarily a) financial and b) career-orientated.\n\nFor a), doing a PhD when you are in your 20s and 30s generally represents a massive opportunity cost. I say this a lot around here because this isn't spelled out enough to potential PhD candidates. Through the magic of compound interest your retirement savings are basically determined at this time, and thus the importance of working your way up the ladder within industry cannot be over-stated. Ditto building a wide professional network that can help open doors for you as you get older.\n\nFor b), as we always say around here, a PhD is an apprenticeship for an academic career. Given the paucity of academic positions available, you should make sure you have a viable career mapped out if you do choose to do a PhD. You should also be mentally prepared for potentially years of insecure post-doctoral work.\n\nAlso, your point about being frustrated by having a menial job is valid, but you should note very few people walk into interesting, well-paid jobs off the bat. Entry-level jobs are almost by definition pretty mundane. The most interesting jobs, or those with the most autonomy, are highly competitive and go to those with the most experience, demonstrable managerial skills, and widest professional networks.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ok4zd2/i_am_so_scared_of_doing_a_phd/h57b2zg/"}, "2469": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "littlephdthings", "Date": 1626298908, "Score": 3, "Body": "Hey, I've started a Youtube channel where I aim to talk about little things in a PhD that few people address.

On the other hand, CIFRE Ph.D. students need to be more \"professional\" and fit into their company policies and work-process that can be a little different from academics.\n\nIn terms of publication, it's the research world so everyone aims to publish their work in the best journals/conferences.\n\n\\- Salaries: CIFRE is in the majority of cases paid (way) more than university Ph.D. A \"contrat doctoral\" Ph.D. student's monthly minimum income is 1758 \u20ac (before taxes). In a Parisian uni, it could be higher to compensate for the high rents. A CIFRE Ph.D. student can go to more than 3000 \u20ac/month in big companies. Either way, you will be able to work 100% on your Ph.D. if you're funded.\n\n\\- CIFRE in a little-to-medium company: depend on the company, a world leader in a new tech: yes! A company that needs a master's graduate but uses a \"contrat CIFRE\" to pay you less: nope.\n\nNow my personal take on the subject:\n\n\\- You need to hurry if you want a university-funded PhD., see admission's deadlines in your uni with your professor.\n\n\\- Don't go for the highest paying Ph.D., go for one your passionate about the subject, with a great P.I, and with a good career potential.\n\n\\- A university-funded Ph.D. can be great if you want to start a career in the academic world.\n\n\\- A CIFRE-funded Ph.D. is a great way to find a great job in the same company so try to find a CIFRE in a company you want to work for. You say you want to work for a \"good company\" after your Ph.D.: try to get a CIFRE contract with a good company!\n\n\\- If you want the best from both worlds, do a \"university\" Ph.D. funded by a private-public entity other than a university (like funded by an \"chair industrielle\").\n\nHope my post will help you to answer some of your actual self-interrogation.\n\nEn tout cas, bonne chance dans ton futur p\u00e9riple doctoral !

It's a must have for academia, but in france a PhD isn't always valued as much as three years of work experience, though it depends on the field. Some companies really like PhD, other won't even hire the ones they did a CIFRE with. If you plan on working abroad, other countries will appreciate much a Phd much more than a master, so it's always a plus in this case.\n\n- For publications, I feel like where you publish depends more on the quality of your work than the reputation of the company/lab you're in. Also keep in mind that a CIFRE will usually have a direct application, so you'll publish in journals that are more practical than theoretical (but it still highly depends on the company you're in).\n\n- Fundings are different. All the lab I know seem to struggle with money, but if you really need something they'll buy it or they'll know someone who can lend it, since they have a lot of contacts. Companies might be more generous in this regard.\n\n- Different obligations. You'll have to teach at a university, and in a CIFRE you'll be considered an employee, so you may be asked to do things unrelated to the thesis, that can be time consuming. It's good to know beforehand if it's likely to happen, and how the work is organized (mostly at the partner university, mostly at the company ?).\n\n- Relationship with the P.I. is extremly important. If you know your professor well and both like working with each other, it's a huge plus for doing a PhD with him rather than risk it in a CIFRE.\n\n\nSo overall, it really depends, there are cases where everything I've said is wrong. Get to know the professor, the lab, the company you might do a CIFRE with, talk with the current or former PhD students and you'll get a much better idea than what you can learn on reddit.

In order to process the brain images we collect, some of us need to arrange the files in a highly specific format called BIDS. There are Linux programs that can do it for us with some user input and my advisor asked me three weeks ago to do that with an old dataset they hadn't used before. The advisor also isn't familiar with the programs and I'm the senior grad student. \n\nIt was a nightmare. Over the two years I'd been in the program, I found out I'm actually very good at coding; I pick it up quickly, but the combination of the documentation for the programs I needed being poor and the dataset I was working with being a little out of sorts made me want to pull my hair out. I spent just about every waking moment for three weeks trying to figure out something that should be very simple. I switched to so many different competing programs to get anything to budge. I learned a ton of Python, bash, and JavaScript to make sense of it. I settled on one program I thought should be the best (HeuDiConv, for those interested), but it still wasn't quite working right. I went through several tutorials and they all seemed to give me errors in different places. I eventually figured out they all took for granted that I had different pieces of information or code that they didn't include in their tutorials, so I pieces together what the complete scripts should look like from the pieces that seemed to work and it just worked like a charm.\n\nIt was so anticlimactic to spend three weeks on something, only to see the final product spelled out in 21 lines of code that finish executing in about 2 minutes, but now I know. Plus I'm planning to make a video to connect the things that didn't make sense to me so other people know, so hopefully others are stuck where I was. Also, if anyone is struggling and wants my code or a walkthrough, shoot me a message. \n\nEdit: oh, also the first Neuro paper I wrote, where I learned all of the coding and processing skills I do know, is sitting with the EIC at my first-choice journal, so stoked on that too.

This is a question only the company has the answer to as it\u2019s specific to the company beyond the min. Ask directly about the hours of work they expect, the type of work, the access to data, etc. Some of the people I know doing CIFREs do a substantial amount of admin or company work in addition to research.

That said, you won\u2019t have as much flexibility to deviate from the topic you present in your cifre application.

I don't know if you're going to be working in the Bay Area in general or San Francisco proper, but I expect most of them to apply to most areas in the Bay Area, especially San Francisco proper. For starters, it's an absolutely filthy city. Trash, needles, and actual human feces litter the streets almost everywhere you go. They literally have cleaning services solely designed to clean up the feces. Decaying building and infrastructure is going to be a dime a dozen. Contributing to much of the filth is the ENORMOUS homeless population, likely one of the largest in the US and maybe even of all first world countries. While definitely tragic, it's still an enormous problem that has to be dealt with. Lawlessness is also at an all time high at the moment, something I would really suggest learning about. Theft, robbery, assault, and murder rates are insane and have only been getting worse through a combination of anti-police rhetoric and new cash-less bail policies that mean these criminals are just immediately released after arrest so that they can go re-offend right away. If you're not robbed by a street thug, the government and landlords will be the ones to rob you blind instead. You're probably used to it as a European, but sales taxes, income taxes, and property taxes are astronomically high. With what you do end up having left over, you'll be spending the rest on obscenely high rent costs and generally inflated prices for goods like gas and food. Finally, there's just the cultural and moral degeneracy. A higher than normal amount of people from California are often rude, self centered, narcissistic, vapid, and hollow, a characteristic about the city that I don't think can bode well for anyone's mental well being. Oh, and while I don't know anything about it, I'm going to just make a guess that the public transport systems are abysmal due to poor infrastructure, decay, and overcrowding part the expected capacity. \n\nTo put it in perspective, millions of people are leaving San Francisco and California in general, fleeing to more stable and respectable neighboring states like Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. For one of the first times in forever, the population of California actually DECLINED last year. I don't want to get too political, especially since I get the impression that you lean left (no hate), but in my opinion it's the abysmal left-wing governance that is to blame for these issues in San Francisco. They've been in control for decades and San Francisco has only gotten worse and worse and worse. The problem is, there's no signs of the left wing control changing anytime soon, and thus I don't expect anything to change. \n\nFull disclosure, I do not live in San Francisco. These kinds of things are only from what I've heard and read.

Here is my opinion on your considerations - maybe it helps.\n\n1. Berlin is a large, creative city and I assume that your assessment regarding the job situation is right. From my perspective this is also an important point. Can you be happy if your partner is not happy as she/he does not find a fulfilling job? Doing a PhD can be exhausting sometimes and you will most likely find yourself working on some weekends (especially before deadline), making it even more important that your partner is also somewhat \"busy\". Hope that does not strange. \n2. Although the position in Germany is 4 years, that does not necessarily mean that you need to be done within 4 years. That very much depends on your Prof, but I know a lot of people who needed longer and in some fields its not a problem to switch to another topic after the 4 years, if there is another project available. In computer science, for example, money is often not the constraining resource, but good people are. But like said, this might be different for your Prof. The only real time constraint is given by the Wissenschaftszeitgesetz, a law that basically regulates that you cannot work longer than 6 years at a university while doing your PhD ( there are some loop holes however and don't take my word on this - I am not a lawyer). \n3. Yes, money is fantastic in Germany. If you have a true scholarship than it's even a bit worth than actually working for the university (position is called TVL13 - there are calculators for that on the web). I have talked to people from a variety of other countries during my time and none of them coule even remotely compare to our salary. However, be aware that Berlin's flat market is a complete disaster and getting a reasonably affordable flat in a reasonable area can be super problematic. \n4. As long as your Prof. knows what she or he is doing, I would totally ignore the h-index. From my perspective it is much more important that you \"flow\" on a personal level with your advisor (assuming he is still really good at his stuff) and that he does have indeed time for you. An extremely good advisor, who has basically no time for you will not help you much. Don't underestimate the traction a good advisor can provide - she or he can easily decrease or increase the time you need for your PhD a couple of months if not years. H-index is really not a good metric to judge a potential advisor, imo. Also: make sure that you and your advisor have a similar understanding of \"when you are done\" with your PhD: That being said, get info on how many publications at what level are expected from you before you can write down your thesis. Also: don't underestimate your colleagues. Especially if you are switching the city, ask your potential Prof, how the working climate is within the group: Are there social activities or do people just go their own way? Both might be fine for you, but if not, it's good to know the situation. \n5. Trust me; Bureaucracy can be a nightmare in Germany too - it really depends your university, the Prof, the secretary and whoever else is involved in the process (project managers, etc). It can easily take 8-12 weeks to get a person into her/his position, although things usually go faster if interviews have already been done. Overall, Germany is king of complicated processes. Also, depending on from which country you are coming, getting the necessary visa might be lot's of \"fun\". For example, if you come from Iran, things can be super complicated (although they mostly work out in the end).\n6. Cannot comment on that. \n\nOverall, I believe that Germany is a great place to live. The salary of your job will be pretty decent and you get absolutely fantastic healthcare (compared to some other countries), which you can even upgrade if you get some additional insurances. Sure, we have our problems here, but overall the majority cannot complain.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, feel free to write an answer.

Good knowledge of your field, well-thought research ideas that you can discuss during the interviews, evidence that you have been developing the skills necessary for academic research in your field (e.g., courses on coding with the software and languages they use in your field) are other examples. \n\nA lot of applicants say, for example, that they want to do a PhD to have a deeper knowledge about their field. But you don't really need a PhD to have a deeper knowledge about your field. If you really want a deeper knowledge, have you already done what you can without a PhD? If the answer is no, it's hard to believe the applicant. \n\nThird, strong letters of recommendation. \n\nOf course, it's hard to evaluate whether someone is really a good choice for a PhD. Many applicants aren't sure either. Too many people apply without knowing whether a PhD is really the way to go for them.\n\nSo, people who understand what PhD students face and have experience guiding PhD students in the process are some of the best judges of that. In other words, professors. They have experience evaluating PhD students from beginning to end, they usually know when someone is focused, committed, and have potential to become an academic researcher if they know the person well enough. \n\nThen, getting letters of recommendation can make a big difference.

As much as in my true heart of hearts I know that I actually enjoy the work my PhD entails, the breakdown of my supervisor relationship had warped my thinking and convinced me that I actually hate every aspect of it (but actually when I isolate the issues I have they\u2019re all to do with how my supervisors treat me).\n\nMaybe it\u2019s worth re-evaluating everything and trying to work out if you simply don\u2019t enjoy the research, or if it\u2019s actually just your supervisor relationship that\u2019s taking away from your experience. Changing supervisors is usually possible. As my close colleagues remind me, this is YOUR PhD (not your supervisor\u2019s) and you have the power to take control of it and make it work for you. I\u2019ll also add that at the stage you are in your PhD, things feel more intense because you can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel yet, and the initial novelty of PhD life has worn off.\n\nSorry for the long response, hopefully it helps a little!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/oncftv/dropping_out_of_a_phd_programme_uk/h5r8f3t/"}, "3202": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Tabz508", "Date": 1626706187, "Score": 1, "Body": "Hi.

This is incredibly important.\n\nI can't tell you *how* to separate them (I'm not entirely sure how I did it, other than saying I spent a lot of time interrogating my own thoughts and emotions), but you can't do it alone. You need to do it in tandem with your partner. Tell them you need to be able to think about this thing differently, because the pressure that's being put on it right now is making the job un-doable.\n\nPart of that, I think, involves not trying to explain *why* academic writing is different to, say, writing a report at a job (my ex never understood that and it drove me absolutely spare - \"just write, it's easy\", \"I don't see what's so difficult about it\", \"I have to write complex reports for work all the time\". Absolutely counterproductive). I never, ever found a way of explaining *why* this is different. It's one of those do-it-to-understand-it deals, I think.\n\nBut perhaps what you can do is explain that this is very taxing and stress-inducing on its own, without adding on pressure to \"make life better\".

So yeah, you do need to \"just do it\" - but you also need to find a way of relieving yourself of the pressure of what writing it ***means.*** Because right now it sounds like you and your partner are operating on it meaning that your life can 'begin'.

When the cloud of anxiety hangs over anyone's head, it scrambles are thoughts and it's hard to do anything. Not for lack of trying. This might be why your partner's comments are unhelpful.

Let say you have variable A varying from 0 to 1 meters, and variable B varying from 100 to 1000 kg. They are different scales and the multiple linear regression will \"bias\" the regression to the variable B with the highest values, even if A is a better predictor.

To be honest, it may be the easiest way for you because your field of study doesn't appear to be one that hires people from all around the world in contrast to, for example, IT jobs. In the UK you will likely get a 3 year scholarship to do your PhD, so it is a reasonable commitment but nothing impossible to achieve as long as you like at least a tiny bit the world of research. However, the place where you will work and the people you will work with matter a lot: in other words, the university, lab and supervisor should be chosen carefully, otherwise you can very well end up miserable for 3 years with little to no support during or afterwards. Don't take the first open vacancy but do make your homework and (re)search for the best suitable places and supervisors that align both with your study interests and that are reasonable people to work with.\n\nLast but not least, during your PhD try to take opportunity of things that can improve your CV for the time after the PhD.

Also, if you are, your institution might have resources to help with this - writing centers, people who help with submission processes, etc.\n\nWriting a paper in a week is possible but probably not recommended - it takes a while to structure what you want your paper to say.

From my experience that takes the longest and is most difficult to do effectively, and then just writing the methods and results, and a discussion to again communicate what you found, how it fits with other work on the topic, and where future research might want to go from there.\n\nYou might want to send it to others who have experience with academic publishing so that they can comment on it before you send it out to journals. Then you'd want to start with the journal you think your paper would most fit with. If there is a journal that specializes in digital marketing that might be good, but basically think about who the audience of the paper is, and then send it to a journal that will reach that audience. Without knowing the journals in your field it's difficult to recommend one, which is also where people with experience in publishing can be helpful - they might know which journals would be best for the topic.\n\nEdit to add: Once you send it to a journal, if the journal sends it out for review you'll have to wait for the reviewers to read and comment on it, and then send back their reviews and incorporate their feedback - acceptance on first submission is very rare, usually you'll have to make some edits based on the feedback you get. This is a normal part of research publications and strengthens the paper, but can also take a very long time and involve a bit of back-and-forth with the reviewers, which is where a lot of that time gets added in. Especially right now, reviews are still taking quite a bit longer than they used to and everyone is still a fair bit stressed/overworked, so some journals are having trouble getting people to review articles since it's volunteer-based from the pool of other researchers on the topic.

Year one is all about finding your feet, reading, and starting to learn how research is done. You said yourself that you already noticed you need less supervision now - it's all part of the process, and you'll continue to lean and get more effective as time goes on.\n\nOne of the reasons it feels so hard is because most of the \"tangible\" progress and results will come towards the end of the three years, but they will be built on the things you're doing now. I spent a lot of time in my first year trying out different things that ended up going nowhere. Later on it meant that I was much more efficient because I'd already found out what didn't work. There were also weeks when I felt like I was in the same kind of limbo. Sometimes I just took some days off and watched TV, and it worked out alright in the end. Three years is a lot of days, and you can't/shouldn't work them all.\n\nUltimately I didn't really start *any* of the research that actually made it into my thesis until 1.5-1.7 years in, and even then it took a couple of conference submission cycles before they got anywhere (YMMV with this depending on what venues are important in your field). Trust me that you'll get so much better so quickly as time goes on that most of what you would think of as \"thesis progress\" will actually come towards the end of your time as a PhD student. At least in the UK it's more likely to be 3.5 years anyway, so you might well be less than a third of the way through your journey at this point.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself!

As nice as the title sounds, a PhD is a research-intensive pursuit that culminates in someone becoming evidently capable of pursuing independent research in their field of inquiry. While it comes with the indication that you have exercised enough rigour into your research topic and subsequent research design and implementation, it is seldom the end goal; it is merely a stepping stone into a research career. \n\nA traditional route in academia may look like this:\n\nBachelor's (3-4y) -&gt; Master's (sometimes optional but boosts your prospects as a PhD applicant) and 0+ publications (1-2y) -&gt; PhD and 1+ publications (3-6y depending on institution/country/field) -&gt;\n0-2 postdoctoral fellowship(s) where you research independently (jointly with a principal/co-investigator) for  at least 1-3 years (and publish the hell out of everything)-&gt; research fellowships (where you become a principal investigator and generate your own funding proposals etc, and supervise/publish with your own co-investigators or research students) then you are on your way up the ladder. It's nowhere near as glam as it sounds, and it's a long, arduous, and sometimes painful pursuit. But for some people, it's completely worth it.\n\nThere are alternative pathways to obtaining a PhD, however. A lot of universities offer a PhD-by-publication route, which allows an individual who has not completed a traditional PhD to still get this credential, though you probably need to be at the institution for a number of years and possess the academic prerequisites of at least a Bachelor's degree to be able to secure this. And it's not a cake walk, either.\n\nGiven that you already know plenty about your field, you might have a lot of experience that could translate relatively well into research in your field and even get you through your undergraduate degree relatively quickly, but it might be worthwhile to speak to someone who has entered into academia at a later stage in their career.\n\nHope this helps you find some clarity in making your decision and all the best to you in your future pursuits.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/orcflo/deleted_by_user/h6kb82v/"}, "4057": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "RoboFeanor", "Date": 1627286051, "Score": 1, "Body": "Ups: almost done writing my thesis.\n\nDowns: The last 100 pages I've gotten back from my supervisors have only contained remarks on typos, with no feedback on content or structure.

This probably echos a lot of the other comments, but here is an anecdote from my PhD that might help (theoretical physics - 3 year research + 1 year writing up - UK): \n\nMy PhD was split into two projects, the first a simpler one but with the potential for some super helpful results, and the second a much more in depth mathematical derivation, which would provide a full description of something we\u2019d been approximating up till now. Anyway \u2026 \n\nMy first project took me about 2 years. I went back and forth checking some maths, getting it wrong, getting confused about what to do, panicking, crying, being too scared to ask for help (which was silly, but there we are). \n\nBy the end of that project, we moved onto project number 2, I was freaking out because oh my god, the SIMPLER bit took me 2 years, how the hell was I going to do the more complicated bit? \n\nHere\u2019s where you can probably relate: I then looked back at my last 2 years of work and realised that if you gave it to me now, I could probably do the whole calculation in a month. It was absolutely trivial and I was SO angry with myself for having \u201cwasted\u201d 2 years. \n\nBut really, it only seemed trivial now because I\u2019d already done it. You\u2019ve dedicated the last year to doing that stuff, of course it seems trivial to you, but at the start it didn\u2019t! And the things you\u2019ve learned doing that will make everything go so much smoother from now on. All of your learning is progress, so include what you\u2019ve done in your report even if it seems trivial to you too! \n\nTo end the story on a happy note: the skills and confidence I gained from that first project that took a silly amount of time for what it was, meant that my MUCH harder second project actually only took about a year, and we spent a good chunk of time adding extra to the first project as well for even more helpful results and that actually just got accepted for publication, a month after I successfully defended my thesis! \n\nEveryone\u2019s PhD is different, it sounds to me like your first year was just that - your first year! When asked for your achievements, don\u2019t think of just the big finished things! What problems did you encounter and fix? What did you learn from doing that?

She should include her costs and that she's self-funded. There is a chance if it's approved she MAY receive a tuition refund or have her tuition applied to the next year.  No guarantees but worth a shot.  She needs to schedule a discussion with her department's postgraduate research director/coordinator ASAP to discuss. If no joy or direction, move on to student support services and see where they direct her. \n\nThen for the money aspect: she needs a separate, itemised research funding proposal for her department's/ faculty's higher degrees funding rounds. These are often department level where they allocate research funds based on the proposal and supervisor statement, so she'll need to work with her supervisor(s) for developing this.  Look for other postgraduate groups/ colleges/ funds throughout the university that fund research and field work.  Then make the case of why some of these funds should be used for sending samples,  etc., in lieu of fieldwork.  I've seen these out of the box requests go through,  usually they end up being cheaper than a fieldwork request. She should also be in touch with the international student office to see if they have additional support. \n\nAgain,  it all depends on institution and how it is setup.

I am partially-funded through my uni in Canada in a non-STEM field.

This makes for a lot more of a straightforward path and a somewhat pre-assigned research topic. For myself, because I work under the supervision of my supervisor (versus working for them), I have a lot more flexibility, have a to set my own budget, plan my research, etc., etc. I work in and outside the university at the same time, and truly I haven't had that much of an issue.\n\nGathering massive debt for ANY form of education is a bad idea, not just PhDs - I wonder if these same people blasting the self-funded PhDs had a full ride for their bachelors...

It\u2019s literally the first requirement in the PhD handbook of any UK program. \n\nArchaeology has become a seriously divided field where many archaeologists argue whether it\u2019s even a field any more because the method, theory, and philosophies of different archaeology are so distinctly different that many archaeologists can\u2019t even talk to each other. \n\nIt\u2019s as if you and 60,000 of your friends were creating a puzzle and you\u2019re each given 1 piece to design. There are no prerequisites, you just make a puzzle piece. For archaeology there are essentially 60,000 puzzle pieces that are so different you\u2019d think they come from different puzzles. Some are 3D, some are monochrome, some are high resolution, some are low resolution, there are some that are an entirely different shape, and others that are entirely different material. Once they are created, you can\u2019t change them. That\u2019s now how we view that puzzle and that\u2019s now how we view the past. \n\nArchaeology has gotten to the point where sites even 100 meters away of the same culture, period, material, etc. that are run by different directors cannot utilize data from each other. That\u2019s if they even produce data depending on their philosophy. In other fields that\u2019s fine, you can repeat your experiments all you want, you can produce niche and specialized research that others can use if they\u2019re interested because it\u2019s repeatable. \n\nIn archaeology it cannot be repeated. The site specific scientific techniques that are created are often only usable at that site, the same with many of the other interpretive or narrative driven excavations. They produce data that is uniquely different than other sites and often, depending on the theoretical leanings of archaeologists, the data is entirely unusable at other sites and can only be published by a single individual who understands that data and that site. \n\nThis is why I think the structure of funding needs to change because these niche PhDs are supporting this ego-driven archaeology where a single individual is often the only person capable of doing that type of research and when they\u2019re gone, it\u2019s gone. \n\nIt would be like if the Janssens created the microscope, used it for a bunch of research on a specimen only they had access to, and then died without anyone else ever making a microscope or learning how to. \n\nIt\u2019s a full disciplinary issue because we only have so much material to work on and once it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone. So it\u2019s not particularly beneficial to the discipline for someone to create a unique technique or interpretation for a niche material or subject that can only be used in that material and subject which will never be reproducible or repeatable.\n\nIf the new research was reproducible and repeatable it wouldn\u2019t be a problem but in archaeology once that material is gone, it\u2019s gone.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ot50fc/normalize_stating_your_country_of_study_or_asking/h6xgivi/"}, "4544": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "jmtd", "Date": 1627542424, "Score": 2, "Body": "Yes I\u2019m part time.

If you go to a relatively large (I went to two public R1 schools that have very good  medical programs\\[Edit for detail: California and Colorado\\]) uni, you will get a pretty nice insurance with nothing you have to pay out of pocket other than a fixed amount for medication (for me, it's always been $5). Unfortunately, you don't have access to Emergency room (which would be an extra $125-$150), or a choice to go to any outside doctor without paying out of pocket. But overall, student health insurance plans are usually the best you can get here with the best coverage and lowest cost out of pocket. If you're getting a PhD, your department will likely cover most of the price you have to pay for the insurance itself (ie, I pay $350/year in my grad program, when it's normally something like $3900? I forget)\n\nI also was on an employer's health insurance for a while (ranked one of the best in US) and had to pay over $2000 throughout the year for healthcare despite being a healthy and active 24 year old. This is on top of the $1560 I paid to get the insurance itself after what my employer pays (\"insurance premium\")\n\nI think when coming to the US, it's most important to understand that healthcare is a commodity here. You are coming to a country that has a relatively underdeveloped healthcare system. You will likely have longer wait times than you are used to, both as a wait time at the doctor's office and if you need to schedule an appointment with a \"specialist\", which can take up to five weeks in my experience. And it will be more likely that a doctor will either not treat you, saying nothing is wrong, or give you an extremely strong medication which will be helpful when you need to go back to your work, but will only treat symptoms. Either way, I just go to my home country when I need major procedures or dental care (ie surgery, root canal, crown, etc), as a flight across the Atlantic and the procedure itself tends to add up to less money, and I get to see my family.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that general first aid is not a part of the American psyche.  People like firefighters, emergency medical personnel, lifeguards, fitness trainers, etc usually have the training. But, in my country we have to get first aid and CPR training as a requirement for a driver's license. So I thought it was weird.\n\nAmerican healthcare is designed to make money for insurance companies. Here are a few terms I didn't know:\n\nCopay: This is what you have to pay out of pocket whenever you get a service. For example, if your insurance states that you have a \"$30 copay for office visits\", you have to pay at least $30 every time when you go to see a doctor.\n\nDeductible: This is the amount of money you have to pay in a year in healthcare costs before your insurance even considers paying for things, as long as it's not preventative care.\n\nOut of pocket maximum: This is the maximum amount of money you'll actively pay in a year. After that, insurance will pay for everything. So kinda for disaster coverage basically.\n\nPremium: The amount of money you have to pay to essentially enroll in insurance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway...

The PI then hires 4-5 students on this grant who need their tuition, salary, insurance, and other workplace expenses paid. Everything gets billed to the account number of that grant including and especially supplies and equipment, even if third party equipment is used, and the student works mostly full time on one of the projects assigned by the professor and publishes in that area over time.

I think that was good in the sense that I had some interests and my advisor recognized that.   So I guess that's one thing.  Have some ideas. \n\nSecond, you should be aware that your classes and professors will dictate a great deal regarding how much you can explore. My first class was really focused on history,  fundamentals, and didn't really give me an opportunity to explore my ideas.  My second class (so calendar-wise we're talking about four months into the program) the professor was a little more encouraging.  She'd let us periodically research our own interests and write about them.  The culminating project for that particular class was a report on something that we found that might be of further interest. That particular project kind of gave me some more focused ideas . . . but keep in mind that since this is the end if my second semester, I'm now taking about eight months and two classes before I found something that made me think it was working. \n\nI tell people it was a shift from \"hey, I think **this** is kind of interesting\" to \"hey, I think this **is** kind of interesting\".\n\nOver the summer my next professor really pushed all of us to pursue our own ideas and research our topics to try to develop our areas of interest further.  Now in my case I kind of had something, and she encouraged me to pursue it.  Other people in my class weren't where I was at yet with regard to their topics,  so they were spending that summer semester figuring out what they wanted to study. \n\nNow here's a key point.  You need to have some idea about how this topic will benefit the world.   How is this research going to help people?  Are there populations that would be helped in any way by this research?  So taking from my own experience,  keep that in the back of your mind, but don't necessarily prioritize the practical application of your research if you don't yet know what that research is.\n\nGoing back to that summer course my professor pushed me to think about how my research could help people.   I found a way.  At the end of that summer course I could tell everyone \"I'm interested in studying this, and I  think it could be used to help a traditionally-underserved population by XYZ\".\n\nKeep in mind,  though, that we are now talking about essentially a solid calendar year for me to be able to even begin to articulate this, and I had professors who were encouraging me to do that.  I had professors give me opportunities to investigate the things I was interested in.\n\nOne last thing. I heard about something called the \"1,000-100 rule of research.  It was something like you needed to read 1,000 articles and write 100 research papers before you are ready for your dissertation\".

I was in my early 20s while all other 4 students were in their late 20s or 30s. No one ever helped me with anything, I was regularly bullied by my labmates. It was just too much for a young girl in super early 20s. I had just moved to a new country (USA), with no friends and no family. I was taking 9-12 credits every semester and was expected to be in lab for at least 40 hours doing research and my stipend was $1000 a month. I was struggling mentally, emotionally and financially. I hit a point where I was just done. 18 months later after I started, I graduated with a master\u2019s degree. I could have probably published 2 papers with all the work I had done. I was incredibly hard working at that time. But the whole experience of dealing with my professor and fellow labmates scarred me so much that I just converted all my work to a dense master\u2019s thesis and graduated.\n\nI started working for a corporate and surprisingly enough my engineering manager this time turned out to be the supervisor of my dreams. The first day at my job, I thought someone adopted me. My coworkers and manager were extremely supportive of me personally and professionally. My supervisor taught me so much about technical writing than anyone ever did in grad school. I was regularly put in preparation of engineering reports, construction documents and specifications. When covid hit, everyone in my team dispersed to various offices and I dont have my old team anymore. But two years later, I am ready to go back to getting my PhD again. This time I have savings, a nice car, good experience to ever come back to industry if I want to, a good network of friends to support me, I am much well adjusted to the country and I know exactly why I want my PhD and what I want out of it. Putting my feet in the water the first time helped me so much. The funny thing is every six months or so, my old professor emails me to ask me if I am ready to come back to PhD under him. Funny he mentions, no I wont ever work under him. \n\nIf the environment is extremely toxic to the point you mentioned, my advice would be to graduate with a masters if you can and put your feet in the industry or try to move labs within university or move to a different university.

I technically have another year before I have to hand in anyway, I just wanted to finish this year but COVID-19 has added to my thesis and working ft and PhD ft has been rather exhausting! So this puts me in a very unique position as well.\n\nFrom what I have read from the Professors sub, this whole imposter syndrome doesn\u2019t just disappear but it can lesson over time, partly because TT is a bit of an anti-climax apparently. I\u2019m getting great feedback from students and academics alike yet I\u2019m questioning myself - I have previously had bullies for line managers and it really does have knock on effects. Found out as I was leaving one job that everyone couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d stuck the job out for as long as I did due to the bullying and jealousy from the person in question. \n\nLuckily there has been no bullying, my line manager has been very supportive and encouraging, jealousy has been ok (until now at least) but there has been something mentioned recently that makes me think there is actually some jealousy around as I\u2019ve suddenly become a \u201cthreat\" stupid really as my area is nothing to do with anyone else in my department - which is partly why I\u2019ve been made permanent already. Hopefully that will not be an issue moving forward but I just have to try and ignore it (though the imposter syndrome makes that a little tricky!)\n\nThere are lots of imposter syndrome resources online as it\u2019s being more talked about now thankfully, but know you are not alone and that it is a very real feeling BUT that doesn\u2019t mean you are an imposter! You would not be TT already if you were not great at what you do!

As my Head of School said, YOU are the expert, we still don\u2019t know everything, but you mostly know more than your students (I get professionals in my classes sometimes so they may have been working in the profession for a number of years so do know more than me in ways but not from the academic side usually). \n\nHave somewhere to reflect on your activities as a TT professional, I\u2019ve found reflecting very helpful and in my case it will help me apply for certain things as an academic that require you to talk about yourself and your teaching impact rather than your research impact.\nPerhaps a personal (but definitely stay at home) journal that you can brain dump into regularly along side a reflection journal. It will help vent those feelings but also allow you to see what you are actually doing for your job. Assuming you know what you should be doing, I bet you will be doing that and more, so make sure you leave work at work and schedule self-care and leisure activities for non-work time.\n\nThank you for sharing here, it\u2019s helpful to know we are not the only ones feeling this way, but there is some things we can do to support ourselves.

She is a stay at home mother and my position has decent funding for a grad student stipend  (~30k/year). I try to be a pretty involved dad, but I recognize that my situation is very different from what mothers go through and I definitely don\u2019t have to work against some of the challenges a mother would face. \n\nOne factor in our decision to have kids was that as a PhD student, I\u2019m essentially planning to pursue a career in a relatively competitive and high-stress environment (even though I intend to leave academia).  Doing a PhD is stressful, but I\u2019m not really convinced that the stress I feel now is significantly greater than stress I may have down the road. Life is hard (and short), and different stages bring different challenges.\n\nA related factor, and something someone else mentioned, is the flexibility that grad school allows. My schedule is incredibly flexible, especially since I\u2019ve been working from home during the whole pandemic. My PI doesn\u2019t track my hours and is a very kind and supportive man. My future employers may not provide that kind of support. Especially in the US, where maternity/paternity leave options are pretty variable.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that even on my relatively good stipend (compared to other programs), money can be tight. We work to budget and be responsible, and there are a lot of social programs that help make it manageable. Together, my wife and I have 13 years of college education (including bachelors), but we only have about $10k total in student loans and have been pretty fortunate with scholarships and employment (going to a very inexpensive undergrad university and working all through school does wonders). Money would obviously be less tight if we waited to have kids until after I finish, but honestly, our financial situation seems pretty good compared to a lot of the stories I see on here. We were even able to buy a used mini van earlier this year with cash, in preparation for having twins.\n\nAnother benefit I\u2019ve found is that playing with my daughter is the ultimate de-stressor. It\u2019s pretty difficult to feel stressed about work while rolling on the ground or acting like a horse. Especially during the pandemic, when many of my classmates have spent untold hours in relative solitude with a roommate, I feel particularly grateful for the support system I have at home. Taking care of, and being with, my family helps give me perspective and helps remind me that the problems I face in research really aren\u2019t the world-ending issues that they sometimes feel like. Even things like doing laundry, making them food, or doing dishes help keep me grounded in reality rather than being stuck in my head. They help me remember that there is a lot more to life than my small niche of imperfect research. \n\nThat being said, having kids is a big commitment that never goes away. I wouldn\u2019t try to convince someone else to do it, because if they need convincing, then maybe now isn\u2019t the right time them. Maybe it never will be a right time for them, and that\u2019s fine too.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ou4rti/women_who_had_a_child_during_the_phd_is_there_a/h73xrpm/"}, "4793": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "aledaml", "Date": 1627667967, "Score": 2, "Body": "If you know you want to stay at the current university you may want to look up faculty profiles and see what they're currently studying.
