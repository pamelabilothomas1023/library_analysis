I'm based in the sciences and had a little journey to get here. I applied for PhDs straight out of undergrad, to the usual kind of suspects (Imperial/UCL/Oxbridge etc) but was rejected from all but one in Vienna, which I decided not to take as felt the project wasn't a perfect fit (although the money was great!). I was applying with firsts throughout my undergrad and achieved the overall highest grade for my course. I then stayed on at UCL and did a MSc in a related field to become a little more specialised; after which I decided to apply for PhDs again. This time I was offered interviews at all my choice universities (apart from Edinburgh.. not bitter..) and had rigorous interviews from all. However, Cambridge in particular was challenging as I not only had my Cambridge academic interviews, but also interviews with both my industrial sponsor and research council.\n\nAfter all that, it took around 2-3 months to hear that I had been accepted at Cambridge AND that the project funding was secured (two different things).\n\nThis was a little bit of a ramble. But just to say, that you can graduate from undergrad with great grades, extra stuff on your CV, be the captain of the rugby team, but ultimately experience counts (for a lab based PhD anyway). So, don't give up if applying straight from undergrad doesn't work out!\n\nI was/still am 22 years old when I started. I think the reason I got the PhD was just perseverance i.e. a continued interest in wanting to do a PhD from before graduation/after/MSc etc; you've got to show your hunger (for the interviews at least!). Also, great grades don't hurt! :)\n\nThe only regret I have is having to split my time between an academic and my industrial environment - it's making it a little tricky to meet any like-minded PhD students, and Cambridge isn't well known for having the most sociable students.. haha.\n\nTake home message: apply, re-apply, get experience, try again and you will definitely get there!

I'm not going to lie...I was declined at most, but I did get into my preferred choice was able to go on to get a masters and PhD in my true passion (discipline in glaciology and geophysics).  It was a little eye opening my first day of grad school when in my first class (dynamics), the prof started scribbling differential equations on the board.  I hadn't looked at math like that in over 8 years.  I spun it back up quickly though and managed to do just fine.\n\nHonestly, the hardest part of it was going from thinking like an engineer, to thinking like a scientist again.  This can be very hard.  Part of most PhD programs involves passing a candidacy or qualifying exam where you must write one or two scientific proposals that pose a valid/testable hypothesis. You must then defend those proposals and show that they correctly apply the scientific method, and that you can think like a scientist.  I barely eeked out a passing result at my candidacy because I had such a hard time re-training my brain to not think like exclusively like an engineer.  But now...I feel I'm a more well-rounded scientist because of my deeper breadth of experiences and knowledge bases.\n\nTwo other quick things:  You'll probably spend your first year taking classes while you prep for your candidacy exam.  Then, once officially a candidate, you'll begin working on your research project.  I might suggest that you pursue a masters degree first.  I know in the end it means doing slightly more work, but I thought it was worth it.  It game me the time and opportunity to see if I really wanted to continue on with a PhD.

You're not really getting a PhD in \"business administration\" even if your diploma says that-you're getting a PhD in accounting, finance, marketing, international business, etc.\n\nIf you have a science background and don't want to do accounting or finance, you might look into information systems. It's not computer science-it's information systems and is under the business school umbrella at a lot of institutions. \n\nThat being said, my undergrad was in mechanical engineering. There's lots of business PhD's with other-subject bachelor's degrees-I'd say about 50% of them. But it's not something you should approach lightly-make sure it's something you actually want to do! PhD is not an MBA in any way, shape or form. If you want to go into management, a PhD isn't going to do much for you. If you want to go into academia, a PhD is required! \n\nThe level of school absolutely matters! The best candidates go to the best schools, and the rest trickle down. Some schools only take two or three students in any given year-they make a list of applicants they want to offer, then offer the top 3. If one of those top 3 reject the offer, then they move to #4 and so on until their class is filled out. \n\nSince your degree is in a non-business discipline, the schools are going to try really hard to make sure you actually want to do research in the chosen business area you're applying for. It's understandable to not have research topics lined out or anything, but study the areas and at least know what kind of research is being published in the area. You won't get in anywhere if it's clear you're just applying because you can't think of anything better to do. \n\nAlso, you can get a pretty cheap MBA if you do well on the GMAT and get a teaching assistanceship at a state school. It won't be a Harvard MBA, but there are lots of public universities with regionally respected MBA programs that can get you in the door with a lot of companies.

It's a bit out of date, but it gives some insight into what the \"typical\" experience is. The median age for a Math PhD is among the lowest, at 30.3. \nhttp://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf06312/#fn5 . \n\nBut even though the median age for Math is low, there is variation. At least half of the recipients were 30.3 or older. I completed my Math PhD when I was 40. It was in Mathematical Statistics, with a minor in Real Analysis, and from one of the AMS Group I (Public) schools (http://www.ams.org/profession/data/annual-survey/group_i).\n\n( At my school, there were two stats programs, one in biostats in the School of Public Health and the other in math stats, in the Dept. of Math, Stat and Comp. Sci. In my department, all of the PhDs are in \"Mathematics\", whether in pure or applied math, mathematical statistics or mathematical computer science. )\n\nI majored in Psychology as an undergrad. After graduating, I started working for three professors at a medical school and realized that I enjoyed statistical programming, so I started work on a master's degree in statistics 4 years after completing my BA. I worked full time and did my graduate school coursework part-time. I loved it. After 3 years, including taking prerequisites that most math grad students would have completed as undergrads, I completed the Master's, which was all that I had initially aspired to. But I had done very well on my exams and was invited to try for a PhD. Balancing work and coursework was tough, but if you really enjoy studying and doing research in the area, I think it can be done. I'm very satisfied with the decision to pursue both graduate degrees. Math is a beautiful area. \nG.H. Hardy wrote, \"No mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than any other art or science, is a young man's game.\" But that view comes from an earlier (and more sexist) time and has been challenged.

I did both my Masters and Phd at Penn State, although in Geosciences, not Computer Science (although my undergraduate BS was in Computer Engineering).\n\nThe graduate program at PSU is tough.  Normal expectation in the sciences is that you take classes for the first year (if coming in without a masters), and then in the fall of your 2nd year you are \"expected\" to take your candidacy exam.  Many people end up pushing it back until the spring though...although it's \"frowned upon\".  I can't speak for CS, but in Geosciences, the Candidacy exam was the worst of any milestone...even worse than my eventual dissertation defense.  It's at the candidacy that they decide your fate, and where your committee can legitimately kick you out of the program.  I had to write two proposals (one my actual proposal, and one something I came up with completely on my own), and then for 3 hours your committee asks you anything they want.  And I mean ANYTHING.  They will get you to the point when you say \"I don't know\" - no matter how much you studied, and then that's when the gloves come off.  They asked me to derive first principle equations on the board, asked me to talk about all the ways I might address the fact that \"i didn't know\".  I had to prove I could think like a scientist and pose valid hypotheses.  It was incredibly stressful, and leaving my exam, I felt like the stupidest person in the world.  They told me I passed, but it was \"a squeaker\".  It kind of reminded me of that annoying kid friend we all had that just kept asking \"but why\"...\"but why\"....\"but why\"....ad nauseum.\n\nRegarding timing.  I feel like my department was a little more forgiving for people without masters degrees.  I did a masters first, so when I picked back up in the fall to start my PhD, not only did I have a masters, but I had one from PSU.  This meant I had to do my Candidacy in my first semester since many of my classes overlapped.  With folks coming in right out of undergrad into the PhD, like I said, many were able to push their exam back to their 4th semester.  For me, I just wanted to know sooner rather than later if I would stay on as a student.  If I failed, I had no intention of trying again.\n\nTwo years after your candidacy, you then take your comprehensive exam, which is also stressful, but not like the candidacy.  After that, your All But Done until your defense.  Oh and there's that pesky little business of actually writing up your 3-5 chapter dissertation of course ;-)\n\nHope this helps.

For me I still feel stupid about my area of research and I have half our lab coming to me for advice on it so this is relatively normal.\n\nSecond, try to understand how you are presenting things because often times defining the problem well is enough to allow yourself to talk about something in a much more articulate way.  Try doing your best to explain the problem and then address these 3 points whenever you talk about what you are doing:\n\n* Why is this important\n* Why is this hard\n* Why is this interesting\n\nAfter you have done that you may find it easier to move on to what you did, why you did it, and what challenges you still face.

What seems to be getting funded frequently? \n\nI found for myself, there were two main areas I was struggling to choose between and part way through this year one of them just started making more sense in terms of my non-academic career, fit in the department, relevance in my area of subject, etc. ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_4h1jth.json"}, "148": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "phddumbdumb", "Date": 1461981356, "Score": 2, "Body": "It sucks that you've had to put up with him...even with some cultural/language barriers he should have understood that consistent \"no\" responses actually means no. The politics of your department make it more complicated, but think of it like any job/workplace. He's not being appropriate and if you're going to have to work with him in the future it's likely best to confront him. I'm a bit over-cautious about this type of thing, so if it was me I'd probably alert the department chair about my concerns or at least school HR. You could even bring it up without naming him, asking hypothetically what the department/schools response to that type of situation is. You might not be the only person he's harassing/ed, or if it happens again you bringing this up could be really helpful. Particularly since you say he's the top in your field, it's a good idea to have the school informed/ready to support you. \n\nHowever, if you'd rather not go to someone higher up it is a good idea to plan out a very, VERY clear statement to say to him in a neutral, public setting and not when he's asking you out (ideally with another person present...maybe someone neutral-ish like his housemate). Something along the lines of \"Hey, I want to talk to you about something to clear things up because we work together and I want to have a good work environment. When you ask me out/try to buy me drinks/etc. I have clearly said no. I'm sure you are trying to be friendly but when you continue to ask me out after I've said no, or force me to dance with you, I feel uncomfortable and don't think it's appropriate for a coworker to interact with me like that. Please stop doing the things I brought up.\" \n\n*hug* good luck...it's a shitty situation. \n", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_4g2mfe.json"}, "149": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ShadowHunter", "Date": 1462041999, "Score": 2, "Body": "Nearly all business PhDs provide a living stipend. I am not sure why would you want to get a second PhD since you can easily make more working while doing same thing as you were in your PhD. Your degrees are professional. PhD is not a collection of classes, like MBA or JD. It's about research. Finally, there are a few people with two PhDs, but I fully expect that no good school will accept you in the PhD program after you already have two.
