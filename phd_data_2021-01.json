I used to have the worst periods known to woman kind.  If I skipped a lab period where I'd be on my feet all day because my knees felt like exploding I would hate myself.  Sometimes I would become so guilty about my \"laziness\" that I would down some heavy painkillers, get sort of buzzed, down a shit ton of espresso and work myself into a fugue state. \n\nPart of the reason I tortured myself like this is because my father is my role model and he has an astounding work ethic.  My dad's a blue collar worker, tradesmen, union guy.  He works a physically punishing job that has been slowly devouring his body WHILE living with multiple permanent disabilities.  My Dad never missed a child support payment and the guy needed to get diagnosed with a fucking tumour before he took a break.  Whenever I got my periods, I would sit in bed hating myself and thinking, \"Dad doesn't have periods.  But if Dad did have a period he wouldn't let that stop him.  Stop being such a little whiny cunt.  Get up.  This isn't as bad as what Dad goes through everyday you stupid bitch.  Dad watches people die at work and you're upset because your supervisor blasted vaporized mercury in your face?  Grow up, faggot.  Pull yourself up.\"\n\nThat was basically my personal monologue until I graduated.  Then I sat down with my Dad and he starts gushing about how proud he is of me.  How he could barely spell but \"you can read better than anyone I know\".  He started talking about how hard it must have been for me as \"a little girl\" (referring to my stature) \"living in the big city taking care of yourself and doing all that hard work\".  My Dad actually felt I was pushing myself too hard and wanted me to take a break.  So I did.  I sat on my ass and got high all day and then I started seeing a psychiatrist.\n\nThe point of this personal diatribe is not to satiate my narcissitic desire to talk about myself.  The point is that I don't know why you feel guilty, but guilt isn't rational.  I don't know if you have parents like mine who inspire you so much that you hate yourself for falling short.  I don't know if you have imposter's syndrome.  All I know if you have a negative feeling and it's preventing you from taking a little break.  That to me speaks of some greater emotional problem than just a resilient work ethic.  I'm not saying you're a head-case like me, only that if you stopped and asked the people you loved about the things you feel guilty about, chances are they would say that they're proud of you and that they love you.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kohikf/feeling_guilty/ghsoxhl/"}, "118": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "Birdman_a15", "Date": 1609564203, "Score": 3, "Body": "Imposter syndrome is real.

Maybe putting it in words can help you or myself in some way.\n\nThe whole barrier between enjoying something and dreading it can be the finest line, but really it is all based on outlook. When you feel you have to do something, you are stressed about it, you are behind, or there is general negative feelings towards your task, it can be immensely overwhelming. Its all just a perspective though. If you are looking forward to it, or set small goals and congratulate yourself, you're ahead of your work, or often feeling positively towards your task, working can be amazing.\n\nThis all is solely on our heads. It can be illustrated if you think about two walks. Imagine walking when you are late for a meeting where people will be waiting on you. The whole walk there may feel bad, you may be saying bad things to yourself in your head, but you still are just walking(maybe quickly). On the other hand, imagine walking when you finish a day and accomplish some big goal(maybe getting the data you've been trying for), and maybe your advisor compliments you on your work. You may enjoy it more, with no rush or stress on needing to be more then what you are. \n\nThe actions are the same but the mental world is different. Most of us have habits ingrained from our culture to put us into stress mode the second something isn't perfect, even if we have been trying hard. Academics tend to solve problems and think hard, so if something isn't right, we exhaust mental effort to change this. \n\nNow this is where my thoughts are unfinished. There's mental work to be done such as mindfulness, meditation, self-kindness, but isn't that all something to be stressed about not doing enough too?

I didn't always like my industry job, but I felt that getting a PhD could help me find a job I liked more in research and development. I like where I am now compared to before.\n\nI don't think my industry experience helped with the research one but. My advisor way well connected in his particular industry, though, so our research had feedback from industry professionals who wanted us to have an eye for relevant research that could be useful for industry applications, rather than just focusing on the theory and things that aren't practically possible to scale up. I guess in saying that, having the industry experience helps with understanding that feedback from first hand experience, but the people we worked with were great mentors.\n\nThe best advantage my industry experience had was finding a job after graduation. The job I have now liked that I had previous work experience and wasn't \"just an academic\". It helped me acclimate to the work environment. Not saying others can't, but they felt like it was \"less risky\" I guess for a fit.\n\nYeah, having money is a good thing. You really shouldn't go for a PhD if you can't get it funded by your advisor, because it isn't hard to find that (at least in my experience as an engineering student), but you don't really get paid much as a grad student on a grant or assistantship.\n\nAll said, I don't know if I'd recommend it, just depends on what your goals are.

Just. My viva was destined to be awful.\n\n1. I rewrote the entire thesis in the preceding 6 months. All 100k words of it.\n2. The night before, I went out for sushi and drinks, stayed in an unfamiliar apartment, and woke up without my usual morning cuppa.\n3. I wore a suit. I very rarely wear suits. I would have been much more comfortable in a nice jacket, shirt and jeans.\n4. Morning of, I showed up nice and early, had a coffee, and settled down. It was graduation day, so my friends were all showing up for graduation: my viva had been delayed by the examiners, who were out of the country and didn't want to do a skype viva. So plenty thought I was already graduating, and there was a whole heap of added pressure from everyone knowing it was viva time. They're private in the UK, and only a handful of people had known my date.\n5. 2 minutes before the start, the chair shows up. No sign of the examiners, but I figured they'd be in the cafe over the road, and I wasn't going to disturb them. Turns out they weren't.\n6. 15 minutes after the start time, the examiners show up. I'm nervous as hell by this point, and had been pacing the corridor to try and find something to do. Drinking copious amounts of coffee hadn't helped. For reference, I used to do a lot of theatre. Never had nerves like that, but then my audience had always shown up.\n7. They ask if I want a few minutes, or to jump right in. I opted for B. Don't opt for B. Take a few.\n8. Question 1: This doesn't read like a continuous argument, more of a 'Studies in...', which is fine, but I'm curious how you went about collecting the evidence. Easy enough question, about methodology, and simple for me to answer. I'd spent the first year performing a comprehensive, published database, and didn't decide on the argument until I had catalogued several thousand entries. My original proposal was chucked to one side, and a new line of thinking was created, with a general feel of an argument/structure. That's what I wish I'd said. I actually said that I'd come up with an argument, and then found the evidence to suit. Which is a) an awful way to go about it, and b) not true in the slightest. So we're off to a rocky start.\n9. It all spiralled from there. The examiners used words and theories that I didn't know, and I admitted ignorance too many times and started to bluff. I defended things I should have given ground on, and surrendered on things I should have fought. The translation of one particular word, for example, didn't matter. Except for the 10 minutes that I vigorously defended it.\n\nAnyway, they call me back in, tell me it's a thesis, advise me against pursuing a career in academia, or trying to publish the thesis, and pass me with minor corrections (3 months). 5 months later, my corrections get approved just in time for graduation, and I get a postdoc the day before I graduate. Within a year I have a book contract, and am actually grateful for the viva. My answers were my responsibility, and I fluffed most of them. They could have failed me, and I am glad that they didn't.\n\nBut I still look at the external's twitter feed and get irked that they stopped to take a photo and tweet about a statue while already late for my viva.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ko4bpe/a_little_positivity_to_ring_in_the_new_year/ghygmkh/"}, "477": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "cation587", "Date": 1609685919, "Score": 2, "Body": "Nothing works", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kpctew/summarize_your_experience_as_a_phd_graduate/ghygt9v/"}, "478": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "artemisiamorisot", "Date": 1609686306, "Score": 3, "Body": "Emotional rollercoaster, I\u2019m so dumb.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kpctew/summarize_your_experience_as_a_phd_graduate/ghyhil2/"}, "479": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "overlapping_gen", "Date": 1609687406, "Score": 5, "Body": "Shit that doesn\u2019t look good at all", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kpctew/summarize_your_experience_as_a_phd_graduate/ghyjotm/"}, "480": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "RyebreadEngine", "Date": 1609687560, "Score": 2, "Body": "Same here!

A PhD is best looked at as an internship to be an academic.  You spend years reading about a very specific thing and learning how to conduct research to answer a very specific question.  You have a moderate amount of guidance and then you go through peer review (dissertation defense) to make sure you produced something of academic worth.  After that internship (the PhD), you look for post-doc jobs (entry level position) and keep doing what you did for the PhD (with less supervision each time) until a University feels ok about hiring you and that you can keep doing quality research over and over without supervision.  If you keep it up long enough, you might get tenure.\n\nIf you just want to move up in a new career that you switched to in your 40s, get a master's degree in that field.  The only exceptions would probably be if you were certain you wanted to work in R&amp;D, which might require a PhD (although a master's with thesis is probably sufficient for most R&amp;D jobs), or if the new field required licensing like clinical psychology where you need a PhD.\n\nSo if you want that internship to be an academic, that's basically the PhD, and you should go for it.  If your goal is something other than academia, why would you do a 3+ year internship in something else (the PhD)?\n\nBeing older won't drastically change your chances of getting into a program, honestly.  Most of what matters is how able the university thinks you are to be able to produce academic quality research.  If you can demonstrate that you will likely produce good research, you won't have a problem getting in somewhere.  Having years of experience delivering on-time projects, giving presentations, learning on the job, etc... are all valuable skills when doing research and are all things an older applicant can demonstrate.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ixdndz/online_versus_inperson_phd/ghyxz1a/"}, "511": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "thedicestoppedrollin", "Date": 1609693853, "Score": 6, "Body": "What am I even doing?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kpctew/summarize_your_experience_as_a_phd_graduate/ghyy038/"}, "512": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1609694395, "Score": 1, "Body": "This might sound dumb, but what kind of sustainability are we talking?

I have had access to counseling and psychiatric care, and have made a lot of progress on day-to-day self care through medical help and routine practices, but the environment (physical and political) of the town that I am in for my PhD contributes to my mental health issues, and the economic stressors of living on a threadbare stipend make things worse too (such as, when I had the cancer scare and needed expensive testing that I couldn't afford even with insurance - I still haven't gotten the genetic testing I was supposed to do, and won't be able to until I get a better paying job).

Money was tight for us even though I had a pretty decent stipend (35k) and my husband had a well-paying job.\n-in my experience, you MUST have a childcare provider. You cannot watch the baby AND do research. This may be different since I was doing lab work and couldn't bring the baby in the lab, but I really think it's hard to concentrate on research while watching a baby. I recommend budgeting for daycare, a nanny, or a very dedicated grandparent to watch your baby at least 4 days a week so you can get work done.\n-you will miss out on 50-75% of networking activities because they are scheduled during daycare pick up.\n-you will likely not get paid maternity leave, but it might be possible to negotiate a good long unpaid leave. I had my baby in May and took the summer off unpaid. See earlier point about having a spouse/partner with a good income.\n-student health insurance is often crap for \"grown-up\" conditions like pregnancy and you will likely have to go outside of health services for treatment. I spent about 5 hours every other week fighting with my insurance company to get them to cover basic stuff like ultrasounds and prenatal screenings. If you can get on better insurance before getting pregnant, do it. You won't regret it.\n-it WILL add 6 months to a year to your PhD. I lost about a year, between morning sickness, third trimester fatigue, maternity leave, time spent pumping in the office, and time lost to things life doctors appointments, childcare falling through, etc. You may be luckier or you may be less fortunate and lose even more time.\n\nOverall, I am 50/50 on whether or not I'd do it again given the choice. It was really really REALLY hard. My mental health was total crap. I almost quit several times. But I also think it was the right time for me and my husband to have a baby, so I guess I'm glad I did it. But I also think that no one should do it unless they are ABSOLUTELY 100% sure that they want to have a baby now and not later.\n\nYou need to make your peace with the idea that you will more likely quit your PhD after having a baby.

Well, that didn't work so I'll just deal with the repercussions of leaving mid-semester if it happens.\n\nLook at maternity leave in your program, department, and how your supervisor has treated pregnancy for past students. As a student, pregnancy is protected through Title IX (in the US) so you have to be given reasonable accommodation. Some schools offer maternity leave through short term disability (requires a year to qualify), some offer a semester leave (unpaid or paid). The programs (in stem) that I've encountered don't have any official written protocol for pregnancy or leave. Some schools offer childcare for students' kids on a sliding scale (i.e. payment is based on income)...

Childcare is very expensive in my area. How much is childcare in your area (or the area you want to further study in)? Housing? Is there access to cheaper but still quality housing and childcare through your school? How does your stipend work? In my case, it\u2019s not exactly a stipend, but more like guaranteed work as a GA and/or TA. If I do a minimum of 20hrs/week of this work at my school, I get free healthcare, and can pay to cover additional family members. I cover my whole family, because it\u2019s very good insurance at a much cheaper price than would otherwise be available.

It wouldn\u2019t even come close.\n\nThe flexibility is fantastic though. We went without childcare from the start of the pandemic in the US.

My male professors never mentioned it once and while they were almost avoidant, I never felt ignored or discriminated against. I was never the first person they'd ask to handle work, but my advisor was also pregnant so it was something that strengthened our relationship which evened things out in my mind. Though returning to school and studying during maternity leave was a challenge because I was so tired and my priorities had shifted so drastically, it was really a matter of finding a new normal and managing my own expectations. \n\nNow that I'm not pregnant, I don't mention my child much. I talk about her when asked, but in general, I try to keep that aspect of my life separate since I'm working with mostly older men. I am the only parent with a young child in the program (others have teens or older), but people have been generally supportive when they find out. \n\nI absolutely could not survive on a stipend. Full stop. So I work full time, and pay my own way through the program. Every other parent I know at the school in different programs have a spouse who supplements their stipend income.

Some schools explicitly advise against contacting the faculty.\n\nBut, even if we don't contact the faculty, we are still expected to know who are the potential advisors at each school, and the work they do. \n\n2 -  This is a problem really. You should have developed close relationships during your MS to get at least 3 letters. Letters of recommendation are very important for business PhD applications. And they should come from people who really know about academic research, so they can evaluate your potential to become a researcher in academia. Work-based references usually are not able to do that. \n\nSome applicants try to contact professors to become research assistants, so they can improve networking and get letters. \n\n3 - For business schools, any program in the top 20 range is usually considered a crapshoot, even for very strong applicants. I don't know how you're classifying a college as top tier, but be very careful about using ranks. They can be very misleading, especially if they are more related to undergrad/masters, and not PhDs. Every time I see a list with only big names I get the feeling the applicant didn't do a good job at making an appropriate school selection. \n\nA top school may be a terrible choice, and a lower-ranked school may be an excellent choice. That depends on a lot of factors, like the research fit. Also, it's quite common to see top researchers preferring to work for lower-ranked school, where they can have more influence and freedom to do their work.\n\nGood grades and GRE scores usually mean that your application is not going to be desktop rejected, and they are used as an initial filter. But they are not enough to get an offer, no matter how good they are. \n\n4 - Without making things too complex, these tend to be the characteristics of a very strong application for business PhDs (it's not common to have all of them, but you should have many of them):\n\n\\- Very high GPA. \n\nThere are lots of applicants with perfect GPAs, or close to it. \n\n\\- Very high GRE/GMAT. \n\nSomething like 90% is quite common, so it would not make you stand out. Sometimes, 90% might be considered the minimum required, although maybe not for organizational behavior.  \n\nMy college is not at the same level of the ones you mentioned, and still the average GMAT of accepted applicants is around 720 (94%) if I remember correctly. \n\n\\- Strong and positive letters of recommendation, from professors who are active researchers with a good reputation. \n\n\\- Research experience. This can include experience working as a research assistant, papers published, and conference presentations.\n\n\\- A strong statement of purpose. \n\nYour SoP should show you know what you're getting into, and that you're committed to it. \n\nIt also should also show you and the college are a great match, that the college is the right choice for you, and you are the right choice for the college. Anyone can say that Harvard is an amazing school, but not everyone is able to convince Harvard about being a great match. After all, there are many amazing schools, so why Harvard and not the other ones? \n\n\\- A good school selection\n\nBusiness PhD programs are very competitive, with people applying to a large number of schools to improve their chances of being accepted somewhere. \n\nThe strongest applicants typically make a list out of the top 50 programs, with less strong applicants increasing the range to top 70 or top 100. There are still great programs in that range, it's not like a rank for master's. \n\nMy guess is that people typically made a list of 15 schools on average, but I've seen that number increasing after the pandemic.

I was very fortunate to have a well-paid partner, education benefits, the stipend, and extra money from freelancing. My mom helped me watch her for the first year, while I breastfed/pumped in my car or bathrooms 2857927 times a day, and then we put her in daycare. Daycare is very expensive... 600-800/month at least. Also, you need to purchase all kinds of extra things, like maternity clothes, nursery items, a stroller, car seat, diapers, wipes, breast pump supplies OR formula, baby clothes, baby toys. Constant cleaning, cooking, messy body (you and baby), and just juggling your responsibilities take a pretty big toll on your physical and mental health; grad school can also take a toll on your mental health, so doubling up on grad school and new motherhood means you\u2019ll have a lot on your plate. Even with daycare and help from my mom and spouse, it was a huge struggle to get everything done. I often found myself reading research or writing essays on my cellphone in the middle of the night so I could keep up. I finished the MA with a 4.0, got a full-time job right before I graduated, applied for the second MA, got pregnant again, and recently accepted a full-time instructor position.

Even if you never read the comments, getting it out will help in the short term. \n\nTo give you some advice mixed with experience, you need to do 4 things. \n\n1) Schedule your time and also structure your day. Wake up at a certain time. Schedule the whole day out in hour blocks. If it's all reading, schedule the reading topics. \n\nWrite it down on actual paper. With a pen. Then just follow it. If it's not done, rewrite it for the next day. \n\n2) When I did my MS and start of my PhD, I spent 3 months doing nothing but reading. Reading everything related to my topic, even stuff somewhat related. If you aren't well read, you won't know the gap in your field and the direction you can go. \n\nI only have an understanding of what experiments I should do because I've read hundreds and hundreds of papers and none of them \n\nA) use the materials I use in the way I use them and\n\nB) test the material the way I test it \n\nI only know that cause I literally read hundreds of direct and related papers. \n\nSince you have a thesis topic, start at the beginning. The founding papers, all the various methods machine learning can be done. Make PowerPoints and have them be simple enough to explain to an outsider \n\nWhat is machine learning, why is it important, what are the main problems, what do YOU think is a big problem, and how can you improve it. \n\nThen just find papers to answer each question. Again, devote three months of reading, just at least for three hours every day 5 days a week you are just reading and making notes. Learning your field. \n\nEDIT: This is what you want to do to find your niche in the field. Once you find your niche topic, you can develop expertise in it and *that's* how you market yourself after graduation. So my niche topic is direct ink writing of gels. That includes the actual procedure, gel synthesis, and gel testing through multiple ways. \n\nSo now, with these skills, I can just *apply that to any new formulation and have something interesting to talk about.* So what do you think I'm gonna focus on in a job interview? A PhD who knows how to synthesize/test/apply new gels. Now, my thesis is just a big document showing how I learned how to do it from beginner to expert. \n\nIMO, this is a good way to think about your PhD experience going in. It helps you structure your time/effort in a productive way with an end goal. \n\n3) Really talk with your advisor when you go a certain direction to make sure you're not wasting time. \n\nAfter you have read a bit, just talk with them about what you learned.  Like a book club. Hell, just bring the most interesting paper you read and share the findings. Make it a bi-monthly thing. \n\n4) Exercise. Go run every day. No excuses. If you do not exercise your body WILL FUNCTION LIKE SHIT. And your brain is right there with it. No excuses. Put on shoes, run outside till you're sweating. Come back in. Do it every day and you will see benefits in your life.\n\n---\n\nThese things are simple but they have to be done, especially early on if you're lost. My advisor isn't really hands on and I had to take it upon myself to make myself the expert in our building. Nobody will help you, you have to structure your day and push yourself to be the best you can be. My motivation was : we have a lot of presentations.

It's okay to let our emotions flow.\n\nSecond, it's okay to not be productive sometimes, and not to have results always. Sometimes they just take longer.\n\nThird, try other therapists, until you find one that clicks with you. And try to have an open-mind. Personally, I was not into the talking about myself and my problems, since I already spent a lot of time on this by myself, but doing it with someone else helped me see them from a different perspective.\n\nFourth, asides from therapy, you may also need a psychiatrist to further support you with medication. Psychologists and psychiatrists imo are complementary, and deal with different aspects of mental health, so you should check out both.\n\nFifth, give yourself some time to reset. During that time try to do what others have suggested, begin making up schedules for even simple stuff like doing chores and certain relaxing activities, exercising, etc. I also suggest taking time for just relaxation. Try to get a habit for all of those, then, incorporate your work into those initial workless routines.\n\nFinally, related to research, you definitely need two things: better methodology and communication with your advisor.

In my PhD, my supervisor gave me my first project, I did that and published it, and from there I could see the knowledge gaps in our relatively small field and knew what to work on next by myself. I also helped other people in the group with their projects and ended up on lots of papers.\n\nWhat I've learned is that academia works because each person takes a small section of a large field and focuses entirely on that so they don't get overwhelmed. That's why we have advisors, so they can give us a thread to pull on based on what they've already been doing. Yes you need to read papers to find solutions to problems along the way, but general \"reading to understand a field\" is very difficult and eventually demotivating.\n\nAs a practical scientist, to me machine learning looks like a tool to solve certain types of problem, e.g. how to predict protein 3D structure from amino acid sequence. Even if you develop a new method in ML, unless you demonstrate its use in solving a particular problem, it won't have broad interest (or high impact). So you're better off using what you think are simpler/easier methods to solve new types of problem than developing complex approaches that make only minor improvements on existing methods. \n\nDon't underestimate the value of applying *some* knowledge of ML solutions to a problem that practical scientists find challenging because they know *nothing* about ML. Maybe write down the types of data sets you can work on then try and connect with someone in a totally different department (preferably one that generates lots of data) and see if you can be of use to them?\n\nOtherwise, don't stress about using \"routine\" methods for the projects your supervisor suggests.

However, I'm in my 3rd year so I may as well finish it. \n\nIn terms of generating important/novel/revolutionary/(insert other buzzwords here) research questions, I think you should just accept that whatever research you do now will not change the world.  Think of research as a career rather than a project. It's more than okay to start small. Even if you think that the paper you're working on at the moment is not that important, or novel, just finish it and get it published. If not for the contribution to the field, do it for selfish reasons to kick start your career. If you can't publish it in a peer-reviewed journal, publish it as a blog.

No matter how bad you think your work is, just get it out there and you'll probably find out that it's better than you think.\n\nMy PhD is in health so this may not make sense but can you use your knowledge of ML methods for real-life data/problems? If there's a particular method you're interested in that has already been published, can you use it on real-life data to answer a research question that hasn't been answered yet? In that case, it doesn't matter that the algorithm isn't new, what matters is that you're using it to answer actual questions. If you're struggling in finding novel questions, there's so much to be explored when it comes to examining the effect of COVID19. I'm biased towards health data (pandemic is not just about the disease itself but also about the implications on every other aspect of health and healthcare), but any kind of data may be useful. Can you use your expertise to quantify the effect of lockdown on specific aspects of education provision; map the spread of disease/side effects; predict the effect on average household income in specific areas? If there's something you're particularly interested in outside of ML maybe you can combine the two? \n\nI regret doing a PhD. Especially that I do it in a subject I have no interest in.

Now I feel like my projects aren't good enough for him and feel stuck again reading papers for more \"high impact\" research ideas, whatever that means. I'm worried that I won't have any first author papers by the time I graduate because my PI just won't take a look at my future manuscripts, which has been the case for quite a few people in the lab.

This is just my experience with things:\n\n1. Corona. I started last spring, and I haven't had much in opportunities to be social, or get to know the other phd students. I'd love to, because I know how much I rely on peer-feedback to perform well, and generally get excited about my topic. I personally need that face-to-face social interactions to \"get it\", and stay hyped about what I do.\n2. If you have a good situation going with your supervisor, you should go talk to them. I know it feels awkward, but it would probably help. If you don't want to reveal the exact detail, you could limit it to how you feel about your situation where you are. Tell him that you feel lonely, and that you aren't connecting with your topic (and whatever other factors are making you want to switch). If you do decide to take the new offer, you're still going to have to talk to him eventually.\n3. This might not be a popular opinion, but being 'passionate' about your job is unrealistic. If you're actively unhappy, then yes, I'd agree that switching is a good idea. But like anything you do for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, you're not going to be able to maintain that passion and love for it (unless you're a rare unicorn, in which case; I'm super jealous).

I ask because I feel having these vents-sessions every week with a professional is very helpful. It also has the added bonus that a psychologist can notice underlying problems that we usually don\u2019t. In my case, I required too much of myself and I would punish me when I didn\u2019t meet my unrealistic conditions. I made a vicious cycle of punishment and demotivation. \n\nAlso, some things to that I always try to keep track: did you try taking some time off to recharge your batteries? are you sleeping enough, eating good food, and exercising? I ask because for me whenever I don\u2019t pay attention to these things my motivation decreases.\n\nAlso, I need some kind of system to keep me motivated. Right now I use Trello and Clockify to keep track of what I did, what I am doing, and what I want to do. This way I feel much more in control of things. \n\nFinally, you are not alone. I almost gave up on my PhD last week because I was tired. The PhD is hard (it shouldn\u2019t be but we have this mysticism around it that you should do all alone, but let\u2019s not get into this) so it is normal that some times we are demotivated.\n\nSomething someone very dear to me said last week \u201cyes, the PhD is hard, but the only people that get to be called a doctor are the ones that made through it\u201d.

So, I may be wrong about several things. But, since no one else answered yet, I guess it's better than nothing. \n\n1 - Oftentimes, the same thing can be studied from different perspectives. \n\nFor example, if I wanted to study how price influences purchase decisions, I might consider very different fields, like Economy, Marketing, Psychology, and Statistics. All of them can deal with this topic, but with a different approach. A PhD in psychology might focus on aspects like emotion and personality, while a PhD in economy might focus on the mathematical analysis of utility functions. \n\nSo, she may have trouble finding the right PhD, the right field of study. One way to deal with that is to read many papers about her research interests, and find the papers that look like something she would like to do. And then see who are the authors of those papers. Are the authors PhDs in physical therapy, like the example you mentioned? Or are they from another field? Where do they work? \n\n2 - Both the subject and the institution count. \n\nIf the institution does research the subject, but that research is just crap, it's not good. \n\nIf the institution does quality research, but not about the subject of interest, it's not good. \n\nRank and reputation can be dangerous guidelines. For example, you can have a university that is ranked very high and have a very good reputation, but that's for bachelors and masters, not PhDs. \n\nQuality still matters, it's just not so closely related with the usual perceptions about the quality of institutions (since those perceptions are not developed based on PhDs). \n\n3 - There is no simple answer about funding. \n\nEach PhD student can give you a different answer about how funding works for them. For some people, obtaining funding is not a concern and it is virtually automatic if you get accepted by the university. For other people, it's a huge challenge and a nightmare year after year. With a lot of variations between those extreme situations. \n\n4 - From what I hear in my field, usually both US and UK programs start their PhDs in Fall (so, around September as you mentioned).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kslo1w/advice_on_studying_for_a_phd_as_a_foreign_student/gii40vg/"}, "1091": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "blabbermeister", "Date": 1610076361, "Score": 3, "Body": "Or fear of going out in the world.

When I was on my co-op I asked many people that got a graduate level degrees while working or after they took a break and worked for a while and they all told me they regretted it.\n\nIf they had gotten their degree while working, it was really difficult to juggle it all and they didn't have a social life essentially the whole time they were getting their degree. It also took a really long time. I have a friend that is getting an MS while working and he's taking about a course a semester.. It's going to be at LEAST 3 years before he graduates and sees the pay bump for that.\n\nOn the other side of things, if you are really into your possible PhD work then you could quit work and be a full time student. I also asked my colleagues about this too. Most of them that actually did that said it was really hard to leave having money to being a poor student again and being occupied with studies all the time.\n\nIn both situations you have to pause your life somewhat. If you want to have kids or save up for a house, it will be delayed because of the money spent on school and the time it will take to complete it. In addition, and in my eyes, one of the more important aspects, is you will be missing out on additional income that you could earn if you came out of the gate having fully completed your graduate degree. After you have a graduate degree not only do you get a higher salary, but raises are typically better than someone with only a bachelors degree. If you do the calculation over time, it ends up being a good amount of loss because the income and raises compound.\n\nIn the end I found it was much better to go straight into graduate school after my undergraduate. I was already on the \"school grind\" from my bachelors degree. And over time, you make more money when you enter your career. I also had connections from my undergraduate to professors that had research that I knew I enjoyed. Anyway, that's what my thought process was when making that decision.\n\nAs far as how I'm doing, I'm great. I love the research I'm doing. The only downside is that the pay isn't much at all. It's enough to be able to live and enjoy some things. But the hard part is watching my friends who have full time jobs buy and do fun things with their money. What gets me through this is knowing it'll be very worth it in the end.\n\nEdit: the salary and pay information may be different depending on what you go in to.

After taking time off of writing for the holidays, I've had a hard time getting back into the swing of things. This week was even more distracting and sad because of the US Capitol riots. I struggle with managing ADHD, depression and anxiety. \n\nWhat has helped me:\n1. Having a routine, including self-care things before and after working. \n\n2. Breaking down the goal of \"finishing my dissertation\" into daily S.M.A.R.T. goals using a Gantt chart. Sometimes these goals are super simple - 'start working at 1pm by opening the document'\n\n3. Having an accountability partner who has access to my Gantt chart (on Google docs since I need to adjust it frequently). For me, this person is my mom - she's nonjudgmental, will follow up about things I've said, and listens when I need to vent about feeling anxious, upset, etc. She just retired from a C level position so this is also giving her a management type of project and pandering to her motherly desires of helping her child haha. \n\n4. Reframing my self-critical thoughts into \"what is this telling me?\" For example, today I took several naps and felt sad and ashamed that I wasn't as productive as I had planned. I changed my thoughts from \"I'm lazy; I'm dumb; I'm never going to graduate\" to \"ok, what am I feeling in my body? What is triggering this sadness? \"What does my body need?\" Turns out I'm missing my family and didn't drink enough water or eat enough. That helped.

I regularly exercise, meditate, eat well, fairly good sleep schedule, etc... these don't necessarily improve my motivation to finish, but they certainly don't make things worse and I can tell the difference when I let 2 or more of them slip.\n\nFocusing on my future doesn't help because it's so abstract and thinking about job hunting makes me more anxious. Although quitting is extremely tempting, I know I'd regret it in the long term and that makes me keep putting on foot in front of the other on this mental death march-this may or may not be the case for you. Really search yourself and if you feel like quitting is the right option, do it. You are ultimately the one who will have to live with the decision and it may be the right thing to do for your mental health. You might also want to see if there are alternatives (ie., changing your PhD into another Masters?). Yes you're almost finished, but to be honest the last part is the hardest (I loved the classes, running trials, etc...writing &amp; defending? not so much). Only you can decided what's best for you. \n\nHere's what's (currently) working for me:\n\n1. **Eliminate distractions**. Obvious one-I have StayFocused timer that blocks fun websites on my browser, I turn off my phone, shut the door, put headphones on, etc... so that there is nothing else but my work.\n2. **Motivation does not proceed action, action generates motivation**. Just set a timer for 15 mins &amp; do SOMETHING. Are you somewhat focused when the timer dings? Set it again. If not, try another task or move the same task to another location (hard with lockdown, but even moving from room to room in your home can help).\n3. **Match your work with your mind**. There's always SOMETHING that needs to be done. When I'm feeling super meh, I can still find references, build tables, organize papers to be read, do any basic admin, etc... These are not high energy tasks, more busy work, but they get me moving. Usually after 1-2 h I actually start reading/writing and get into deep work. If not, I continue on and at least I've accomplished something at the end of the day. \n4. **Do something everyday**. I know a lot of people say to take the weekends off, but I prefer to do at least something daily. Make an outline, print (maybe even read) a paper, edit the previous writing. Even if it's just 10 mins of scanning over what I wrote and make some notes. The longer I take time off the harder it feels to restart, like the resistance/anxiety/general malaise builds back up and ugh-it's Monday and I feel overwhelmed. However if you feel you benefit from full breaks, then keep on keeping on.\n5. **Monitor your progress &amp; make it a game**. There are plenty of apps that make games from habits, so not hard to fit in. My game is I mark every 30 min block of work I do and then try to meet or beat the previous day's score (with Sat &amp; Sun being the exception-I normally only do 30min-1hr). I prefer to measure time v/s output because output can be difficult to quantify (300 precise words &gt; 10 pages of babble). \n\nThat's pretty much it. Set those steps up into a routine (ie. I will start work at 8:00am and do SOMETHING for at least an hour) and just keep rolling. I have general deadlines in my head, but initially just get started. Once you get moving on a basic task and your mind is starting to focus, you can switch over to more important/time sensitive tasks. The first step is the most important, just start moving. Motion &gt; Emotion. \n\nHope this helps!\n\n**TL;DR**: PhD's are mentally draining. Start with the easiest task, see if you can build some mental momentum-if yes, great; if no, you did something.

It's very odd - by this point I have been writing and speaking in academic English for over a decade, and every time someone knows my background (Latino), they start to get 'confused' by everything I say. I have never read a journal article in my field that has the level of clarity and eloquence that keeps getting demanded from me and my immigrant peers.\n\nI don't think it's malice or ignorance. I've always thought of it as a blind spot that gets very harsh at top tier unis. I rationalise it as an interpretive problem of the academic community that *can* be fixed - as opposed to some redemptive qualities of my particular ethnicity - only because I think identity politics are not very instructive or useful (that's just me).\n\nThe frustration we share, I think, is captured by some of the work on 'epistemic injustice'.

I was (and remain) spiteful to the blind gate-keeping that discriminates against non White, English-speaking junior scholars. Crucially, my advisors were *phenomenal,* and were the only reason I could move beyond spite to put this while frustration to use.\n\nSorry if this was long or sounded patronising. Your post struck a familiar note and I wanted to connect and at tell you that I truly believe that the experience you have lived through - having to do the extra work to have your contribution noted - will shine through in all your future work in cool ways because you will have a distinct voice that dominantly-situated people will never have.

The situation itself is is quite complicated and I would definitely recommend to talk with your supervisor or someone who manages the PhD program at your institute. I am a very recent astro phd graduate from the NL, so I am a bit familiar with the rules. It is quite difficult to extend your PhD program with full salary because the grant will expire and due to Dutch labor laws. These laws prohibit companies (including universities) to keep extending someones job with short term contracts (e.g. 1 or 2 years). The 4th contract should be an indefinite contract if I remember correctly. And this is something the university can not offer to a PhD candidate. I know the government wanted to change the number of contracts and their duration in 2018, but I don't know the current rules.\n\nYou can get an extension for a couple months depending on the financial situation of your institute. I had one for 2 months at 70% FTE. If your contract is not extended you can use unemployment benefits which will cover your salary for 70 percent. This gets you by for a couple months to a year. During this time you can work on your thesis. I know some people who have done this. But to keep the benefits you will have to prove that you are applying for jobs and trying to go back into society. I am not sure how this works with your visa status. After this the only option left is to work part-time / evenings on your thesis. I have heard that this happens often in the humanities department.\n\nI would definitely recommend to keep working until you have switched your visa. Then you at least know that you can stay without needing a contract. Most astronomy graduates in NL switch to data science. I know that there are many data science traineeships both in the private sector and in the government. These will train you for a couple months and then you get deployed at a company / institute for training, while getting paid a pretty nice salary.

OP is very much lia\n\nI am not sure that is true. I did a PhD in NL and I had a 1+3 contract like everyone else in my department. So it will depend on the universities policy and the persons situation. And I understand that an extension can be given on medical grounds, ethically I think it should be required to give the extension. However, grants are finite and at a certain point there is nothing left. I think this is the reason why universities are not required to extend the contracts due to sickness. This is an article that discusses several optional CAO (collective labor agreement) clauses [https://hetpnn.nl/en/2020/10/22/persbericht-optionele-cao-bepalingen-voor-promovendi-vaak-niet-in-de-praktijk-gebracht/](https://hetpnn.nl/en/2020/10/22/persbericht-optionele-cao-bepalingen-voor-promovendi-vaak-niet-in-de-praktijk-gebracht/) . One of them is that universities *may* extend a PhD due to sickness but are not required to. This will depend completely on the financial state of the department. So while you should always pursue an extension, there is a chance it will not be granted. The research from PNN ([https://hetpnn.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PNN-PhD-survey-report-Collective-Labor-Agreement.pdf](https://hetpnn.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PNN-PhD-survey-report-Collective-Labor-Agreement.pdf)) shows that from the people that asked for an extension, about 2/3 got an extension for the duration of their sickness.\n\nSo the best person to discuss this with will be your supervisor, phd program head or department head, because they will need to start the process of getting an extension and they have to find additional funding.  \n\n\nedit: edited a couple typo's", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kuj07a/advice_on_dealing_with_a_probable_phd_failure_nl/gityl9x/"}, "1410": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "burnout_phd", "Date": 1610335572, "Score": 1, "Body": "Hey unlike your \"observation\" it is quite common to grant people extension based on valid medical situations for phds.

That sounds really uncomfortable, and I can understand how it would be difficult to hear and affect your confidence moving forward. I just wanted to comment to say... maybe it's not as bad as you think?\n\nIf you are pursuing a PhD, you can expect to have your work criticized in writing, and in public. That is sort of the whole deal when doing science. Were they workshopping areas of weakness in the study? They may have been trying to point them out in order to address them in some way, either in a limitations section of a draft or just generally with you so that you are aware (obviously in a different conversation with you). Are you not having conversations with others, such as the advisor and postdocs,  about the weakness of your approach? Or, areas where you feel things are not going well? If this is the first time you are hearing that sort of conversation, perhaps it could seem serious? But, even the \"best\" science can be criticized, rightly, for different assumptions and methodological choices. I think the work I do is quite rigorous, but if someone asks me to point out 10 ways it is wrong, I could do so. Same with all of my friends and the studies they work on - if they are thoughtful and honest. There are some scientists who feel they are gods among mere mortals and project that attitude. But, it is a projection.\n\nObviously having coworkers talk about you behind your back is hurtful. But is there a chance it could be reframed as the team trying to come up with ways to help you address those weaknesses? Would they have been discussing these things in order to help you improve your work? If the postdocs are friendly to you and you consider them your friends, I would try and trust that although they were discussing your work critically, that doesn't mean they dislike you or don't think you can succeed.\n\nIf the conversation was about the research, I would brush it off. If the conversation was about your work ethic, performance in classes, or something personal to you, then I do think it would be worth having a conversation about. But, the power structures in academia are really fucked (at least in the US) so it does not always benefit students to go up against their advisors. I would start by asking the postdocs something like: \"I heard your meeting with my advisor prior to when I got the call and was wondering if you would share with me things you think I could improve.\" If they say you're doing well, but the study has weaknesses and then list those, I would stop worrying.

I read that you finished 1 paper, which means you will need to finish at least 2 more. Doing this is in your evenings and weekends is possible. However, you should think about the impact this will have on your life and also your happiness. This will mean that for a long time (several years) you will always feel the pressure and stress to work on your thesis in your personal time. So if you get off work it will be difficult to relax and spend your time with your spouse because that thesis is always looming. If there are life changing events (buying a house, moving somewhere else, children, etc...) these will push the thesis further away. And, it is difficult to stay ahead of the developments in the field if you are not always connected to the research (meetings, colloquia). This will have an impact on your research. I am not trying to say that you should quit trying to get your thesis, but these are things to consider in case you want to do it in your spare time.\n\nIf you want to quit your program that is okay too. It is your life. You should do what makes you happy. It is not a personal failure if you decide this PhD is not for me. You have already shown that you can do research, you published! You had a lot of excruciating circumstances, and sometimes things do not work out even though you want it really bad. For example, people that are trying to become prof. soccer players but can not go prof. because they have been in seriously injured in a car accident. This may be a bit of an extreme example, but life happens.\n\nFor the career counseling I was not thinking about your own department. Usually there is a separate career counseling part of the university. If this is the case you could go. People will not know you or your background. While universities look like a single large institute, many departments talk very little with each other. Especially the research vs student business units. They will not know you.\n\nIn the end at least you should take a stance for your happiness, it is not guaranteed that other people will. So you should allow yourself to make the choices that make you happy. And many times the people that love you want to support the choices that make you happy, even if that means changing directions.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kuj07a/advice_on_dealing_with_a_probable_phd_failure_nl/giwhm8w/"}, "1475": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "DeepSeaDarkness", "Date": 1610385306, "Score": 11, "Body": "Pick the supervisor, not the PhD/salary/country", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kv6y64/choosing_a_phd/giwicy6/"}, "1476": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ScruffiestDog", "Date": 1610385348, "Score": 5, "Body": "To me, Option 2 looks more appealing due to the research.

When I was applying to grad school 7 years ago, I was so frustrated too. \n\nHere are some tips:\n\n1) you are probably not the only person writing to them asking about a possible position. Make sure to stand out. Succinct emails that could impress the professor(s) and also stroke their ego a little are the best. They will yield response more frequently. However, those responses can be positive or negative. \n\n2) if you are genuinely interested in their work, what specific question(s) could you ask about any specific recent publication? Put yourself in the  position of a current lab member and ask those questions. That will help. Sometimes suggesting future directions as a question will help as their lab might currently be doing the same. I know that this is too much to ask for someone seeking admission. But, if the competition is fierce, you need to put in more work. Right? \n\n3) it is not just about how bad you want to be in that lab, it is also about how fitting you will be. Check point 2. Also check to see their current lab structure if possible. Everybody has preferences or biases whether that is politically correct or not. If a lab only favours a certain identity, you should beware of it. \n\nFinally, even before asking professors for a position, asking their students about the lab and the professor is important IMO. \n\nLab environment is probably the most important aspect of getting your PhD.\n\nAll the very best!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kv1h3e/cant_get_in_touch_with_professors/giyty7j/"}, "1534": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "FPchick", "Date": 1610427439, "Score": 1, "Body": "But Zotero is not compatible with iPhone right?I downloaded Mendeley on iPhone and like the features but it was hard to toggle.

Then we would meet and discuss our thoughts, and my advisor would clearly put everything into his own words when he submitted the final review. We would get feedback on our thinking and be shown where our argument was strong or weak. Overall, the practice probably helped him a little via delegation and brainstorming. But he made sure we were benefited through the training he provided and how he structured it all. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement; but I strongly feel that we, the students, came out on top.

It does not sound like your advisor is giving you any feedback or context whatsoever. Also, reviewing a paper a month sounds a bit frequent to me--is he offloading all of his reviews onto you?

If you can't answer either of those questions, then it is my opinion that your advisor is doing not just a lazy but also a shameful job.\n\nAnd that's just the reviews! You also hinted at your negative experience publishing your own work with this guy. Sounds like a pattern to me. So my next questions would be: 1) Is he tenured? 2) How far along in his career is he? 3) Is it just you, or are there others in his research group--and if so, what is their experience? Anyway, if you are not his first or only student, you can look up his papers that were published with prior students as first-authors.

I have no insight into the education hierarchy and processes in India. My suggestion would have been similar to the above.  The alternative is that you self seek funding either from companies or agencies who would be viable stakeholders in your project, or from awarding bodies that exist to provide finances to students. For example, in Scotland we have a Carnegie grant for postgraduate students. You send in your proposal and if you are successful you recieve a stipend and all tuition paid. \n\nThis is a far more difficult route, particularly if you have to go down the route of private funding (e.g., companies that may benefit from your research). I would also advise that if you do go down this route that you think carefully about the balance between the funding you would recieve and any obligations, or ethical and moral issues; companies often wont want research published if it reflects negatively :) [thats without publication bias]. \n\nIf you go down the route of sourcing your own funding (rather than applying for PhD programmes that are already seeking candidates) then you should ideally have a mentor in mind who can help you craft a strong application and help you when it comes to gatekeeping, ethics and grant writing processes. This is also a challenge, as without an existing relationship, most professors or mentors wont want to spend lots of time on project and student that might lead to nowhere (they are busy folks). \n\nWith that said, you can either apply for existing PhD roles which already come with some financial elements embedded, or you can choose the alternative routes of either self funding through work or through sourcing external and potentially private meands of funding. \n\nHope that helps!

If you do your PhD fulltime, you normally get a 4-year contract, during which you are paid a normal salary (2395 euros per month before taxes in the first year, 3061 in the last), and you get normal (and good!) employment conditions. The only PhDs who are not employed by the university are those who pay for it themselves, possibly through funding from a company. PhD positions are generally advertised as vacancies, you can look for what is currently advertised here:  [https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/) .  If you don't currently see any vacancies that fit, you can at least use the vacancies to get an idea of what they generally ask of PhD candidates.  \n\n\nSo if you don't currently see a vacancy that fits your interest, if I were you I would look into the different research group and staff members that work on topics that you find interesting. If you have ideas about what you would like to work on: that's great of course! You can just send an email to a staff member to explain your interest and background, to ask if they have any positions coming up. Very often they know if there will be any positions in the near future, sometimes they might still be waiting for funding, but it is always good if they know you and know that you are motivated. You could even try to ask for a short meeting to just share research ideas, some might be open for that (although it depends on the person of course).

I was able to complete a benchmark manuscript, pass comprehensive exams, and get 5 publications out. I had great momentum and strong support from my advisor and committee. Once COVID struck, that all changed. I am now in year 5 with a questionable year 6 graduation, according to my committee. \n\nMy dissertation proposal was to be submitted to my committee no later than September 1, but it was delayed for several reasons. First, I use sensitive data that can only be analyzed on campus due to disclosure risks. This is a hurdle for obvious reasons. My advisor suggested I continue writing and use public access data as a substitute but, in the same breath, wanted descriptive statistics on my sample. I can\u2019t really do that without my data. So, bump two months while they figured out how we can safely conduct research. I sent a copy of the proposal in early October to my advisor only to be told my format was entirely wrong. Excellent news to hear, you know? It should probably be mentioned that the several times I asked for general guidance I was told to approach it like three manuscripts with a general introduction. Turns out he didn\u2019t care for that but gave me excellent feedback and advice on how to change it. It took about two months to reorganize, edit, and generate descriptive analyses for my committee. He received the draft on December 3. Understandably, comments took a while with finals and then holiday. I meet with him this week to talk through my proposal with the hopes of sending it to my committee by March for a defense in April. I\u2019m not upset with my advisor, to be clear.

I experimented with many productivity methods, and this is what ultimately worked well for me:\n\n1. **Social accountability -** I joined a dissertation writing boot camp and also organized a writing group with some of my colleagues in my research group. These took place over Zoom (video conference platform). We would start the session by sharing our goals for the day, work quietly in virtual company/accountability for 1-3 hours, and then conclude by sharing how it went and our plans for next steps. In the group with my colleagues, we also shared samples of writing and gave each other feedback every week. These writing groups were immensely helpful for me, both from an accountability and emotional support standpoint! Does your university have a writing center you can access? Or do you have colleagues in your group or department who you can write with?\n2. **Setting goals (but being flexible) -** I've always been a compulsive planner, and it helped me a lot to break out my dissertation into a list of large goals, then break those into smaller goals, then assign those goals by week on a monthly timeline. On a daily basis, I set [SMARTER](https://www.wanderlustworker.com/setting-s-m-a-r-t-e-r-goals-7-steps-to-achieving-any-goal/) goals (wrote out by hand) and found that it helped a lot to make sure I had actionable, concrete things to do each day. One of my major problems is that sometimes I wouldn't meet my goals and feel demoralized from that, so also be sure to frame these goals with self-compassion and flexibility if one day is not as good as the others!\n3. **Healthy work environment -** I got a standing desk and monitor! This doesn't work for everyone, but it made a big difference for me not to be sitting or craning over my laptop. Experiment with different ways to make your work environment conducive to productivity and good health. In line with that, I took walks every morning, at lunch, and any time I felt a slump - it really helped a lot to physically move and be outside.\n4. **Self-compassion -** Recognize that these are incredibly difficult circumstances to be doing the already onerous task of writing a thesis, and be kind to yourself. Some days will be more difficult than others, and that's ok. Be flexible with your goals and celebrate any bit of progress/accomplishments you make to keep yourself going!\n\nOn another note, do you have a thesis committee? I've found that one of the best ways to make progress in writing is to have it iterated with feedback.

I am an MA student of American and German Philosophy and Literature, I am not sure what your field is, could you tell us? \n\nI would recommend a book (2 actually) *Teaching Today* and *Evidence Based Teaching* both by [Geoff Petty](http://geoffpetty.com), to you but also almost everyone. These are not only suited for elementary and secondary education, but are extremely useful guides on basics of teaching for colleges all the way to daily work life.\n\nNow, to your argument. In my view, the \"psychological warfare/brutality/assault\" is not the fact that Mr./Ms. Hitmage failed in one or some aspects. The pathological behaviour here is to divulge the private information of someone's progress on the thesis:\n\n&gt;\"It wasn\u2019t, of course. I got the delight to hear him and the post docs I work with (and considered friends) trashing my work, my approach, basically anything my mind had ever feared they were saying was being spoken out loud.\" [...] \n\n&gt;\"I logged out and took a few moments to breathe, but every time I signed back in they were still talking about me.\".\n\nThey had no business talking about him. I mentioned I am in Literature, therefore, I do not know whether the reason his supervisor was divulging his/her private information to other people was strong enough to do so, but judging from what I have come across so far, it is entirely unacceptable and pathological for a supervisor to hold casual chats with other people about your progress. This is also what GDPR attempts to combat directly in European Union. Europeans like to complain about it, but it is actually to protect their data and make conduct like OPs case illegal (Consult the law here though, I might be wrong).\n\nDivulging private details of someone's progress is unnecessary, it is a waste of energy, time,  and it is demeaning to a student that failed. A contractor like that (now the supervisor doing *his* job) would be urinating all over the counter, breaking the windows and throwing the plates out of the cupboard, along with doing the job. \n\nI am sorry for the lecture, but I wanted to be thorough and nuanced in what I meant, when I stood up for Mr./Ms. Hitmage. I will add one more quote from Nietzsche (**the quote** that motivated me to write a thesis on him)\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) 47-48: \n&gt;\u201cand that cruelty declines drastically in comparison to the older, stronger, more devout age. But this praise I cannot endorse any more than the reproaches: I concede only that cruelty now refines itself and that its older forms henceforth offend taste; but wounding and torturing with word and eye reaches its highest cultivation in times of corruption\u2014it is now alone that malice and the delight in malice are born. People who live in an age of corruption are witty and slanderous; they know that there are other kinds of murder than by dagger or assault; they also know that whatever is well said is believed.\u201d", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kuk0km/i_had_my_worst_fear_confirmed/gj48bdb/"}, "1813": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Asthasharma22", "Date": 1610554197, "Score": 7, "Body": "\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kwdgai/ah_well_i_guess_ill_have_to_take_a_break_it_would/gj4h8es/"}, "1814": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "charina12", "Date": 1610555030, "Score": 28, "Body": "Is he your advisor or just a committee member?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kwdgai/ah_well_i_guess_ill_have_to_take_a_break_it_would/gj4j1hh/"}, "1815": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "heidzelaine", "Date": 1610555805, "Score": 9, "Body": "Awww.

While this company is a non-profit research institute that has many ties to universities (e.g. my promotor works part time as a professor, part time at this company), I know that it also happens in other companies in The Netherlands.\n\nI would say a few things are important here:\n\n1. Has anyone else done this before within your company? If the company has experience with things like these they will probably already have ideas or rules about things like IP, supervision, time you can spend on your PhD, etc.\n\n2. Does the company have any ties to universities already in place (or connections from the past)? If that's the case, it will be easier for you to find a supervisor etc in those specific universities.\n\n3. The amount of years it will take you to finish the PhD is usually more flexible in a construction like that, but you need to make sure that there will be enough work in a reasonable amount of time that you can be 'first author' of and make part of your thesis.

People on RA tend to be more productive in research but that\u2019s not always true. \n\nYou should be careful when picking a school in the US though, because some schools and programs will make you sign a contract with a \u201cno-work\u201d clause. Basically if you get another job you lose your assistantship regardless of if it\u2019s RA or TA. \n\nIn STEM, depending on the focus, stipends usually range from $15K to $30K per year. If you\u2019re on RA you can sometimes negotiate a higher stipend but you have to go through your advisor for this and sometimes programs don\u2019t allow it. Some schools also have fees that you\u2019re required to pay, so make sure your stipend can cover these or the program permits you to get another job to pay them if your stipend is too low. In the US student loans are also pretty easy to obtain for grad school but obviously not ideal. \n\nThis turned into a monster comment, sorry, but I hope it helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/kx1l9r/living_with_phd_stipendfunding/gj80mot/"}, "1947": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1610628445, "Score": 1, "Body": "I have not taken a proper course on differential equations yet and I got a C in thermodynamics.

My experiments got shut down in March 2020 because of the pandemic. So March and April I focused on what I was planning to do to design my experiments slightly better for when they could restart. In May the decision was made that there would be no more experiments in my project so I started writing my thesis in May. At this point, I only had the literature review down. My PI told me my experiments were not enough data for my PhD so I did some extra work on a different and new project to make it up. My final deadline for thesis submission is end of February 2021.

It's really helped me having video calls every day with a fellow PhD where we write in 50 minute blocks. Also having a basic to do list of everything that needs doing in small chunks.

The good news is that you are surrounded by people in your department who know PhD chemists/physicists/engineers/etc who have gotten jobs. Surely, someone in your department (or some of the folks in other STEM departments that you or some of your colleagues may know) knows someone who has gone into consulting or whatever field you are interested in. If you really ask around, you\u2019ll probably find that someone at your university knows someone out there who has the kind of experience you are looking for... and if you are polite and ask nicely, you can probably get an introduction to this person and informational interview with them where they can tell you about their job and give you valuable feedback or point you in the way of opportunities.\n\nI found that the key was talking to alums, recruiters, professors in my department... anyone who possibly knew anyone. I shamelessly (but politely/respectful of folks\u2019 time) followed up with total strangers who handed out their business cards for informational interviews and stepped way outside of my comfort zone. And you know what? People were usually willing to schedule a 20-minute call with me to help look over my resume, point out things that I should highlight in interviews, and generally offer feedback. Sometimes, they\u2019ll (unknown to you) even put in a good word for you or get you in contact with someone else who may be willing to help. I\u2019ll stress here that I didn\u2019t have a ton of papers or awards or things that would make me stand out as a traditionally strong candidate in academia. However, the people I talked to helped me realize that I had other experience that the companies I was applying to were looking for, and as a result, I was better able to market myself as a job candidate.\n\nMy chem department hosted a number of companies doing recruiting trips (including at least one consulting firm if I\u2019m remembering correctly). I had the most success through these department-specific sessions and eventually got my industry job through there. Does your department have these or is there some sort of career fair or career services office at your university with resources geared toward PhDs? I realize these days that things might be cancelled or virtual due to COVID restrictions.\n\nFinally, even if you aren\u2019t sure you\u2019d be qualified to work at the companies that may be doing recruiting at your university or that the job is a full fit to your interests, APPLY ANYWAY! At worst, you get extra experience getting your application materials together. You might even be able to ask the recruiter for feedback if you get an initial interview and are later turned down. I turned in my resume to the recruiter coming from my current company on a whim and didn\u2019t think that I was at all qualified or interested. I not only got an initial interview a few hours later, but it became clear during that interview that the job was a great fit.

And for them, they tough it out, it works for them, and they have no regrets.

For me it's presenting. Sure now it's on webinars etc but I signed up to as many conferences  and stuff as I could and I loved it. Hated my work. Hated the lack of progression but loved the science communication. Even if I had quit my PhD, I'd have gained that, at least.\n-Honestly, consider quitting. Is this right for you? Is this worth how it's making you feel. Or will quitting make you feel even worse?\n-If you want to stick with it, make a plan of action. Sure, your supervisor is way hands off. Bring up you university code if practice. What is the viva assessing? Work backwards and jot down what you need to do to pass the viva. Break it all down into bite size chunks and reward yourself with whatever works for you when you achieve them.\n\nIn the meantime I would say, do some things that may you feel like you.

I have no group where I could go and discuss my work, I give no presentation about my work because I have no group and other people discuss their work weekly by giving presentations in the meetings. He asked me to be part of their meeting but no one there understands my work and I do not understand their work much. It is like every week I go and seat there for 2 hours! I'm on my own but I do not feel discouraged, although time to time I do feel but I keep pushing myself. I focus on small small daily progress, some days there is no progress at all. Some days I don't feel like working then I just read books and watch something inspiring or funny which makes me feel fine and then I get back and small progress and this way keep going. That's how most PhD students do. There is nothing wrong with you, it is how this field is. There are some people who finish quickly in 3-4 years but keep in mind that everyone's journey is different. Some people get easy topic, some get hard. I'm developing something new in my work so it is not easy but challenging, while a friend of mine got a topic where he has to conduct three similar experiments and do the data analysis so he is confident that he will finish in 3.5 years. You need to understand one thing, that PhD is the only time when you get total freedom to do what you want to do and it's a learning part of life, so focus on learning and stop comparing yourself with others. See how far you have come in the 3.5 years in terms of knowledge and learning etc, rather than looking at the number of publications. I do not believe in looking at others. Grass looks greener on the other side. I confronted my supervisor and told him clearly that my work is different and it is wrong that he keeps showing me other people's progress. He admitted his mistake and since then stop doing so. You must learn to find what works for you and compare yourself with 'yourself' only, then you will feel proud of yourself as I'm sure you are everyday better than yesterday's 'you'.

This is yet another pseudo-academic institute that shells out free market economic briefs to any high donor who wants to influence US policy. It\u2019s the kind of think tank that will shield themselves from any scrutiny by branding themselves as the objective economist - that is, at least until it\u2019s time to deny climate change, at which point they\u2019re happy to assume scientific authority. They consult for some of the most disappointing politicians today, include Diane Feinstein and Rand Paul.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that WaMo cites a blog post rather than a journal. This way, Richard Vedder can get away with spouting \u201ceconomics speak\u201d without getting called for not actually doing any economic analysis. At best, he hints at market failures that can be described as a societal welfare loss in the education market or productivity loss (i.e. why can\u2019t our young just join the workforce instead of being economically productive?). But, again, he hasn\u2019t done any kind of analysis we should expect from an economist. Of course we don\u2019t actually want economists to weigh in on the non-tangible/quantifiable perks of education, but the analysis is unacceptable by any social science standard, economics or otherwise.\n\nWaMo slips up a few times too. If we are meant to humor Vedder as a serious economist, then one should acknowledge that economics doesn\u2019t usually aim model the intangible (like \u201ccivic engagement\u201d). But even WaMo understands that there are serious flaws with Vedder\u2019s lack of mention of any confounding variables that one won\u2019t find in BLS statistics.\n\nTo anybody who feels insecure (or even feels the impulse to internalize Vedder\u2019s message here) - take the following message instead: if you\u2019re underemployed or never use your degree, at least you can say that you don\u2019t make a living by pretending to use your degree.

The drawback of iPad Air is that it doesn't have a 120Hz display(if you don't know what it is, it just shows more frames per second to make everything look smoother). If you plan to use your iPad only for note taking and nothing more intense, this should be fine.\n\n2.iPad Pro: This is slightly more expensive but comes with a 120Hz which is a real beaut. Every single animation like even scrolling will look buttery smooth. If you plan to use your iPad for more than just notes, get this if you have the money. You won't regret it.\n\nFor me, I have a third option, which is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ and I don't think you need to consider this given you already own apple devices. For a tablet, the display is more important as it is what you look at all the time. If you able to try these devices out beforehand, check it once and get the one which you like the most.\n\nAll these are more than good enough for note taking, annotating papers ans regular academic stuff other than coding.

For that, it might require some talking to colleagues or people (usually grad students, cause they tend to be honest) at prospective universities what their thoughts are on particular potential advisors. Usually this would be done as part of the interview process, but I see no reason why an email wouldn't also work. In fact, you might get a more honest answer that way.

Accountants, delivery people, janitors, all help maintain a society. \n\nOn the opposite end, there are roles that help advance the society; those who create new things, helping that in 10 years, the society will build on what these have done. For example, a music composer creates new content (a regular musician in the other hand plays that content, not necessarily creating new things). A writer creates new stories from new ideas.

Everybody has a different \"lesson\" from this.\n\nMy PhD mentorship was phenomenal, both by my advisor and my committee who I easily call friends and colleagues years later.

And most importantly, I learned how to implement creativity into the science part, which I think is sorely lacking nowadays.\n\nMy postdoc was a very different experience.  It was a \"successful\" institute based on funding, but to do so was to be cutthroat and to flout one's work despite it's lack of interest or applicability.\n\nI asked the question whether or not my ideal could succeed, and what would need to happen in order to do just that.  Implemented an idea once I had the ingredients and the parties to help.  Ended up getting a lot of interest from several different departments and institutes.  It was new in every sense of the word.\n\nAnd my department eventually punished me for it.  Was reprimanded because I was \"acting like a PI\" (departmental politics aren't fun when the higher ups simply don't like you without just cause).  At the same time, that work and the friends I made before and after provided for several new job opportunities that wouldn't have been made available if I hadn't pursued it.\n\nSo I got my answer.  Yes, you can do new and novel work that is relevant and successful, with the right planning, communication, and a healthy dose of luck.  The success itself is not tied to academia; in fact, I would argue that academia is a terrible determinant for new ideas.

Unless people ask, like you're doing. I enjoy my PhD much more than I enjoyed my undergrad, even though my undergrad was a pretty good experience too.

Take the surveys that Nature publishes every year, e.g. the [2019 version](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7): Most PhDs work 50+ hours a week, and roughly 30% are being treated for some kind of psychological condition.

The numbers are more or less extreme depending on the location and field, but it's safe to say that &lt;5 % of people starting a PhD end up in a tenured faculty position (see pre-pandemic [US numbers](http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2017/12/20/know-the-odds/), [UK numbers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06873-5)). It can still be enjoyable along the way (and usually is at least some of the time), but \"I want to become a professor\" is not terribly realistic, statistically speaking. \n\nHowever, it's not all that grim: Having a PhD leads to above-average chances of finding a satisfying job, no matter where you end up. Per this (pre-pandemic) survey in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07111-8), the people that stayed in academia have the lowest of the PhD-holding bunch, and still are above average compared to the general population. \n\nHope that helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/l1qygw/does_anybody_ever_enjoyed_doing_their_phd/gk1n6rm/"}, "2992": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "cousincarne", "Date": 1611220917, "Score": 1, "Body": "Same her, 4 years, no article, prof has no clue, others have progress, I have to justify reading a book.

If anything, I asked my dad who had owned a business at one point (non-science at all) for pointers, which ended up being invaluable.  I would discuss each step before and after with my PI, but it was uncharted waters for him also, and because it was successful there was no reason to say no.\n\n&gt;I think thats what I've been hoping for in trying to develop lifelong friends and colleagues who share similar ideals along the way, but that has not happened yet. \n\nOne of the harsh life lessons I learned was that people you interact with need to be figured out quickly and can be put into categories.  To put it bluntly, some initiate the ideas, some build upon the ideas (self-motivated and inquisitive), some simply just want to get a paycheck and put the least work into anything but all the accolades, and some are complete leeches.  \n\nIt took time to figure people out and develop those friendships.

There's the system more common in the US where you start a PhD, but the first two years or so are going to be spent very similar to this and then you need to take qualifying exams.

The other system is more common basically everywhere else where you get a separate masters first (so more similar to what you've already done) and then go find a PhD. \n\nYou're not going to be able to skip taking masters level work. If you can't handle basic coursework, a PhD is not a skip. It's just something you do after a Masters.\n\n&gt; Where's the learning?\n\nI think this is a major misconception with PhDs. I certainly had it before I started. A PhD is nothing like a masters/bachelor. It's more like a job as a researcher. That's a better way to think about it. You're a researcher who's mainly doing the job for your own benefit in order to gain a degree.\n\n&gt; A PhD will help me to get into academia.\n\nThere are PhDs that are more geared toward teaching. I'm doing my PhD in the Netherlands and I'm doing a \"Teaching PhD\", so my PhD, in theory, takes 2 years longer than the standard 4 years, and I spend about 40% of my time teaching instead of research. I teach a lot more than many of my non Teaching-PhD peers. I know a lot of PhDs end up being TAs, either for extra money or as a part of their work.\n\nYou can find programs that have a bigger teaching component if your goal is to end up teaching CS. Will this help break into academia? Probably not. Would you enjoy the PhD more? Yes. Teaching is one of the things I enjoy the most about my PhD.\n\n&gt; Why have had you felt the need to do a PhD?\n\nMy family always tried to steer me in this direction, and I always said \"I'll only do a PhD if I'm being paid to do it\". Well, I got an offer from a Dutch university to come do a PhD, and it's paid. Between the coronavirus making everyone's employment super unstable and a job offer to get another degree and get paid to do it, it was a no-brainer to take the offer. \n\nBut if you asked me a year ago where I thought I would be today, I'd have answered that I'd be working as a programmer. I honestly did not see myself doing a PhD. But I applied on a whim (it was free to apply for the job, and I figured why not, I didn't think they would interview me), and somehow got the job. \n\n&gt; What are the positives?\n\nThis is highly dependent on where you do your PhD, what subject you're in, and who your supervisor is.\n\nFor me (and I want to stress that this is MY experience, and does not at all reflect the experience of anyone else),\n\n* I have a super awesome supervisor who's really supportive and understanding. This more than anything will affect your experience. If your supervisor sucks, it doesn't matter how amazing everything else is, your experience will likely still suck.\n\n* My institute at the university is really understanding. The head of the institute sent out a mass email today telling everyone that his primary concern is about everyone's health (both physical and mental). He literally wrote \"don't work too hard\". That says a lot about the culture of the institute, it's really friendly and supportive, I could not ask for better.\n\n* I get paid pretty well. NL is one of the best countries to do a PhD in. I make on par with a lot of my friends in the states (none of my CS friends mine you, but many of my non-CS friends). And I'm technically getting paid less in exchange for one day hopefully getting a PhD.\n\n* I have a lot of leeway to pick my own research. I have an overall subtopic that I have to stay within, but otherwise I'm almost completely free to pick what I want to study within that subtopic. A lot of PhDs will apply to a specific research topic, and that wasn't the case for me. I am able to tailor my research to my interests, which is great. I get to play with math all day, which is super fun for me.\n\n* Free coffee. I maintain that you can learn a lot about a place by its coffee policy. I instantly dislike companies that charge their employees for coffee. I get all the free coffee I want, which is fucking awesome. It's a little thing, but it means a lot to this coffee lover.\n\n* Supportive university. I know a lot of universities will hang their PhDs out to dry, especially in the US. My alma mater refuses to pay PhDs a decent wage, and at one point raised their pay .5% while also raising their fees by a couple thousand dollars which resulted in PhDs having LESS take home pay. That's bonkers to me. Compared to my university, which has a whole department just to help international staff (which I am) navigate immigration. I had to do nothing to immigrate to the Netherlands. There's also a department just focused on staff development, and I have access to a bunch of free skill development courses which is awesome. \n\nI'm having a really positive experience. Again, I'm in the minority, and it really is luck. I know a few other PhDs at this university, and many others are having a significantly worse time than me (bad supervisor, bad institute or both). It really does come down to luck. For a lot of people, a PhD is a huge struggle and an uphill battle.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/l1qygw/does_anybody_ever_enjoyed_doing_their_phd/gk3qz4u/"}, "3110": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "power2go3", "Date": 1611263500, "Score": 1, "Body": "Do you often find yourself distracted and alt tabbing when doing the analysis?

I know people who enjoyed it, I know people who didn't.  I know people who quit.  I know people who probably should have.  I enjoyed maybe 70% of my PhD journey.  You might not like it, but you NEED to recognize it for what it is: a training program / internship to be a professional researcher.\n\nThe main thing you're doing with a PhD is learning how to conduct research in your field and write something worth being published in a peer reviewed journal.  You do this by reading a lot of publications in your field, conducting research under moderate supervision, writing, and then defending your thesis.\n\nIf you want to remain in academia, you'll need some luck.  After your PhD you'll need to find a university somewhere to facilitate you continuing to do that whole thing again with slightly less supervision and a shorter timescale, plus you'll likely need to write the grant proposal also in addition to the research findings.  That's called a post-doc.  If you are able to stay on your lucky streak, you'll do this yet again, and again, and you might be relocating each time you finish a project.  Hopefully you are single or your partner doesn't care that they have to uproot every year or so.  If you stick with it long enough, one of those times you'll get a conditional employment offer that isn't temporary because a faculty job became open and you're pretty qualified at this point (having a CV that is more than just your PhD thesis).  If and when that happens, it's called tenure track.  If you keep up with your research at the pace and quality the rest of your colleagues approve of, eventually you'll get an unconditional employment offer.  That's called tenure.\n\nSince you're in a technical field it shouldn't be too hard for you to wrap your mind around some simple numbers.  Your potential future thesis advisor will supervise you and maybe 19 other PhDs before they retire.  When they retire, one job will be open and in theory, 20 of you will be qualified for that job.  If you look at the larger population you can extrapolate those averages.  This definitely means that you won't have good odds at staying in academia and it has little (notice I didn't say 'nothing', I said 'little') to do with how hard you work or how brilliant you are.  Is 5% ok with you?\n\nIf you don't get lucky enough to keep going in academia, you'll be out in the REAL WORLD \\*said in an ominous, etherial voice\\*.  There, when an HR person looks at your resume, your PhD will likely be looked at the same as if you took an internship somewhere for 3-5 years and then quit that job to do whatever you're applying for now.  They will also think you probably will need to get paid more because of your education so if you don't have any relevant skills, you'll probably get passed over a lot for people who have bachelors and masters degrees who have the same industry skills but won't need to be paid as much.  They might also think you're a flight risk and that you'll magically get an offer to be a professor (non-academics don't know how academia works) and just quit your job after they've trained you.  They might think that you'll be a flight risk after your experience 'catches up with your education', which is also stupid, but that's the world ... think of the average person and how dumb they are ... 50% are dumber than that!  (I borrowed that from a comedian, not sure who, but it wasn't original).  This doesn't mean you won't find a job, it just means it'll either be harder or you'll probably need to omit your PhD from the education section of your resume and call it something else under the employment section ... like researcher at XYZ University ... which is technically the truth, especially if you received a stipend.\n\nTeaching is one of the worst reasons to get a PhD.  If you enjoy teaching, go get a masters in the field you want to teach and try to get an adjunct position somewhere or teach at a community college or instead of a masters in your field, get a masters in education and teach high school.  Getting a PhD is for becoming a researcher; a small portion of your week \\~6-10 hours, 30 weeks a year just happens to be teaching some undergrads or first year grad students.  Your job is to research, not teach, although that doesn't mean you can be shit at teaching.\n\nI hope some of that helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/l1qygw/does_anybody_ever_enjoyed_doing_their_phd/gk3u68x/"}, "3114": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Wattouat13", "Date": 1611265562, "Score": 2, "Body": "Yes of course, because writing a program for analyzing the data is kinda boring, trying to find a meaning in your data is kinda boring etc...\n\nEl famoso experimentalist building  quantum  computer and doing stuff at LHC :)\n\nI also have the feeling that what I am doing is irrelevant and anybody could do it and that I'm useless but actually you've been chosen for a reason don't worry.

That is because they value the skills you developed learning to be an academic researcher: conducting a literature review, writing a proposal, designing experiments, conducting a survey, collecting data, analyzing data, writing up findings, presenting findings, etc...\n\nWill those skills be more valuable than, for example, a masters degree + 3 years of work experience on successful products?  I don't know, but I would imagine it depends on the role and the company.  I could see a lot of entry level R&amp;D positions not caring about the PhD since you'll likely be supervised by at least one person anyway, so the MSc-level skills are more important than your abilities to conduct research on your own.  By the time you have 5 years of experience doing that, I would imagine lots of places won't care about a PhD since you have the same skills at that point, in theory.\n\nSo I was mostly highlighting disadvantages to PhD before, but there are advantages.  One is that it's a terminal degree and that you shouldn't really be held back from any jobs in the future.  If for some reason you need a PhD for a job you really want and you have a masters, tough luck I guess.  I still think it would be strange to turn down hiring a solid person with MSc + years of experience in research or cutting-edge development just because they didn't have a PhD.  The Phd is just the equivalent of 3ish years of that experience anyway, only done at a university instead of at a company.  It's a bit more transparent since the thesis is likely public (not all are though) and has an implicit stamp of approval by other experts in the field (through the passing of a defense).\n\nMost jobs in the non-academic world that I've ever heard of or heard people talk about can be won with a masters + experience.  The closer the job is to doing research, the more a PhD will help, but the farther away it is from research, the less the PhD will matter and possible even hinder chances of getting the job.\n\nThe other question about dropping out of a PhD program: if you did fulfill the requirements for a masters on the way to the PhD, you should get one if you withdraw.  Chances are that you'll do the masters coursework before you start working on your thesis and it's likely that to get a masters you would just need to publish something resembling a masters thesis instead of a doctoral dissertation, so assuming you could turn whatever amount of research you've done into a masters-level thesis, you're likely going to get an MSc upon withdrawing from a PhD program.\n\nYou don't need to mention to any potential employer that you were even in a PhD program, honestly.  Then it would just look like you went to get a masters after your undergrad, which is totally normal.  Even if you were in a program for a year or two longer than a typical MSc and didn't finish the PhD ... were you receiving a stipend?  Well then you were technically getting paid to do research and/or teach ... so you did your masters and then stayed to work for a year.  Or if the date you received your MSc was when you decided to withdraw, you can just say you took a paid TA job while you worked part-time on your masters, which would make sense for the timeline.  You never need to tell anyone that you originally intended to get the PhD and then changed your mind for whatever reason.  You could talk about some of the stuff you were working on during an interview, but there's nothing wrong with just saying \"the work I was doing\" or \"the research I was doing\" or \"research I was helping with\" rather than \"my dissertation\".\n\nI think anybody who has either gotten a PhD or been in a PhD program would understand leaving a PhD program, but people in HR might look at it as a failure since you didn't finish what you started.  That's just my speculation of their ignorance though.  I mean, I look at it the same way as if somebody worked somewhere for a couple years then decided to leave.  Maybe that job or company wasn't a good fit for them and they realized it, then moved to something else; no big deal.  Academic research isn't for everybody and a surprising amount of people go straight from undergrad into a PhD program without fully knowing what they're training to do.  Lots of people just think it's becoming an expert at something, which, yeah it is, but honestly not all that much more than a masters degree + a couple years of work experience.  Loads are enamored by the title 'Doctor', which is very rarely used outside of academia.  I can count on a single hand the amount of times in 2020 somebody called me Dr. Xxxxxxx.  Many students are enamored by the PhD because all the people at the top of the academic world (which they've lived in their whole lives so far) have PhDs, so there is a perceived causal link between PhD and success/power.\n\nOoohh, one more perk I thought of is that it almost always gets you out of jury duty (applicable to people in the US).  If you use your Dr. title, an attorney will 99.999999% dismiss you during voir-dire because they don't like 'smart' and 'analytical' people on juries.  Other than a few scenarios, using your \"Dr.\" title will just make you look like a pompous ass.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/l1qygw/does_anybody_ever_enjoyed_doing_their_phd/gk7iy8t/"}, "3211": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "trogdor_999", "Date": 1611337060, "Score": 3, "Body": "Sometimes reviewers miss things or just don't read parts.

This was declared in the DL \"Decreto Rilancio\" last summer, and then again in Winter, due to the limitations caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. They guarantee 2 months and 3 additional months extensions, respectively. If you have a scholarship (borsa di dottorato), the extension also applies to your salary. If the issue is the money, you can still extend without compensation, and your deadline will be postponed. Were you aware of this? If not, definitely check with your university administration. The extension is yours by right. Sometimes universities also give another (unpaid) extension for the thesis (some months after the end of the PhD course). Nevertheless, if all of this fails, you still have a right to take an (unpaid) leave, in which your course is halted and you'll resume the months later. Check the rules for your faculty, but I'm pretty sure it's nationwide regulations.\n\nSecond of all: PhDs in Italy are a complete mess. The pay is miserable, the time is not enough and there's very little resources/fundings for how bad research is financed. That said, usually thesis evaluations are rather \"easy\", in the sense that nobody really expect a phd student to produce state of the art research in less than three years.

Not to sound full of myself, but I know I am a good writer and I've published before, so it's not like I'm clueless about scientific writing.

So, take what I'm writing with a grain of salt, because engineering is not my field. \n\n1 - \"I enjoy solving difficult problems; ones where the answer isn\u2019t clear and might not even exist.\" \n\nThis probably falls into the category I mentioned, probably there are better ways to achieve that goal than doing a PhD. It's probably better to do that without the commitment of a PhD. \n\nFor example, if there is a high chance of an answer not existing, and you're trying to do that during a PhD, your PhD journey can be hell. You may start missing deadlines because you don't get results, your advisor may be very annoyed, there may be increasing pressure regarding funding, etc. This is not a hobby, this is not just a degree. This is a job, and you are expected to deliver results. \n\n2 - \"I want to work on things that are technical and involve a lot of complex math.\"\n\nMaybe I'm wrong because I'm from a different field. \n\nBut what a lot of people would call \"complex math\" may be just \"basic math\" for many PhD students (e.g., calculus, linear algebra, real analysis). If you really want to get into complex math for PhDs, my guess is that your research is going to be very abstract and theoretical. At least that's what I see from the math wizards here. They are very close to pure math, sometimes not even including things like data analysis. And probably that's not good for industry jobs. \n\nI'm not sure what you meant by \"things that are technical\" but I probably wouldn't understand anyway.\n\n3 - \"Most of the jobs in industry that interest me require a masters or a PhD\"\n\nYeah, this is very different from my field. Requiring a masters is common in my field. But not a PhD.\n\n4 - \"I can\u2019t afford to get a masters\"\n\nDoing a PhD because you can't afford a masters sound like a bad idea. They are very different from each other. \n\nThere is a good chance that you will be able to afford a master by not doing a PhD just because you will probably earn much more money by working a normal job than doing a PhD with low income for years.\n\n5 - \"I know that I want to either pursue a technical job in industry or be a researcher.\"\n\nI think you should decide which one you want first. Even if you do a PhD, now knowing your goal is a really bad thing in my opinion. Because you should plan your PhD in a way that will help you with your goals. \n\nFor example, if you goal is a technical job, you should do some research that maximizes your chances for that kind of job. And, if your goal is to be a researcher, you should do some research that maximizes your chances for that kind of job. But if you don't know your goal, you may end up shooting yourself in the foot. \n\n6 - \"It sounds like I\u2019m going to prison\"\n\nI guess a better comparison is the decision to become a marine. You do it in the prime of your life. It's going to be hard, stressful, and test your own limits. You will also grow and get stronger. You are expected to become part of the elite in your field at the end, if you reach the end. Most people will never understand what you did. It will be very good if that's what you want for your life. If that's not what you want for your life, it can still bring you some benefits, but probably there are better ways to reap those benefits than being a marine.

For things like these, I step back and think, what could I have done differently? Should I have known better? How could I know about this matter if my own supervisor isn't guiding me? Like one time she was mad that I wasn't able to tell her about her grant. Guess fucking what, I just got hired as a research assistant (literally my first month), she didn't tell me about my job scope, didn't instruct any seniors to guide me, but then she blew up when I didn't know things.

Sometimes she spouts some stupid things that I know are stupid, so I kissed her ass and just don't do what she wants.\n\nTo be fair, I've also been surrounded by other proficient and professional professors (my supervisor is just an associate professor). Some things I learned from these great people:\n\n1. Your boss isn't always busy, you're just not their priority.\nOne professor once spent 5 minutes to explain about grants to me. And guess what, I've used that knowledge for years, because one prof decided it was worth teaching me in that short amount of time. My supervisor on the other hand always seems busy, but she's just bad at managing her time. When we do meet, the meeting doesn't provide anything useful for me.\n\n2. Professors can give good feedback on your work without being cruel or using unkind words. I've received feedbacks from professors with far more publications in high impact journals, and these people are kind and professional. They give constructive criticism to your work without personally attacking you as a person. My supervisor doesn't have that much publications but likes to talk like she knows better (and likes make offensive comments on my person if she's in a bad mood). That's also the reason why I'm always the corresponding author for my publications, because I know my supervisor ain't shit and doesn't know what she's doing.\n\n3. A good supervisor will guide you, or at least instruct someone to guide you.\nEspecially if you're just starting work. How could you possibly know everything on your own? If you're not guided, but you're expected to know things by yourself, then the supervisor is the problem.\nEven if your supervisor doesn't know some things, they should still know of someone (another prof, another student, or staff) who can help you. Or at least, they should try to find someone to help you.\n\n\nOk enough rambling for today.\n\nI hope you'll be better in your PhD journey.

Another helpful tip would be to look for industry sponsored grants. I'm in Canada, so these examples will probably not apply to you but I guarantee your country has something similar. Many grad students here will just apply to government grants like NSERC, CIHR, OGS. There are a TON of other grant opportunities that allow you to partner with industry like Mitacs and and OCE. With OCE I was funded quite well for 3 years and the grant ensures you spend 25% of your time working with an industry partner that you choose.\n\nLast tip, learn how to code.

A \"top program\" might matter a lot for bachelors degrees, since it will directly correlate with your ability to get a job. It matters less for a masters since it doesn't really impact your ability to get jobs all that much, and it really only has an impact if you want to get a PhD.\n\nAs for the PhD itself, the quality of the \"program\" doesn't make a difference. You do research, there isn't a \"program\" to go along with it. The quality of your research depends on a lot of factors, such as how good you are at doing research, how much your supervisor hampers you, and how much funding is available to you.\n\nAs for post-PhD, the school you got a PhD from (provided it's a legit institution) doesn't matter all that much. Staying in academia largely depends on your past work and on your relationships (both things you can build at a \"lesser\" school). As for industry, all any hiring manager will see is the \"PhD\", where it came from doesn't matter as much.\n\nSo this isn't a tradeoff at all. Really the only tradeoff is that in the US, PhDs can be started right after a bachelors and can include masters work, so a stipend can be received for effectively doing a masters. While in Europe, most people do a separate masters first and then get a PhD.

I didn't actually go to any lawyer, but I demonstrated that I knew my rights and that I was willing to use them. Maybe you could research what your specific rights are and what safety nets you have available? Just in case.\n\nEdit: you can also try to \"manipulate\" them. Like tell them that something is difficult to do, when you actually know how to do it. Tell them you're still reading about something.

It is common to leave the office at 12-13 on Friday, and by Friday at 15 you will see sooo many cars with people headed to their cabins in the mountains for the weekend.

The general gist of it is that the Norwegian side is more productive, efficient, and happier and that there\u2019s no way a Norwegian is gonna hang around at work until late at night (like - after 17) because their American boss expects that no one leaves until he/she does.  \n\nI once spent a year working in a Norwegian team alongside American teams, and they wasted so much time, got so little done, and had so many inefficient methods of working which really affected their work.

Maybe something you don't want to hear, but I've also noticed PhDs that haven't published to have some glaring problems moving forward when going into a postdoc.\n\n---\n\nIs it an academic \"failure\"?\n\nThat really depends on what your next job/position is after the PhD and what it entails.  If it's non-academic (e.g. something policy related or whatnot), might not be a huge problem as long as you have the relevant experience and proof of expertise.\n\nAs a postdoc, I mean nowadays it's not, but typically PIs that are hiring those that haven't published are looking for bodies to do experiments rather than looking for quality of people to grow their careers.\n\n---\n\nIs it a red flag when applying to postdocs?  \n\nPersonally speaking, this is a huge red flag, for me at least.  There's of course exceptions to this rule, but publishing in a peer-reviewed journal means you have produced work of at least a certain quality that has been scrutinized by the greater community.  It signifies at least an end to a chapter.\n\nFrom my experience, PhDs that haven't published a manuscript, even a small one, haven't done so for a reason.  That usually entails a lack of quality of work, an inability of following through on projects, absence of larger picture thinking, or reflects an inability to produce.  It's a glaring hole that signifies a lack of training, for whatever reason, be it the fault of the PI or the candidate.  I've also found these types of individuals to also be poorer writers/communicators in general for one reason or another.  Unless you're working on a publication in Cell with 3 other authors and your PI isn't letting you release it without something perfect (which is a different shitty scenario), not having ANY papers is really suspect for me.\n\nThat said, typically I've seen PhDs that haven't published are often are at least competent technically.  They are often are at least good with their hands, with some set technique or set of techniques.  But quite frankly, I look at it as someone that's had an extensive Masters experience, not a PhD.\n\nI bring this up because if you don't have the right skills to set yourself for a postdoc, you may end up really getting pigeon-holed *during* your postdoc.

That said, you mentioned wanting position key words...(warning, I'm US based and assuming the same for you which may not be true but IDK)\n\nIn **industry** you might want to look into \"medical affairs\" roles, or titles like clinical research associate/coordinator/scientist. You may be interested in \"digital therapeutics\" (it looks like there are multiple companies in that space working in trauma) and telemedicine/teletherapy companies, since both are booming right now--maybe with R&amp;D roles, maybe with medical/clinical affairs roles. You could also be interested in being a \"medical science liaison\" (someone who works for a company as a subject matter expert, maintaining relationships with clinicians and keeping track of field leaders). There may be consulting roles that are a good fit for you, but I'm less familiar with those, or roles as a research manager within a hospital or healthcare system. \n\nIn **government**, you might find positions within the VA (could be a good choice for internship), military, DOD. There may be other research positions within NIH, or more administrative ones that will keep you close to the science but not really doing it, like being a scientific program officer (if you want to go the NIH route, I've heard that postdoc-ing there is one of the best \"ins\").\n\n**Nonprofits** can be a little more topic-driven, and it might make sense to just spend some time pulling together a list of all the nonprofits that do work you find interesting and every so often browsing their job openings pages. \n\nLastly, if what you really want to do is a combination of clinical work, research, and teaching, it sounds like you *want* to be a professor, and you shouldn't be afraid to go for that! Yes, it's hard, but it's not impossible. If you're just now wrapping up your masters, start working on your [fellowship applications](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships) *now*--there are private options available too for non-citizens.

You can do a postdoc in industry. Pay, benefits, and work-life balance are a lot better as an industry postdoc compared to academia in my experience.

You will be competing with people that have postdoc experience and are desperately trying to get out of academia. Having been on the hiring side, most of the people that get \"entry level\" PhD roles have postdoc experience. Postdoc experience usually equals more experience in general.

I\u2019m learning from this book how to be more accepting of my mom\nand what good she can and does offer me, which is actually quite lot. I\u2019m also trying to be more accepting of myself.\n\nA radical acceptance perspective would suggest accepting and experiencing the hurt, shame, anger, whatever it is you feel about not having the validation you want \u2014 \u201cinviting those feelings to tea\u201d, and respecting them as your reality and experience. Respecting reality frees us from longing for the impossible. From there it becomes possible to look for the validation we seek in other places (in friends, in mentors).\n\nAlso, I find my mom doesn\u2019t ask questions about work because she doesn\u2019t understand it. This perception leads me to avoid talking about work and thus we establish a pattern of behavior. But is it true that I don\u2019t have any work experiences where she has room to share insights/perspective? \n\nI dunno. I guess I\u2019m trying to say you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way.

I don\u2019t know if this helps you but as nobody has answered so far, I share this story with you to show you are heard and there is somebody understanding the pain (somehow) you\u2019re going through. I made a quite similar experience during my bachelor program where I had to hand in a scientific paper each year with my bachelor thesis being the third one. These scientific papers had to be done during internships at a big company. \n\nSo the first internship was quite chaotic in terms of the scientific paper as my supervisor has not really thought about something I could write about before the internship and as it was my first scientific paper I had not clue what I could write about. At my first day there, I approached my supervisor again asking him for a topic as I had to tell the university in advance what I would write about and the due date for this was close. He then came up with something which he has not really thought through and as inexperienced as I was I just accepted the topic. Three months go on, and I basically got hardly any support from him, just at the end he asked how far I came and offered me that he would read through it once it\u2019s finished. In the end, it was more of an huge advertisement for the company\u2018s products than a scientific paper and I felt like I wasted my time while my colleagues at university were working on really fancy topics. \n\nThen second year came together with the next scientific paper. This time It was quite good although I was still completely uninspired what to write about. My internship was really fun and I learned a lot through both my work and the paper but again the topic was nothing special. Again I envied my colleagues who worked on a far more technical topic (I am working in CS). \n\nSo final year arrives and I had to start thinking about my bachelor thesis. This time I knew quite early what I wanted to write about. It was a very innovative topic about an early stage technology but in retrospective, it was far too ambitious for the knowledge and skill set i had during that time (not mentioning the lack of time). So I approached somebody who was some kind of SME for the technology but not for the specific topic I wanted to do. He tried to supervise me as much as possible but in the end, he reached a point where he just couldn\u2019t help me anymore. Although I was able to implement *something* my paper was not as unique and innovative as I had dreamed of. Also at the end, I had hardly time for writing the thesis as the implementation has required most of the available time. As a result, I got a really bad grade for my bachelor thesis and it now follows me everywhere, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s when I am applying for a job or master programs. If I could turn back time I would have prolonged the time I had for the bachelor thesis although it would have meant to study longer.\n\nI was wondering if there is a possibility for you to prolong your phd program (especially in terms of Corona). At the university where I am currently doing my master, they do not count the \u201ccorona semesters\u201d.\n\nI hoped it helped and that you will find a solution to your current situation.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/l89wo3/i_was_so_close_to_having_some_success_for_once/glbnwu0/"}, "4221": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bs-scientist", "Date": 1611973854, "Score": 2, "Body": "People that go to A&amp;M are crazy about people who also went to A&amp;M.

I completed my coursework in 2 years like the rest of my cohort, though, by taking a few classes over the summer for my specialization. I'm now in year 5 and have finally moved on past candidacy after 2.5 years of next-to-no progress. \n\nFor me, the coursework phase was much easier than the self-directed phase afterwards because it's easy for me to conform to external deadlines, but much harder to stick to my self-imposed ones. I also probably burnt myself out after working so intensely during coursework and then just didn't have anything left as I started into the self-directed phase after I completed coursework. There's more flexibility outside of coursework, but that makes it harder for me to prioritize school over work.  \n\nAnother thing that was really challenging was having a job that was completely separate from my studies. The brain switching that was required to move between my work and my studies was really tough because there was very little overlap. I switched jobs about a year ago to a research associate role in a related content area to my studies and it's made a world of difference.  I don't do school during work time, but some of the research I'm doing is related to what I'm focused on so my brain doesn't have to live in two completely separate worlds anymore.\n\nI don't know how the university you're planning to attend manages things, but my school isn't particularly used to part-time students. As a result, they didn't have a process for assigning me an advisor or research mentor or anything like that because I couldn't have a research assistantship while working. Initially it wasn't a big deal because I could do a bit of work with lots of different people, but once I hit the phase where I needed committee members and a chair and advisor, I pretty much had to start from scratch where my cohort mates had them built in.  \n\nAll in all, I'd probably do it again, but I might go about things a little differently and I would definitely know more about what to ask and get put in place early on. By the time everything's done, I'll probably finish up about 9 months behind the last full-time member of my cohort and 18 months behind the first. It's certainly possible and, I may be biased, but I certainly think the quality of my work is just as good as that of my cohort mates, and sometimes better because I have the perspective of practice experience to enhance it.\n\nFor full disclosure and more context, I also have a young kid at home (he was 1 when I started) and I'm the primary wage earner for my family, though I do have some child care help from my partner and family.
