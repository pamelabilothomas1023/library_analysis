However, they are (these days) considered nearly mandatory for obtaining a faculty position at institutions ranging from R1's to SLAC's. The reason for this is that a PhD involves training in how to do research, how to write papers, and how to write (usually smaller) grant proposals. However, there is little to no training in managing budgets or managing students (beyond undergrad workiers) and dissertation research training is fairly niche. Going through a post-doc will allow for more independent research to be conducted at a higher volume and with greater responsibility than a doctoral program allows or is intended to provide. Post-docs are given greater responsibility in student training, managing budgets and projects, and idea formation/actualization. Additionally, a post-doc provides an opportunity to learn new skills and move beyond their very niche dissertation topics, which will allow them to come up with better and bigger ideas to bring in those NSF/NIH grants that will be necessary for tenure at R1/2's or to provide better depth for what would be possible in terms of research productivity at a SLAC. These will become invaluable to a faculty member who will be running their own lab. This is even true at SLAC's, as there will often be fewer resources and less support for research than one would find at an R1 or R2 institution.\n\nPost-docs are also often popular for those wanting to get into industry as dissertations are often quite theoretical and industry positions are quite practical. A post-doc may allow a student to get more and better experience at practical research skills before becoming a better fit for an industry position. There are arguments on the validity of this claim, however, and if industry is your goal, I would suggest networking and simply asking employers what skills they are looking for.\n\nThat being said, I am finishing my PhD and am not going to be doing a post-doc position. This is because I am not interested in continuing on in research and am looking for a teaching position at a community college or teaching institution where publication is not required for tenure promotion (or simply does not have a tenure system in place).

Today, frankly speaking, a postdoc is often the default holding pattern position while a person figures out how competitive they think they'll be applying for a faculty position.  Many people use their postdoc experience to decide if they want to continue in academic research (apply for a faculty position) or change directions after the postdoc (find a job outside academia) based on how their research goes and if they get grants.  Unfortunately, many people neglect career development opportunities during their postdoc, which can seriously hurt and demoralize them if they decide (as the majority of PhDs do these days) to leave academic research afterwards.\n\nWhat field are you in?  Consider what kind of career you're interested in after your training, as postdoctoral fellowships are essentially trainee positions, and may be either essential for your career, or a colossal waste of time.  All depends on what you're studying, and where you'd like to be and do in life.\n\nGiven the unforgiving funding and academic hiring situation in many countries today, it's beneficial for most people in academic research trainee positions to pause and consider if they're spending at least some of their time on a Plan B or C on a regular basis.\n\nAlso a note: don't only take the word of those in your PhD program; many if not most faculty do not communicate with those outside academia and have very different priorities than you may wish to adopt for your own career development.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_5ns32y.json"}, "163": {"Subreddit": "WitchPhD", "Author": "Snowkid1", "Date": 1484374300, "Score": 1, "Body": "So beautiful.

Your aim in this chapter is to draw a donut of related work, the hole in the middle is where your work fits. With a complete background chapter, you'll need to now rework all the references to related work in your main chapters to the background chapter, and again integrate them into the larger argument of the dissertation rather than the smaller (and simpler argument) of the paper(s). \n\n3) Then you'll need to expand all the text to make it a little bit more accessible. Papers are typically aimed at an expert audience who are knowledgable of the field the related work. PhD dissertations should be aimed at a good masters student level who is about to start phd work. So the audience is quite different and a lot more detail is needed. \n\n4) Then you'll need to write a chapter conclusion, which is bigger than a paper conclusion and again fits in the larger argument of the dissertation (note: conclusion is not a summary, it should include \"concluding\" statements. Something like: \"In this chapter I hypothesised that X and proved that Y. I therefore CONCLUDE that X is is function of Y\". )\n\n5) And you may need to redo all of your graphs/figures for A4 format (papers in my field are typically 2 column format)\n\nOnce you've done all that work, your chapter will be pretty unrecognizable from the paper.
