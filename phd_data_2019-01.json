Is this a new thing? \n\nMy advice regardless: If you ultimately want to do a PhD, I would go to a bigger in state school for your bachelors degree and skip the masters degree if possible. You should definitely take Core classes and/or foundational courses at community college to save money, but the larger colleges are going to offer more valuable experiences for you. One prime example I can think of is undergraduate research positions. These are highly valuable when pursuing a doctoral degree. It\u2019s never too early to start looking into the types of research a university is outputting. It\u2019s also not a bad idea to email professors whose research interests you and ask them if they would be willing to take undergraduate volunteers or research assistants. Worst case scenario, they say no. Best case scenario, you get a research position and get to see what the day to day involves. \n\nI say to skip the masters degree if you intend to pursue a PhD because:\n\n1. PhDs are paid for. Personally, my program pays my tuition (up to the full time student requirement) and gives me almost $2K/month in a living stipend. This covers my rent, groceries, gas, etc. it\u2019s not a glamorous life, but it allows me to work significantly less than I would have to if I were doing a masters. Masters student, traditionally, are not guaranteed to be paid for. Many do get awarded scholarships or Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships that cover their tuition and a small stipend. But this isn\u2019t guaranteed with acceptance like it is for the majority of PhDs. \n\n2. At the masters level, there is significantly more focus on the coursework. This is because masters degrees are intended to give students with a bachelors degree a more focused education within a specific subset of a field to prepare them for a particular job. Most masters students will move on to analyst/managerial/mid-level positions within their chosen field. PhDs have less emphasis on the coursework. This is because the coursework is there to provide the skills we need to execute our research, which is the end goal. For example, my program teaches us all how to program in SAS and use R Studio. However, in our field, PhDs rarely have to code. We have to know how it needs to be done, but the actual coding will be handed off to an analyst - who probably has a masters degree. For this reason, we really only take classes for the first 2-3 years of our program. Then we do research full time. \n\n3. Most PhD programs will award you a masters degree after you pass your qualifiers (2 years in after your mandatory coursework). If you decide that a PhD is no longer your goal after 2 years, you can still leave the program with your masters. And your first 2 years will have been paid for. \n\nI hope that helped clarify your decision a little bit. Last thing to keep in mind - you\u2019re in the 11th grade. I am absolutely not saying that your aspirations are Immature or unrealistic. What I am saying is that over the next 3-5 years, your interests, your goals, and aims will shift and change and solidify a LOT more. Don\u2019t feel the need to make a decision right away. Keep looking for new experiences in academia, whether they\u2019re appealing to you right away or not. You never really know when something is going to \u201cclick.\u201d\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/acbj17/is_a_phd_in_neurobiology_worth_it/ed806ln/"}, "111": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "KleineKeizer", "Date": 1546609800, "Score": 1, "Body": "A think a screenshot of a template will suffice for most.

I chose computer science engineering. In the first year, you have to study courses on all different types of engineering - we had courses on mechanical, civil, electrical and even workshop. I did decently well in all the subjects other than the ones related to computer science. Dropped out in second year.  \n\nLife changed for me then. I went to a very liberal government college and studied literature. Did all right there. In the final year of my undergraduate course, I sat for an all India entrance examination to do my masters in a reputed and a very sought after Indian college. Guess what - couldn't get through. Tried next year - got through and was very intimidated in the environment. Weirdly, I topped first semester and the next and the next. By this time, I really wanted the gold medal. You get one if you top all 4 semesters or are the topper on a cumulative score. I gave it a decent shot while applying for GRE and applying for PhD.

I am sure there were better students but some how I made it through. I stayed almost top of the cohort throughout coursework and when it came to the qualification exams the professors seemed confident that I will sail through. It was quite a feat for me because I had dived headlong into quantitative research, something I had little idea of beforehand. I failed the qualifiers! A lot of people fail the quant section of the exams, I passed that and failed the theory section.  I failed the section people pretty much ace all the time.  \n\nI have seen a lot of my friends go through the PhD process. Some of them were very solid students throughout their undergrads and masters. A shockingly large number of them failed out of the PhD process. They just broke when they could not pass the qualifiers / comprehensives at one go. I always tell myself that all the failures in my life trained me for this one moment in life. I took the theory exam on the second attempt and cleared and I finished that section strong.

He is in first year studying economics and has the same problem as you do.

It\u2019ll be tough going but I think finishing the thesis in that time is totally doable, you\u2019ll need to really push yourself but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be worth it in the end! \n\nI\u2019d speak to your supervisor as well about how you\u2019ve been feeling to explain why you might not have everything they were expecting for the meeting, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand giving how good a student you are and what you\u2019ve had to go through already. And you should visit your doctor as well about your depression. In fact that should probably be first on your list of things to do, it could be the kick start you need to get the writing going again. \n\nSo basically, I don\u2019t think you should walk away and deep down I don\u2019t think you want to either. You should seek help for the depression first and foremost though whether it be through your doctor or supervisor/faculty, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll want to do what they can to help you finish the thesis too.\n\nBest of luck with everything, I\u2019m rooting for you!

I'm going through a similar rough period as I near the end of my program. Some good advice I've been given is:\n\n1. Break tasks up into smaller, manageable goals (example, the 1100 words each day that jumpUpHigh suggested). Visualize each small effort (even just formatting references, reviewing a lesson plan,etc.) as its own victory, which it is. They add up in surprising ways.\n2. Find some way to give yourself a hard disconnect from work life to allow yourself to recharge. It could be taking an hour to read a pleasure book, or get a work out in, or maybe just a nap. But give yourself some type of scheduled (that's the key, put it in your calendar) \"you\" activity in order to recharge the batteries. During this time, you are responsible for nothing other than your own comfort.\n3. Sit with yourself a moment, and think about which aspect (writing, teaching, meetings) stresses you the most. That is your mind's top priority. Do something small to address it, it may help improve your focus on other sections.\n\nMost importantly, as others have said, you are SO close!

It's healthier and cheaper cuz I don't resort to takeout on days that I am working hard. I will often listen to music, podcasts, talk to someone, etc, while I cook. It's a great activity for introverts to recharge too, if that's important to you.\n\nI also sometimes clean my apartment when I feel like I need to take time off work.

Joined a lab on three conditions, where the third condition was that I could do any project I want. I really liked the research topic of my lab and saw so many multidisciplinary opportunities. I came into my PhD with the mindset that I would learn both computational and wetbench chemistry and bioinformatics, though my background was at the bench with some user-level bioinformatics. My lab has very strong collaborations with computational groups, so the initial agreement was that I would be able to work hands-on with these collaborators with my own projects. Everything seemed great when I joined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving been in the lab for over a year now, I am getting zero guidance even on the research that my lab normally does. I have no spare time because all of my efforts and energy are devoted to the research questions that my advisor has assigned me. I don't mind those research questions, but when I want to put my own twist on them so that both of our interests are satisfied, my advisor shuts me down. Very similar to how your advisor doubts that you have done the experiment properly, my advisor refuses to accept anything I say as truth. Even when I have brought up a point to consider behind experimental design flaws, my advisor chooses to ignore it and tell me in my face that I am wasting my time worrying, only for them to bring it up 3 months later when it is has become a bigger deal. I find myself constantly waiting around hoping that I can get to the types of research that excited me to do a PhD, the research that I was promised only within my current lab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had multiple conversations with my advisor about developing myself in the ways I had outlined in my personal statement, only for each of these encounters to be cast aside. Reading your post was so painful, as I have literally scoured the internet for the past year hoping that someone else was experiencing the same issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing is worse than slaving away in a PhD program where everything you do does not serve your first interests. I had nightmares about interactions with my advisor and became stressed just entering lab. It got to the point where I lost motivation and a sense of excitement to do any work at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I'm sharing all this is that it forced me to speak with the Graduate Director of my program. He and I spoke for a while one morning where I tried to vaguely circle around the issues that I had been having with my advisor. Sucks that if you provide what an officer might perceive as a 'formal complaint' that an investigation would have to follow, guaranteeing that no one will talk about these kinds of things except for on Reddit. Bottom line, he told me that it is inherent to the PhD structure that graduate students become frustrated by their advisors. The power differential in a graduate program favors the advisor almost always. He cautioned me that while the issues we are dealing with when it comes to these 'catfishing' advisors are worth fighting, the timing of when to pick the fight is most crucial. He and I spoke about working around trivial problems in lab situations (broken machine, no data, long method, long hours, lazy collaborators, etc.), but he felt that the issue where the student is being prevented from being innovative and developing as a scientist is serious. The worst part about it is, by the time of your preliminary exam, your committee will probably be able to understand the tension coming from your situation. But regardless of whether they sympathize with you, the blame will only fall on you and not your advisor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe told me that to fight this fight, you need to be in a position of power. Whether this be having secured a fellowship so that you have the freedom to do whatever the hell you want or to have a significant amount of work to hold over your advisor's head. Without leverage, you have the potential of destroying any relationship you have with your advisor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the feeling where you are holding on to the potential to do something amazing that maybe only your lab can offer. I also know the defeat of having your advisor tell you your focus should be elsewhere because your ideas are not feasible, when they definitely are and are the primary reason that you joined your lab. I am sticking it out a little bit longer until after my prelim exam so that I can make my best decision, where I can either make things work or jump ship. I am hoping that my advisor makes good on their word, and that maybe after prelim I will be able to do what I was promised once I have accumulated enough data to satisfy other projects and prove my worth. But, these sentences are conditional and my advisor's behavior is very inconsistent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou're not alone in this fight, but the internet will not be able to tell you when is the right time to make a decision, and what the right decision is (trust me, I've read every Reddit, Quora, GradCafe thread). You are not wasting your time, because, like me, you have probably solidified your true interests through all of this bullshit and have learned some skills that no one else in the field of your interest will possess. Stay strong and stay positive. Trust yourself, as you are the only person capable of changing your own life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s. I created a Reddit account just so I can comment on this.

Its a horrible truth that early days of a PhD is scrambling around trying to not feel like a fraud.\n\nIn fact look up \"imposter syndrome\" and you'll see it's a reality throughout our careers. \n\nI agree with the above comment that you need to refine your topic. \"find the gap\" as is so often said. And this is done with the literature review. The first year will focus on the literature review and come to a question at the end, but the review will continue until the end of the whole PhD.\n\nIn terms of what \"field\" digital transformation is featured in, I would argue that it will be continued to be researched in more and more fields and it proliferate across industries. So if you cannot find much about it done in business economics that is a good thing! Your \"original contribution\" can be bringing topics together.\n\nIn terms of writing a paper, I would say in your first year work towards a conference paper. This is more realistic, and more accepting of literature review papers from young academics. You can look into the idea of a \"systematic review\" which some students can find very helpful to structure their work (I didn't do one, it didn't seem appropriate for my work).\n\nA statematic review of the term \"digital transformation\" I imagine will get A LOT of results. So find ways to cut down the papers. But I have seen not so great quality research that limits the papers they read too greatly at the expense of actually identifying any significant trends. However, this could be a way of justifying your topic/area/question before moving forwards to methodology.\n\nIn terms of methods, I agree with the comment that says to read up on them. This can take a long time to really get your head around (I am in Project Management after am engineering undergraduate, and had no research experience nevermind qualitative so I had to start from scratch). Saunders has a good intro book for research methods for business students - I forget the full name.\n\nMy gut would say that qualitative or mixed methods would get you something interesting on your focus on how things have CHANGED. I would also be interested in WHY things have changed.\n\nYou could get these answers at a later stage in your research, maybe through archival/discourse analysis of company documents or interviews with professionals who have experienced the change.\n\nBut for your literature review.... You need to get to the point of knowing what questions you want to ask.... Then figure out how you will answer them (what data collection could prove your conclusions right, or throw up new things you hadn't though about?)\n\nSome comments of what I read from your title....\n\n- you say \"change\" of using IT\nLook at organisational/ behavioural change\n\n- as things change over time\nHistory of technology / sociology of technology\n\n- the new era we are in\n4th Industrial revolution (I forget the more catchy term people use)\n\n- is technology shaping society, or does society shape technology? Why some things fail?\nSocial Construction of Technology (SCOT) - I am of the school of though that human behaviour shapes our technology, and the interaction of tech and non-tech is really significant. I would personally be reading down this route (but thats to do with my personal philosophy of interpretivist, you can read about in Saunders' book)\n\nI hope you found any of this useful, but as it is your project you can listen to advice from lots of places and chose what feels right for you. \n\nThere is no such thing as the right or wrong way to do it!! Remind yourself of this when the inevitable self doubt sets in. \n\nIm happy to share more from my own experiences if you think it would help. I'm going off the assumption that Project Management and Business Economy may overlap enough. \n\nBest of luck! \n", "Permalink":

Describe what files on your computer are associated with the task that day. If you're like me and you use many different software programs, it can save so much time if you have clear instructions that can jog your memory. I have written a placeholder for many terms with hyphens, e.g. -variable name- to demonstrate that I use this level of specificity in all of my entries. \n\n**Formatting Tips**\n\n* Placeholders in the template, e.g., -variable name- demonstrate that I use this level of specificity in all of my entries. Any variable names or file names should be spelled EXACTLY the same way every time. Do not get lazy and allow typos to persist. This way, you can use CTRL+F to find any and all occurrences of a variable or file. This is invaluable when you are writing a manuscript, reporting back to your advisor, or putting together your dissertation.\n* For names of files on my computer, I use this format: \"**MM.DD.YY\\_FileName.ext**\" e.g., \"**12.15.18\\_GIS\\_parcel.R**\". The quotation marks and extension let me know that this is a file that I can search for exactly in my computer, email, or drives. The bold helps me to quickly skim the entry and find the associated files.\n* All of my meeting minutes with my advisor (or collaborators) are in their own Word documents labeled as \"**MM.DD.YY\\_AdvisorName\\_meeting.docx**\". I take these notes either during or immediately after my meetings so that I capture all of the items we discussed, including my advisor's feedback, comments, etc. This helps keep my captain's log less bloated. If I wrote in my physical notebook during the meeting, I copy those notes over into a Word document ASAP and log the meeting as an entry in my captain's log.\n* If you did multiple things in one day (meeting, field work, writing, reading), those are all separate entries. If you did data analysis in Software A in the morning and then more data analysis in Software B in the afternoon, those are also separate entries.\n\nAlthough it's easy to see this spreadsheet as a place to log experiments and research activity, **it's also a place to document other aspects of a PhD** that don't necessarily relate to the findings. There's no such thing as a trivial entry. Here are just a few examples (based on real experiences from me or my peers):\n\n* You drove 4 hours each way to attend an important event at your host campus.\n* You spent half a day chasing down committee members across campus in attempts to finally schedule your defense date.\n* You went to a public speaking workshop geared towards engineers.\n* You went to 3 different offices on campus trying to figure out what happened to your funding and what paperwork you need to do now.\n* You process a week's worth of reimbursements and receipts for a conference you attended.\n* You wrote and submitted a grant application.\n* You spent a whole day finding stock photos, powerpoint templates, and customizing your powerpoint presentation to look pretty.\n* You went back and forth with co-authors in an email chain with 20+ emails in 1 day.\n* You went shopping for business clothes for your next big presentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have seen too many professors and graduate students struggle to find files or remember when they did something. This simple format helped me tons of times when I had to remember what I did a year ago and pull up a document or redo an analysis. Plus it keeps you sane when you feel like you have made zero progress because you can look back and see all the work you did. If you diligently organize and log your activities and files, I guarantee you will thank yourself in the future.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/adyfcz/research_diarycaptains_log_template_requested_post/edl3679/"}, "352": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ThatCRAPPYPLAYER", "Date": 1546981470, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you!

They're there to educate, so teaching experience will be seen more positively.\n\nAlso, from a more long term view, if you stay in academia, you will have to teach at some point.

Save yourself and your future students the pain and suffering of a teacher who doesn't want to be there. Sadly, we've all had them precisely because of the attitude your faculty member espoused. \n\nIf I could reform one thing about academia, it would be the devaluation of teaching and the refusal to teach future PhDs how to teach.

You are already showing signs of messing it up when you say you don't have as much material as you like.  The #1 mistake is people take too long, go over the time limit, or get cut off to keep the time limit.  You only have 15 minutes.  5 of those minutes will be lost saying \"hello, this is me\" and \"thanks, any questions?\"  So you only have 10 minutes to say anything substantial.  You know that's barely enough to outline your ideas, nevermind going into depth.  A 15 minute presentation is nothing more than \"here's a rough outline of my idea, if you find this interesting, talk to me at the next break.\"  Don't do flowery introductions or worry about being \"interesting\" - this is not entertainment, it's education.  The audience is there because they already love the topic, so just give them the substance.\n\nOther important rules:\n\nIf using slides - DO NOT READ THEM OUT - nothing is more boring than that.\n\nDon't put anything of substance on the slides - the audience will be reading them instead of listening to you.  Then they'll blame you for being confusing when really they weren't listening.  The slides should contain reminders for your talking points, charts, illustrations and other items which people can do without, but which make your talk more informative, or which you want to directly discuss.  Many presenters don't bother with slides.   Most of my slides are nothing more than pretty pictures, or the occassional chart.  If appropriate, classical artwork is pretty, royalty-free and makes you look sophisticated.\n\nWork on one slide per 4-5 min talk.  That means 3-4 slides, 5 MAX.\n\nWrite the whole script, and read it out to the audience.  Until you are experienced, this guarrantees you don't forget anything, ensures your ideas are in a coherent sequence, and ensures you keep to time.  Start on the basis of 125 words per minute.  Read it out exactly as you would in the conference, which is SLOWER than normal speech, and time it.  Cut the text if you are going over time (which you almost certainly will). Keep reading it out until you have it down to 13-14 min, as you are almost guarranteed to take longer once there are people in front of you and slides to click, etc.  I am ruthless with myself over this, and frequently get a nice comment from the moderator about being exactly on time.  This builds a reputation which can open doors for other presentations because people know you can be counted on to deliver substance while staying on time.  Being perfectly on time while saying something worthwhile makes you look super professional.\n\nRehearse this script over and over so you only have to glance at it when presenting.  This way you can look up at the audience as you read.  No one wants to look at the top of your head while you mutter into your paper.\n\nMake eye contact with members of the audience.  You are NEVER talking to them ALL.  In  your mind you are talking to one person only.  You just keep switching which one person it is.  Say a few words to them.  Switch to someone else on the other side of the audience.  Say a few words to them.  Everyone within 10 feet of that person will feel like you are looking at them.\n\nDecide on ONE thing you want the audience to learn.  Tell them what you will say, then set its background, then discuss it, then summarise your points.  If any time left, tell them what you just said (because half of them were reading their email while you were talking).\n\nCheck your volume.  Many speakers are inaudible at the back.  Get someone to test you, preferably in the room you'll be presenting.  Depending on audience size, remember that people are sound buffers, so you'll need to SPEAK UP.\n\nIf you are using citable material, close with a final slide of formal citations.  Have that list on printed paper so you can offer it to the audience in case they want to follow up on anything.  They rarely do, but it solidifies the impression you've done solid research, makes people much more reluctant to challenge you, and - once in a while - leads to a really useful \"hey, if you've been reading these guys, you'd just love XYZ\"\n\nDon't worry about being nervous - unless it is stopping you from breathing, it's really useful.  The skill is to channel the nerves into focus and performance.  My worst presentations were the ones I was totally relaxed for.  Many politicians drink loads of water before giving a speech.  They channel the desperation to go to the toilet into energy for their talking.  Nerves are good, unless they overwhealm you.\n\nFinally - have fun.  The audience will be polite, and for 15 min, you get to talk and everyone else, even Nobel Prize winners and Full Professors, have to shut up and listen to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ag08hw/first_conference_talk/ee53kky/"}, "616": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "caramul", "Date": 1547581428, "Score": 3, "Body": "I was going to ask what country you are in - I see you say Netherlands and want to go to Sweden, I think this is similar to the UK.\n\nI would say for a field in which you can build practical experience, such as cancer research, a postdoc can definitely make you more valuable to industry. In fact, depending on your lab experience in your PhD you could be in a good position already.\n\nIf you view your PhD as essentially 3 years of training and experience in a field - like and appreciticeship as opposed to just school - you will see you do have a lot of experience as it is.\n\nIn terms of options, I agree it is most likely easier to move abroad for a postdoc. Just try to make sure you will build practical skills and not have lots of teaching committments if that is your desire.\n\nA friend of mine works in nuclear fusion - and area, like cancer research, is research focused even in industry. She is now on her second postdoc in international research institutes. These may be very competitive, but if you could find some they will be a good cross over from academia to industry.\n\nFailing all else, it is not uncommon for PhDs in the UK to get jobs at a graduate level (same as other undergraduates).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ag82gh/postdoc_or_industry_advice_needed/ee54rhw/"}, "617": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Downtown_Perspective", "Date": 1547582007, "Score": 3, "Body": "No books, but just completing PhD (thesis submitted) at age 60, while holding down fulltime job.\n\nDo the PhD just like any other job.  Allocate formal working hours, set schedules and delivery dates.  If you have project management experience, do a gantt chart for the thesis development.\n\nUnderstand this will be tougher than any job - it calls for personal development as well as skills development.  NEVER ask yourself if you want to keep going once you start.  That question is toxic when things are tough.  Practically the only way to fail a PhD is by not finishing.  Once you get to the final year all academics will assume you are going to get the PhD and treat you like one of them, simply because you've got that far.\n\nUnless you are lucky, start thinking of your free time in 30 min segments.  I abandoned evenings and weekends as free time completely for several years.  If you've got kids, even more so.  But ensure some relaxation time every day (I got 30 min every weeknight, and 1 hour on weekends).  Make sure you have full support from spouse, etc, it will be tough on them too.\n\nBecause of your age, most academic staff will treat you like an equal.   Use it - talk to them, get favours, understand that they think university politics is tough, but compared to politics in any business, it's kids stuff, so work the system.  Grab every free support service the university has, most younger students are too timid or naive to use them.  For example, I found an office which no one was using.  Asked around staff in the department and found out it wasn't allocated to anyone, got the key and had my own private office for a year.  It was never official, and I would never have got permission, but since no one was responsible for the office, there was no one to throw me out.  Having your own workspace, even if just a desk in the library, is very useful.\n\nSecond year will be the toughest.  This is when most withdraw.  This is when you have to start developing the academic professional persona.  Once you learn to think and talk like an academic, everything gets easier.\n\nGet a tablet or similar which you can carry on you at all times.  Get as much of your research material in PDF or ebook format as possible.  That way you can carry around reading all the time, whenever you have a moment.  I completely stopped with paper material and books after my first year, and have about 2,000 PDF's on my tablet, plus Kindle, plus Adobe Digital Editions.\n\nHave a physical relaxation regime - yoga or boxing or walking the dog - doesn't matter what, but you need to shed stress.  When you're deep in the thesis writing, it will be in your head day and night.  You need to ditch that stress through the body somehow.\n\nFINALLY - GO FOR IT.  It's the intellectual equivalent of Mt Everest.  Tough and character-building, wouldn't wish a PhD on my worst enemy, but totally worth it.

The way he works and juggles between being a PhD student, a choir scholar and a youtuber is impressive. His vlogs always make me want to be more productive, and they're just a great watch, really.\n\nI also like to watch other student \"day in the life\" kind of vlogs, especially when they're busy students (i.e. not 2 classes a week). Of course it is still entertainment, but it just puts me in a mood to try and be more productive, like: \"If this person can do it, I can do it too\". There are many study-related channels on Youtube, that generally give tips about productivity and organisation. They're mostly aimed at high school students and undergrad, but they can be applied at any stage of your life, really.\n\nBeing a PhD student is so different from being an undergrad though, where you go to class with the same people, and you have a schedule. It's much more challenging to be on your own, and you have to make your own schedule and stick to it. But it's also important not to freak out and hate yourself when you don't exactly achieve what you wanted to achieve that day.\n\nAlso, the hardest thing about a PhD is to not always know where you're going, or what you have to do. You have to spend way more time actually defining the tasks you have to do. It's so hard to just sit at your desk and know that you have to \"do research about some subject\". It's not precise. It's not a simple goal you can achieve by just putting in the time. So you have to break down this big block in much smaller one, and to try to have as many straightforward tasks as possible. Much easier to get work done when you know exactly what you're supposed to do.\n\nTL;DR: Watch student vlogs, or productivity videos.

Based on your post, there's nothing that you did that I wouldn't have tried to do too.\n\nHowever, moving forward, I suggest writing down very clearly the conversation that you had with him. You did a very good job of that here, but I recommend doing so in even more detail for yourself. Include the exact wording he used. Mention any aspect of the conversation that made you feel like he was discriminating against you (which he obviously did with his comments about being a woman) or bullying you (which he also did). A paper trail is going to be your strongest ally if this issue persists or if you need to describe to someone else the details of this encounter. It may be strong in your memory now, but you will forget details as time goes on.\n\nAlthough you may not want to stir the pot before you even get into the school, I think it's important that you report this to the school administration. It may take some calling around to find out where the appropriate place is, but I'm sure that you will be able to find the right person to speak with. The department chair is an option. The school's admissions office is another option. If they have an ethics office, that may be appropriate as well. \n\nThis is a turning point in the history of universities, where tenured professors are starting to be held accountable for their past and current sexual misconduct. It's essential that you report this soon because this is the time when students are being interviewed and this professor should not be given the opportunity to abuse another poor student in the same situation. This is also important to report soon because if the response of the school administration to your report is unsympathetic, you may want to reconsider whether this school is the one for you. Decades of sexual harassment reports suppressed by university administration led to many graduates burning out of academia and they never got justice. I wouldn't want that to happen to you, so take it as an opportunity to see the culture of this university when it comes to reporting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you can get through to someone who can help and if you ever want to chat, feel free to DM me.

To enter, a postdoc is not essential (and technically neither is a PhD...), but it can certainly work to your advantage if you know why you are doing it and how to play your hand during the job search. If you end up going for a postdoc, my advice would be mindful of the following:\n\n1. Pursue a field where the research focus or the techniques you'll acquire is relevant to where you want to end up in the industry. Eg. the immuno-oncology job market is blowing up (relatively speaking) for basic immunologists/cell biologists.\n2. How much you intend to accomplish during however many years of postdoc, and whether those accomplishments will be competitive enough. It's fine to do a long ass postdoc, but the expectations will also inevitably rise. A 2 year postdoc that gives additional exposure to a few cutting edge assays and project leadership might demonstrate sufficient productivity. Likewise, a 6 year postdoc isn't the end of the world if, say, that's what it took for you land a couple Nature/Science/Cell papers.\n3. If you plan to move abroad (eg. from the US), it'll be kind of hard for (American) companies to fly you back to interview you past the initial phone screen stage, especially since so many of these companies are based in cities filled to the brim with top talent (for US, Boston, NJ, CA Bay Area).

The key detail is that they had already accomplished much, they had advanced degrees or were well placed in their careers, but worried that at any moment they would be caught out as frauds. \n\nI learned about impostor syndrome when I was in grad school but it didn't seem like it applied to me. The \"problem\" with impostor syndrome is the conflict between what you've accomplished and how you feel. You can point to your accomplishments but you still feel a fraud. As a first or second year PhD student, you actually do not have any accomplishments to point to. \n\nIt turns out, that is okay. There's a difference between impostor syndrome and inexperience. As a grad student, you are not an impostor, you are inexperienced. No one will call you a fraud because no one thinks you are an expert. If you don't know something, have a setback or experience failure, or appear a fool, that is also fine, because that is part of being inexperienced. This is how you become experienced. \n\nDo you feel like you could be accomplishing more but something is holding you back? That something might be many things: anxiety and depression, inexperience, poor work habits, a tyrannical supervisor, but is is not impostor syndrome. It might seem like this distinction is meaningless but it helped me. I went from thinking \"oh I just have a general sense that I'll be found as a fraud\" to \"actually, I just need to work really hard and not pay attention to what other people think\" because my problem wasn't impostor syndrome, it was a bad attitude about work.

You get paid \u20ac2200-2800(ish)/month and get a contract for 4 years (more rare; 3 or 5). You become an employee of the university and get all the perks of a job such as generous vacation days, pension plan, 13th month pay and a vacation bonus (effectively a 14th month pay). Your pay is pretty much guaranteed, so no mid-PhD risks of funding falling through. Scholarships are also not really a thing. It is the professor's responsibility to get the funding in order, not yours. Benefit of being an employee over a student.\n\nYou are expected to publish work, and a dissertation in sciences is typically your published or submitted work stapled together with an extra introduction, discussion and possibly chapters with information that you deemed unfit to publish. For those who care; your dissertation will be a formal book, complete with an ISBN code. Exact number of publications varies per field, but around 4 in total is a good guideline (in extremes; I've seen one person defend without publications). You will likely also be expected to teach. Either lecturing in classes and/or tutorials and/or supervising Bachelor- and Master-thesis students with their final thesis project.\n\nGetting a position is also like getting a job. The positions are posted on job boards (for Dutch research jobs especially look at [academictransfer.com](https://academictransfer.com)). You reply, you get invited to an interview and if you are deemed suitable you go for a second round interview. The second round typically involves a presentation of what you did during your Master's thesis presented to the research group. If you pass, you get to start! If you don't, you don't. What is required *exactly* for the specific position varies, but typically they will want a resume, *maybe* a cover letter, some copy of your Master's degree and *maybe* a transcript of your Master's grade.

I have a fairly extensive process: \n\n* For keeping bits and pieces, someone else has suggested that you start a thesis file and keep random bits of experiments, literature under relevant headings. I do this in a program called **Scrivener**. I have had many problems with word and long documents (one document stopped spell checking, nothing worked, had to copy and paste it in unformatted text into a new document and completely re-do multiple tables - it was a nightmare), Scrivener is very very stable. I also keep an annotated bibliography here. At the start this helped me to learn how to be more evaluative of things I had read. I would highly recommend if you don't use scrivener, start the file somewhere as mentioned previously, not having a blank page to start from helps a lot!\n* I use **NVIVO** for my literature review. I use it to 'code' quotes etc to a certain Node and then I have my quotes for that topic all in one spot. Other people use word documents, but I like to have everything in one spot. \n* Use a referencing software. Doesn't matter which one, just use one! I use **Endnote**, and my library backs up to their cloud service.\n* Use cloud storage to backup your work. Don't really on 'I'll back it up on to my external hard drive every 2nd day'. Because the time you get relaxed will be the time your computer crashes and you lose everything. Also, do not just rely on an external hard drive if you choose not to use cloud storage. I had a friend who (for some unknown reason) only stored her PHD work on an external hard drive. The Hard drive broke, she lost it all. Exceptions to cloud storage, don't put your EndNote library on there as I have heard it can corrupt the library. \n* I use **Rescuetime** to track what I am doing, how productive I am\n* I use the **StayFocused** chrome extension to give me a certain amount of time on FB and Twitter, after this it blocks them. \n* I also have a **Postit note wall** above my desk, I put tasks to do on there. I have 'To do' 'In progress' (which only ever has 3 things in it MAX, so I stay focussed) and 'Completed'. I also have a **whiteboard** for scheduling my time.

Also if they seem reticent try to have an agenda when scheduling the meeting. If you explain that you have several things to run through they may be more receptive to spending the time.\n\n  Secondly check if there are any contact time requirements from the university. We are required to have 1 hour every 2 weeks and a full supervisory meeting every three months. If these are not met you fail your end of year assessment.

That being said, I have just finished my first year, and I attend a 1-2 hour long meeting every two months or so. I see my supervisors around and elsewhere, and we email, but that's the time allocated to really sit down and talk.\n\nFirst, you have overcommitted yourself. I have been in your position before and it is simply not worth it. Why? Well, aside from boosting your CV, these extracurriculars will *not* get you your dissertation. You either need to delegate more effectively or drop some of your commitments. You are too early into your journey to burn out. Carve out time just for you, because you need time to write and work without distraction!\n\nSecond, you should contact your GRC/research advisor in your faculty. They will advise on the next best step. It might be you just have a shitty advisor who does this all the time to candidates, in which case it's a pattern of behaviour, and something their colleagues are likely already aware of. But as this is impacting your ability to do your PhD, it needs addressing. They can also advise on avenues to either bring in another supervisor to your team, or to change supervisors entirely. It depends on the administrative structure of your program.\n\nThird, you can always just talk to your advisor. It might be a difficult conversation, but finding five minutes to say, \"I need more support from you; can we please discuss an action plan moving forward?\" will save you a lot of hassle later. Alternately, one good method is to arrange the next meeting at the close of the current one. You can always try suggesting a time the following week, and straight-up asking for an hour. It's ballsy, but it will get you what you want. Follow this up with an email addressing what you will have accomplished prior to the meeting, so your supervisor knows it won't be a \"sit around and talk vaguely about research\" kind of meeting, but one with an agenda. It's critical to set up what you want to discuss and to follow through. Aside from being useful for you, it gets you into good workplace habits, and demonstrates to your supervisor that you're in it for the long haul.\n\nGood luck. Navigating these politics is draining.

I was super immersed in university level political activism and student elections. Literature was a good base but I wanted something more hands on and something that doesn't force me to do an MBA. So I did my master's in social work. While completing the degree, I came to 3 conclusions 1. Social work has its uses but in the Indian context, the major problem is policy and how we go about designing it. 2. After doing the master's research, I found that I like doing research - while I am not too keen about the writing part, I was opening up to the idea of using statistics for analysis. 3. Development sector jobs available to me post masters were crap - I could not bring myself to do those jobs for the rest of my life. Job was crappy so was the pay. \n\nIt would be difficult to learn to apply statistics and learn quant methods if I stayed in India. Plus I doubt any of the good places in India that offers masters in anything relatively close to statistics would be accessible for someone with a Ba and a MA.

Also am bad at networking, so I thought the PhD would not only allow me the scope to learn the things I wanted to but also help me be competitive in the Indian job market. \n\nAm ABD now - while I did a lot of statistics courses and I am in a better position than I was. I also realize that I have not any more confident about the job market. I feel as dumb as I did in first year. Partly because there are many like me in the US and enough people to go around who are better than me at what I do. In the Indian context, the development sector market doesn't need my skill sets. I write this only to point out that do a PhD only if you intend to stay in academia or if you think you have solid networks to facilitate a jump from the university to the industry.

Sometimes, you have no idea or where you are, or what you should do, and you can only get so much help from your supervisor. You have to be really organized, because being in charge of your own schedule can bite you in the ass if you get too complacent. PhDs can be isolating if you don't surround yourself with a social group, you have to find balance between being social and getting work done. You think about your research all the time, it takes practice to just completely switch off, and take time to relax. Doing research is also about being a good writer and a good speaker, so these are skills you need to develop; getting results is not enough, you have to learn how to present them in a way that is honest, but also makes your paper/thesis look good.\n\nThere is much more to it, but yeah, that's it!

I have no regrets and enjoyed it, although it was tough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Don't be surprised with the amount of administrative nonsense that will be put on you. It's probably the first thing that surprised me. It's not that not doing a PhD allows you to avoid that, but more or less the fact that you are transitioning from a degree into work (at least here in europe). For masters internships I was used to being in the lab 90% of the time and writing 10% of the time. In a PhD that lab time is going to decrease a lot.\n\n\\- Nothing is going to work and that's the standard. This is research for you. It's going to be frustrating. Do not put your spiritual satisfaction on getting results. Get it from increasing your knowledge instead. After 3 years of work and a doctorate obtained you are a different person than what you started as, regardless of what kind of results you've gotten.  \n\n\n\\- Really schedule organizing yourself. On top of administrative stuff, your new fearsome responsibility is having all your data worked out, filled in, filed in proper categories and well described. In a masters you may get away with being in a lab and running a few analyses and then getting back in the lab before putting everything together. That won't fly here. Please have a consistent system for organizing yourself from day 1 and stick to it. For example, name your downloaded articles with a certain code (e.g. Name et al, year, journal). Also, please use software to make everything easier (EndNote/Zotero to name a few).  \n\n\n\\- Literature has been expanded to being 'reading a few papers to understand what you are doing' to 'having to know everything and anything about the field. That's daunting, so please schedule days that you catch up on literature. Annoying, but it teaches you to read articles properly and efficiently.   \n\n\n\\- I know your contract says 40 h but you can forget about it. Just work till the work is done. That will probably be closer to an average of 50 h a week, but especially in the last half year it's going to be crazy (was 70 h a week for me). Be prepared for that. It means you have to balance your social life and relaxation with work even better.   \n\n\n\\- Your mental state is probably most dependant on your advisor. Please make sure they are the right one and know what they are doing. Communicating with them is a two way learning process. They have to get used to you as you get used to them. You need to know how to communicate with them the best way. Please don't take everything they say personal. If they seem angry, reassure yourself that at the very least they are concerned about your project and care about you finishing it. If they are absent or don't give enough input, be more forward and demanding.

In Mendeley I found myself dragging the same paper to multiple folders, where each folder was a topic or sub topic. In Evernote, I just tag a paper with all relevant areas and some special tags like \"ToRead\" \"&lt;Year&gt;\" etc. Then when I need to reference back to papers I can just search by tags, and instantly find those related ones. I never worry about forgetting to a put a paper in the right folder.\n2. From everything I've tried, Evernote's pdf markup is quite good. It's not 100% perfect (sometimes I have to re-tap once or twice) but I feel its 90% there. I do pay for the premium service ($10 a month) and I'm not sure if its required for these features).

I know others have done it, and I\u2019m sure it can be done; however, I think it should be done only in certain circumstances. Also, this advice should be taken with a grain of salt that I don\u2019t know you, your story, or anything about you other than your age. Talking from my own point of view though, I thought about going straight into PhD after undergrad and am so so glad I didn\u2019t. I once heard that advice is a form of nostalgia, and all this is just my own viewpoints on my life. I worked for four years instead of going straight PhD, and it was a great decision and here\u2019s why:\n\n1) I was incredibly immature at 23, emotionally, mentally, etc. High school and undergrad, no matter your experiences, is nothing like real life to be frank. Even if you are working full-time and come from very difficult background, it is still nothing like holding down a \u201ccareer\u201d type job and trying to make it in a career. You grow so much as a person those first few years out of undergrad, and you just don\u2019t get that same experience in a PhD. As far as the young people in my program goes, honestly it shows. They are immature and seem to struggle with a lot of stuff that they would\u2019ve learned working full-time had they not gone straight to PhD. (I am sorry if this comes off as talking down to a young person, I certainly don\u2019t want to do that! I am just trying to say I think back to my own self and am glad I am not working through things like budget managing, work-life balance, office politics, etc. for the first time while trying to get a degree).\n\n2) You will be missing out on some of the best years of your life, which is working right after undergrad with your first real money coming in. PhD\u2019s are a full-bore machine gun of stressors, responsibilities, and difficulties, and honestly is nothing like a \u201ccareer\u201d type job. You will not be able to have much fun or be social. Your early twenties will likely be the time of your life where you have the fewest responsibilities, highest income to expenses, best opportunities to travel/explore and to find yourself. I changed so much in those years working and I am such a better person for it. I faced and beat so many life challenges while working that has helped me handle the stress of PhD immensely. Also, I am glad my first 9-5 job won\u2019t be as a professor.\n\n3) I don\u2019t know about Psychology but my research is way better thanks to my working time. I know a lot more about the industry side of my field, which has really helped for my dissertation and research.\n\n4) It\u2019s so cool you\u2019re set on a PhD, but you haven\u2019t really experienced what is out there for your degree. I went through three different jobs I didn\u2019t like but I learned a lot from that work and it helped me appreciate the PhD a lot more. My cohort mates who didn\u2019t work seem to question their decisions way more than I do, and I think its partly because they didn\u2019t ever experience anything else other than school.\n\nAgain, I know most people here are saying to go for it, and you certainly won\u2019t ruin your life or anything by doing that. I also don\u2019t know any about you other than this post, but my years working after undergrad were so important to who I am and have helped me so much as a person. The PhD will always be there but you won\u2019t get your early 20\u2019s back. Also, don\u2019t worry so much about \u201cnot being able to do anything with a psych major\u201d. People find good work with all sorts of degrees, and you don\u2019t need to be making a billion buckos a year to have a livable salary/life. Try random jobs that seem interesting. Maybe you could work on a research team in a big city. Yes the work will be grunt work. Yes it will not pay well. Yes it won\u2019t be as satisfying as whatever you could do with a PhD. But you are young and likely have minimal expenses and so much opportunity for fun. If it were me again, I\u2019d say: move to a big city, find a job somewhat related to your field, have the time of your life, then head back and get that Pile of Honorary Dogshit. \n\nAll that being said, if you do decide to go to PhD and get in somewhere, congrats! I am sure you will do great!

She honestly sounds like she treats you horribly (speaking to you as if you were stupid, laughing at you etc). If it was me I wouldn't consider continuing working under someone like that. Is there any way you could change advisor?\n\n- You mention that you find it hard to self-teach new concepts. In my opinion that's a big, big part of PhD. You need to consider carefully about why you find it hard and if this is something you can overcome or not. The ability to work independently and self teach seem key to completely a PhD to me. \n\n- Your difficulty reading papers and your ADHD diagnosis. I'm not sure how many papers you had to read for the exam (I'm guessing 5 X say 4 committee members but correct me if I'm wrong). But reading say a paper every day for a month (20 papers) is quite manageable for most people. I think you need to pinpoint why you're getting stuck on this (and being unproductive in general) and decide if this is something you can overcome in the next few months. With the ADHD diagnosis, you might need to accept that before you can do a PhD you need to work on strategies/medication to cope with your symptoms and get these in place before you can continue. \n\nIs there a graduate advisor type person you can discuss this with? A more senior member of the department who is outside of your research?
