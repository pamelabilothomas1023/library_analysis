You will still have options - unless someone is waiting for you and can't wait. But even then, so what?

That been said, personally if you're  thinking  a PhD is not for you this is a totally valid feeling and choice. I think intelligent people feel that being in the highest level of scholar research is the only way to being intelligent... And it's simple not truth. Intellectual happiness and emocional happiness are often in the same direction and sometimes they are not.  So... My long advice is, plan your way out. Don't just jump out of the program and figure out things later. Plan where do you want to go, what kind of jobs you are going to look for. It's a 9-5? Try a part time job before you leave the program, to figure out if the structure is want you are missing - I get the feeling, sometimes I just want a job that ends in the end of the day and don't follow me home all the f time - this the only life you getting so do things that make you happy. Work meant to be the thing we do to get money to pay for the things we need -and sometimes want - but it doesn't need to be your whole life.

You're supposed to learn the things you need to know to be an expert, that takes time. \n\nAlways remember that you're good enough. If you weren't, you wouldn't have been accepted. \n\nYou should consider therapy. It sounds like you're having some anxiety, which is okay, but it will make the process so much harder for no reason. I think this also goes along with learning how to make mistakes, mistakes seem so much worse if there is anxiety loaded into it too. Glassware breaks sometimes, new ones can be bought. \n\nA lot of the mistakes made  in my group is costly. I work in crop science. So when we mess up, its a big dent on a truck, a tractor that no longer runs, etc. My boss always says \"as long as everyone is alright, it's okay. Things can be replaced, people can not.\" Which I think its a good view to have. Of course you should try to be as safe as possible and avoid making mistakes, but odds are you're going to drop another piece of glassware one day. It happens. \n\nAcademic failure is also something you'll have to learn to cope with. You won't always win poster contests. You'll have papers get rejected. You'll be rejected from grants. You'll be giving a talk and you'll mess up. I'll throw myself under the bus for you. I usually do well giving talks, it's not something I personally struggle with. In November I was at a conference and on the morning of one of my talks I woke up with so much anxiety, just randomly. I was prepared. I know the work like the back of my hand and I could talk for hours about it. But that day? My 15 minute talk lasted about 4 minutes. I was so nervous I rushed straight through it, jumbled things around, and overall made no sense. It was incredibly embarrassing. These  things happen, and its okay. Failing means that you at least tried, and trying is worth something. \n\nAnother note on mistakes. Assuming your PI is a kind person, always let him know when you mess up. It is so much easier to fix a mistake if you tell someone sooner rather than later. Plus, keeping him informed on these things will probably strengthen your relationship. He will have the peace of mind knowing that if you mess something up, you'll ask for help instead of trying to hide it and letting it snowball. \n\nMost importantly, trust your gut. Grad school isn't for everyone, it has a high dropout rate for a reason. I think you should give it a try. But remember that quitting is always an option. If grad school just isn't for you, it is okay to leave. Or, if your lab and PI are a bad fit for you it is also okay to try a new lab with a new PI. Quitting does not equal failure. \n\nBest of luck to you OP! \n\n(Also, sorry that this is really rambley.

It is easier to make these jumps when working for smaller employers than big tech giants which can afford to hire specific experts even for niche sub fields. That said, the good thing about broad positions like technical writer in this instance, is that it is actually insane how much you get to learn and how many new things you'd become familiar with compared to a researcher researching a specific topic.

In the grand scheme of things, I have graduated with a PhD in a reasonably high demand field of study, published some papers, and gained the research experience that I needed to compete for research and industry positions. However, I slightly regret not trying harder (or sooner) to get a PhD position at my alma mater after I finished my degree there, which is a much more prestigious uni than the one I got my PhD at.

Perhaps you would be worse off there. There is no right or wrong answer in this situation. I think you ended up exactly where you needed to be, but I could be mistaken.

However, I will be joining a lab that works with *in-vivo* and cell-based models of metal-dependent gene regulation as a postdoc in July. \n\nThe only thing I knew before I started in a lab was that this lab used a technique I was very familiar with from my undergraduate research. That was it. No known projects or anything. Just a foundation from which to grow. \n\nNow, what does that say, exactly? For me, I am moving from one aspect of science to a vastly different area that only has some mild overlap. However, this provides a broad skillset for me to build my future academic career from. From both my PhD and postdoc, I suspect I will be able to approach many problems, in whatever related field I am interested in.\n\nSo, overall, do what you find interesting and pursue that relentlessly. As you go through a PhD many of these things may become more solidified as you gain experience and start to get a deeper understand of both the field and yourself.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/tw9hkw/phd_lab_vs_future_career_field/i3e8f1b/"}, "681": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "haunted_waffles", "Date": 1649102631, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you!

Some tips:\n\n1)Work smart, not (necessarily) hard. Do your work but do not overdo it. Take breaks (weekends are super important!!!)\n\n2)Have a social circle, preferably 1-2 good close friends. Friends are important in allowing you to relax, have fun and also be able to talk about how you feel with someone you trust. Also, it will allow you to vent your frustrations which there will be plenty in your PhD\n\n3)Accept failure. A lot of people are super-achievers before doing a PhD. Good grades, top awards, etc. A PhD will therefore be quie frustrating, especially for experimental fields. There will be a lot of failure, A lot. Make sure to not take it personally and learn from it\n\n4) Exercise. Physical activity can take your mind off a difficult day. It keeps you mentaly sharp and physically fit. Do it!\n\n5) Communication with your PI is key. Express how you feel and think, especially when something is not right. Set weekly, bi-weekly meetings and talk through your progress and where youare struggling. If your PI is a big-shot and not in the lab, do this with a post-doc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!

We could use a little less of that.\n\nThe PhDs who thrive repackage themselves to seem shiny to tech's weird flavor of elitism. They tend to do beautifully. Frustration tolerance, critical thinking, record keeping, and methodical progress are very hard skills to refine. Learning to code enough to get paid can be done in 12 week boot camps.  \n\nMuch of the transition is becoming comfortable claiming expertise, and letting go of the academic 'be the very best' measure of success. Things move so fast in tech that 'done' is nearly always more rewarded than 'good.' there's almost no value on craftsmanship beyond 'adequate.' The best engineer for the job is often whoever is there and game at the right time. That's what 'best' means in this circumstance. Best in the field is almost impossible to measure, anyway. I worked in downtown SF and NYC for years and I'm sure I've never heard of the best engineer. They probably don't talk about it and are known on the web for their niche podcast that has nothing to do with coding. \n\nBottom line, the Internet is put together with matchsticks and chewing gum. It's a miracle that it works, but the internet IS a miracle. Being part of it and great at what you do looks very different than being a good scholar. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that you think you're going to suck, but I think it's possible that what makes you a mediocre academic could make you a stellar technologist. The incentives are entirely different. It's why I left. It made me very unhappy. \n\nI strongly encourage you to read Presence, by Amy Cuddy. It talks about dealing with imposter syndrome and was game changing for me. \n\nThe advice I give everyone who goes into tech is 'take the money and run.' Don't make it your life. It's a cold plastic world without a scrap of aesthetic appreciation and whimsy is as rare as hen's teeth.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/tvxx4c/im_going_to_be_30_years_old_and_looking_for_entry/i3eu8c5/"}, "721": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BellaMentalNecrotica", "Date": 1649110842, "Score": 1, "Body": "lolwat.

It really depends upon what you want out of the PhD, both in the short and long term. Also, it really depends on what the topic is and what else you use the time for. I can only go from my own experiences, so I'll describe that.\n\nI always loved school, I enjoyed learning, and also studied subjects that I was interested in (pretty much an equal split between sciences and humanities). At undergraduate I studied Psychology, which is kind of comical in hindsight as it's alot of biochemistry but in the brain and I haven't got qualifications in either biology or chemistry (only physics and maths in the sciences haha!).\n\nAfter that I worked in an accounting office for a year, did surveys door to door (the job was sold to me social research methods and face to face interviewing \ud83d\ude02) and then private tutoring. I did each of these for a year, and started to really reflect on what I wanted to do with my life. A job felt too stagnant, where you could watch each year pass into the next. I decided that, after growing up on a farm and seeing business first hand, I wanted to go into business (after much hesitation, business can be a bit like game of thrones, you either win or you loose alot fast haha!).\n\nAt the time, my sister suggested setting up a glamping business in our farm (I'd always wanted to put a little log cabin up the back field haha!). So, I decided if I was going to go into business, I wanted to do it properly, and applied for a MSc in business strategy and entrepreneurship (a good description would be a post grad in creative business strategies for start ups, so perfect for my needs). After hardcore working my fingers to the bone, whilst setting up the glamping business (sourcing suppliers, finance options, going to business workshops) I managed to graduated first in my year!\n\nMy supervisor suggested I apply for funding for a PhD, as there was a project that seemed perfect for me (an interesting mixture of psychology, busines and marketing). I initially brushed it off, but the offer came back around, and I rushed an application and managed to get the funding. One catch though, I had to do 2nd MSc in social research methods as a requirement for the funding. So during the second masters I kept starting the business, building the mains infastructure upto the site (water, electric, sewage) as well as pretty much terraforming the site. Sooooo much top soil, stone chippings and raw materials moved by shovel and wheelbarrow haha!\n\nAfter starting the PhD properly, I decided that I needed to make some serious life changes. Just before applying for my undergraduate degree, my father passed away from cancer and it was something I never really processed (I just went down an abusive lifestyle, partying too much on my own and burning the candle at 3 ends). So, I decided to start seeing a councilor to help with my sobriety about half way through the 2nd masters (this helped to deal with the bereavement, but didn't really keep me sober so much). About 3 months into the PhDs first year, I realised I couldn't keep going, otherwise I'd severally mess one thing up as I was juggling too many plates, so I joined a sobriety group and started going to meetings (I've been sober for almost 1 and a half years now).\n\nAt about mid-2020, we opened the business, after many steps forward and many steps back. During that time I came to terms with my autism, got assessed, and it turns out I am indeed autistic (kinda explained alot, including the encyclopedia level memory I have but serious issues with socialising). Since opening, we've had 50+ groups use the cabin, and plan for another one in around 2 years time. I fell in love with my PhD again, after going through some rough patches, and have even done some teaching. In the future, I plan on straddling the two camps of academia with part time lecturing because I love it and busines by growing the glamping site and consulting with other businesses (Ive already started with a couple local ones during the PhD).\n\nThe reason why I state all of this is quite simple. I knew that my life was becoming untenable, and that If I didn't decide to dedicate myself Id end up in the sad boat that my dad ended up in in terms of addiction. So for me, the PhD offered a framework to grow, both emotionally and psychologically. I know it'll be different for everybody, which is why I said it at the beginning. But you really have to ask yourself what you want out of the PhD and what else you can do with yourself during. \n\nIf I'd kept on my abusive course, I'd still be miserable, despite having a Dr before my name. The busines probably would have become half arsed and family frictions would have arose. Ask yourself what you can truly get out of a PhD other than the title, and then consider whether it's worth the 4 years. In that time I've gotten sober, started and launched a business, accepted my autism and orientation (that was one I left out, it's been a whirl wind haha!) and started to become a fully formed human \ud83d\ude02.\n\nA PhD is hefty endeavour, I was naive when I started it thinking it'd be easy, but it offers potential to grow you as a person, and at the end of the day those 4 years reflects a fraction of your lifespan. But it could offer a platform for a great quality of life, depending upon what you want to use it for! Sorry for the ramble, but I firmly believe you real what you sow with a PhD, so the times not wasted, it's just invested \ud83d\ude42\n\nAlso, sorry for the poor quality writing, it's late and I'm on my phone \ud83d\ude02", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ja5i5y/do_you_feel_like_you_traded_away_part_of_your/i3fnmt0/"}, "759": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "cienfuegos__", "Date": 1649122893, "Score": 2, "Body": "Oh I'm so glad to hear that, and yet sorry to hear you don't have many great examples of positive life for us ladies over 30.

Our kid was born a month after I started my PhD. \n\nHonestly it's been a real struggle (wife is the main earner (geneticist in industry) and earns more than any other scientist I know due to her skill set). We live however 8 hours away from the nearest family have had no support network. Having the little one has really changed my outlook on life, previous I was extremely career driven, however I went part-time last November so she could return to work after maternity. Never did I realise how much I love spending the extra 2 days a week with the kiddo. \n\nEven during the first year of PhD with a newborn I was maintaining a strict 'its a job schedule' 9-5, mon-fri. Which was working but since going part-time I honestly couldn't care about my PhD any longer. My life view has really changed and all I can think is if I went back to work we could afford a house nearer family and have far less in my life (demanding industry funded PhD)\n\nI guess what I'm saying is you have to decide what best for not just you but also your family and life.

Make sure you have enough financial support\n\n2. Make sure you have enough childcare support\n\nA PhD + TA is a full-time job that pays hardly anything. So you'll need full-time childcare if you don't have it already, and then extra money to pay for that full-time childcare. If you don't have both those things, it is going to be very hard to finish. It sounds like you've got the financial part sorted out, but don't discount how much full-time childcare costs if you're not paying for it now. In my high cost of living area, we were paying $2,000 a month for a one year old in daycare, and with two kids of daycare age you could be looking at almost  $4,000 a month. Hopefully childcare where you are is cheaper but it can still be pricey.\n\nAlso, don't expect to have the \"PhD experience\". You probably aren't going to be going out for drinks with your labmates at 4:30. You weren't going to get to join any extracurricular activities. You'll probably have to miss some big events, like your friend's thesis defense, because of kid stuff conflicting. You'll have to choose between taking that class you want and seeing your kids, because the class will be taught from 6-8pm. It does depend somewhat on the school and the department, but by and large grad schools are designed around people who don't have kids. \n\nBut if you think a PhD is helping to be really great for your career, and you have the resources above, then it *might* work out. However, it's still probably going to be the most miserable and difficult thing you've ever done.\n\nOne last piece of advice is that if there's any way to do a master's before the PhD, do it. That way at least you have a degree to show for it if you decide to leave after a few years.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/twgylv/got_accepted_into_a_phd_program_at_32_yo_i_have_a/i3h55cl/"}, "847": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "MergerMe", "Date": 1649157335, "Score": 2, "Body": "If I were you, besides being extremely pissed right now, I'd start looking for scholarships to do research abroad.

I hope your supervisor might have kids themselves or at least understand that as long as the work gets done, it doesn't really matter if you do it 9-5.

It sounds a lot like what I went through, so if it helps you at all here is a little bit about my experience.\n\nI started my masters in biochem at a smaller Canadian university. After a year or so I filled out the paperwork and transferred into the PhD program. My gf and I had been talking about kids and I discussed things with my PI. He said no time is perfect and to go for it, so I did. I was 29 when my oldest was born and I took three weeks off from lab work. She had her maternity leave + the parental leave from the gov't so she was off work for a year. Then two years later we had our daughter, except by now I managed to snag a scholarship with parental leave. So I took a full semester off and just hung out at home with my gf and kids. It was awesome. Now my kids are turning 5 and 3 this summer and I'm in the process of writing my final paper and thesis, planning to defend around the end of summer. \n\nHere are some of my thoughts about the whole process. The main thing I can say is that it will be really, really hard. You won't be in the lab as much as anyone else, and you won't be home as much as you'd like. It basically feels like you're spread too thin, constantly. Also, nights/sleeping can be brutal. There is tons of work to do in terms of data processing, writing, planning, etc. and you very likely won't be sleeping well because of the kid(s). That can change dramatically and some people are very lucky to have easy sleepers but ours were not (and the younger one still isn't). You're going to be tired for a long time, and often you'll have to hear people 10 years younger than you complain that they didn't sleep so well the night before. So you just have to grin and bear it lol.\n\nFinancially, you'll want to cry a lot unless you have outside help or your partner has a salary. I had a respectable scholarship from the federal gov't and still we are constantly broke. Thankfully, most things that babies need are quite cheap. A lot of stuff is just marketed to make people spend money when in reality, you don't need most of it. I can go into more details on that if ever you're interested. But still there are expenses that can't be avoided.\n\nBetween the lack of sleep and money, the huge work load and the crying, your mental health can take a hit. Double check beforehand that you're in a good place, but even then, childbirth can bring on post-partem depression unexpectedly and that can result in even more stress/responsibility on your part. So I'd suggest making sure you have a support network beforehand, just in case.\n\nThen, if you want a post-doc, you'll likely have to consider moving around with your partner and kids. Depending their age, this could be easier or harder. \n\nFinally, a big reason I was able to do this was because of some location-based advantages. Childcare here in Quebec is very cheap (8$/day), my PI is very understanding and encourages the importance of family, and we have pretty good parental leave programs. I don't think I would have done this if I couldn't have taken time off or if my partner couldn't have had so much time off. Overall I'm very glad to have done things this way!

Family every time. A PhD is, most of the time, not intellectually stimulating. It is an exercise in bloody-mindedness and singular focus to keep doing repetitive things in order to finish. As someone below said, most of it is banging your head agains the wall.\n\nBut, it's not a binary choice - you can do a PhD AND have a family. BUT - I would not recommend it!\n\nI started my PhD the same as age as you (33). At the time my wife and I were going through fertility issues as she had recently had an operation to remove an ovary due to a borderline tumour. We had been trying for a baby for two years and were just about to start the IVF journey (which for many couple is a very LONG, EXPENSIVE and tortuous journey).\n\nMy thinking is, like you, I needed to do \"something that is interesting and and intellectually stimulating\" - I was a secondary school teacher before. I really wanted a \"project\" that was going to be all-consuming, something would distract me from the fertility conversations that we kept having - and a long-term project that I could focus on.\n\nWell... two things happened. (1) - I managed to get on a epidemiology PhD program at a great unviersity. and (2) my partner conceived our wonderful son first try on IVF. I was totally over the moon. As soon as that happened - my PhD turned into hell. The one benefit is that due to the pandemic I've been able to work from home... I've had lots of time with my son which I have loved. However there are many negatives: the work culture of academia was a massive culture shock, it's extremely slow and hierarchical, and most of all, most painful of all - I am broke. So broke. My other friends are able to go out for dinner, hire babysitters, and do normal 30-something fun things. My wife and I stay home every day and count pennies. 9 months ago I had the amazing and totally miraculous news that we managed to conceive naturally. I was over the moon. (she is due to give birth to our second next week). Financially it is an absolute DISASTER. I have just taken out a \u00a310000 loan to try and cover my wife's lost earnings while she is on maternity leave...\n\nI haven't even mentioned how awful my primary supervisor is - but the point I want to get across is having a family and doing a PhD is hard, it is often boring, and you will be POOR. By the time you are 30, you have got used to a certain lifestyle. You will throw it all away to do a PhD. Worse, if you have a family, they will have to join you! So lot's to think about. If you have a dream of being an academic and nothing else will do, go for it! Myself, I have managed to get a job being a clinical trials statistician, something I've always wanted to do, and the PhD has unlocked that. I just need to write up 100,000 words in 5 months before I completely run out of money. The opportunity cost of doing a PhD is huge, and I have \u00a310,000s of lost earnings. So think carefully, make sure you get on with your potential supervisor (listen to your gut for any 'red flags' - i didn't and know I am stuck with them) and good luck with starting a family!

We were in Wisconsin, but from California, so we had to plan the wedding from afar. We built a private wedding wiki to organize things (the days before trello etc), and made our invitations. It took a lot of evenings and some weekends, too. We bought fabric in downtown L.A. during the holidays and found a dressmaker, hired a jeweler, and arranged for musicians - a quartet and a DJ. I secretly got Star Trek music for the quartet. My parents cleaned out their big metal shed and arranged the rentals and food for us to get married on their lawn. It was a TON of work. It took all year, off and on, but it all came together nicely. We created our own theme, style, and ceremony. Most everything was made rather than bought, including the cake, made by my sister. We got a lot of advice from Offbeat Brides and Fire your Wedding Planner.\n\nI also invited my advisor, knowing full well he wouldn't fly to California during the field season. Yeah, so that's where there was a little issue. I was in a maize lab, and the wedding was in July. In Maize labs, there is this month-long task of field pollinations - thousands of plants that need to be bagged, pollinated with controlled crosses, and tagged from July-August. Every. Day. Every. One. (Except the undergrad student hourly workers who couldn't be forced to work 7 days a week.) The pollination was so voluminous and harsh that everyone grumbled if you were 10 minutes late, or had something you needed to go to. I was leaving for almost 2 weeks to get married and some were not happy about it. However, my advisor was fine, and said it was an important time for us. Knowing this all beforehand, we planned a \"mini-moon\" instead of a long honeymoon, drove along the coast and it was great. I got back to Wisconsin to get to work again, and everyone eventually forgot.

Perhaps, try filling up the rest of your time at work with learning new skills, ideas, concepts -- not necessarily related to your dissertation topic. Something that you will enjoy doing and yet is somehow related to your larger area of study.\n2. Do not work over the weekend.

After 2 days of complete rest (read: no work related to PhD), you will go to work feeling refreshed.\n3. Do not bring work to home. Do not work in the evenings. Engage in some light activities, sports, entertainment etc.\n4. Do not beat yourself up for unproductive days. This is again quite normal. There will be days, even weeks, months where you will feel super unproductive. Do not let this make you feel despondent. Keep starting over. You are training resilience by doing this. Long term average trends are worth paying attention to, not local fluctuations.  Bring discipline to your life to keep up your daily routines.\n5. Get proper sleep. Cannot emphasise this enough.\n6.

Everyone feels that way. It's just impossible to read whole day and comprehend what you are even reading at the beginning. It gets way better when you have other tasks to do besides reading. Maybe you could give us a hint what your field is? In lab based research I would ask others if you could look over their shoulders when they do experiments. If they are chatty you could always ask them what their topic is and what they are currently investigating / having problems with. If your positions involves teaching / supervising practical courses or something like that you might consider asking for established materials and looking up some stuff. If your lab uses special software to analyze data get yourself familiar with that. Ask for databases or other sources of information and look stuff up to get to know them. If you use a lot of advanced statistics / coding / mathematical jam-jam you might ask someone if you could have their data of a past project for analyzing and see if you come up with the same results.

That's why. I don't find any issue with posing questions to the Reddit community for feedback, but if there is an SO in the picture here, it's disturbing that the post doesn't mention them or their needs or career plans. \n\nIf OP doesn't have an SO, it's obvious they are unsure of what they want out of life, and are posing a hypothetical. In that hypothetical scenario, there is still a troubling lack of thinking about the other person who would be involved in such a significant decision that would impact both partners. This other person will presumably be a woman, who may or may not have her own goals for family or career. If OP chooses to go to grad school *and then* meets someone who wants a family, who will take on childcare? Statistically, it will be the woman who is forced to give up her career, not OP. \n\nI also strongly dislike the underlying implication that OP can simply find a person to have a family with just as easily as they would apply to a Ph.D. program. If OP is single, it should be a very obvious answer - go to grad school and stop presuming you'll meet the right person so quickly. This gives me the feeling that they'd hastily be choosing a partner not based on any compatibility, but based on \"You give me baby? Y/N\", which is how some people go about it, I suppose, but is a great recipe for a dysfunctional relationship and less than ideal parenting. This is especially troublesome given that there is no real implication that OP has considered how a partners life goals might interfere or contradict their own. There's just some hypothetical woman out there ready to pop one out for OP if he decides to not go to grad school. \n\nWhether OP is single or has an SO, it's just a huge oversimplification of two very big life decisions that should be made with nuance and in constant communication with a partner.

A few things that come to my mind while reading what you posted:\n\n\\- Research experience is very important for PhD applications for several reasons. Usually, the more research experience you can get, the better. \n\n\\- I wouldn't count too much on doing the PhD at the same university where you did your masters. That can happen, of course, but don't focus on that. Business PhD applicants often apply to about 15 universities on average, and it seems that number increased after the pandemic. We need to be very open to many opportunities. I don't see many students who do a PhD at the same university they did a masters (and, to be honest, the cases I saw were not really good ones).\n\n\\- Heavy, theoretical, rigorous mathematical coursework is usually considered a very good thing if you are going to do research that is more quantitatively oriented. PhD students not being able to handle that is often a concern for schools, and a reason for a number of students being forced to leave the program. The applied side is less of a concern. \n\n\\- Connecting with professors is really important.

Data reigns supreme.\n***\nI\u2019ve had a couple of wild experiences (including getting kicked out of the university, then reinstated after an independent review of my work found that D and F grades should have been As (all over a .5 unit course). I was well aware of that. I tried to work with the professor in a very respectful manner, including respectfully asserting myself at the end after being accused of self-plagiarism as a defensive maneuver. I\u2019ll tell the full story on here sometime.\n\nBut yes, despite that, I really wouldn\u2019t characterize it so bad, despite the strife and challenges. I do this because it matters to me.\n\nI hate to criticize where this post comes from. I actually have felt inspired to bring positivity to this subreddit as well, as I do see that the tone is depressive here. I haven\u2019t gotten around to it just yet, but it\u2019s been brewing! But, I respectively add that framing this post in this manner actually continues this culture in some ways, as this topic was offered in a contrary way and opens the door to becoming a venting space against some of the things that have been shared here in vulnerability.\n\nMy goal would be to offer a reflection space for our peers in the Ph.D. world that connects with their joy, in such a way that it opens the conversation for positive reflection, without tacitly criticizing or calling into question the real need for people to find other kinds of spaces to vent, which as you have noted, seems to be a dominant trend here of late.\n\nMy suggestion for people who are interested in bringing more positivity to this subreddit is entering an appreciative position. A question could be: \u201cWhat have been the most fulfilling aspects of pursuing your Ph.D.?\u201d Or, \u201cHow has pursuing your Ph.D. provided you with insight or renewed your passion?\u201d \u201cWhere do you see yourself in 5 years, after having completed your research dissertation?\u201d \u201cWhat are three ways that pursuing your Ph.D. has changed your life for the better?\u201d There are myriad ways to open the space toward appreciative inquiry and positive metacognitive reflection.\n\nI appreciate where you are coming from, and as I\u2019ve noted, despite my struggles, I love that I am doing this work. Maybe it is the Organizational Leadership Ph.D. that has me focused on how to bring about a dialog and change by approaching things appreciatively, rather than diagnosing the problem (which is inherently alienating, rather than inclusive).\n\nThank you for the topic. I hear you. I\u2019ve also heard the folks who are struggling. Being a member of this feed has felt depressive at times, I agree.

This is an exploitative relationship that has some limited benefits for you, but ultimately you\u2019re probably working above and beyond the scope of your pay and job description. You\u2019re probably on a handful of publications and run your own projects, which is great, and sets you up nicely to be successful in grad school! \n\nNow for some harsh reality: This is your JOB, not your future. You get paid to run the assays, and to keep the lab going. You aren\u2019t getting paid to conceptualize projects and define overarching goals. You can sleep soundly at night knowing that isn\u2019t (currently) your responsibility. Maybe your PI is promising you\u2019ll continue this work in grad school. Guess what? They\u2019ve failed to recruit you as a grad student and this post is evidence of it. You need to find a different lab for your PhD, or you\u2019ll be expected to continue your role as \u201ctechnician\u201d here in addition to all of your new responsibilities. Find a PI who is excited to mentor you.\n\nNow the tough one to swallow: your work is important, your work is meaningful to society, BUT as soon as you step foot on campus as a PhD student, all of your work, all of your publications you put out as a technician are no longer considered a measure of personal success. You are back to zero. The same thing happens when you start a post doc, and again as a PI. People only  care what you\u2019ve published at your current level of independence. Don\u2019t kill yourself over this work that you are currently struggling with. Your PI is relying on your personal drive to do well, and at the same time they know that NONE of this work is tethered to your future, so if you fail oh well, if you succeed, they reap most of the benefit. It\u2019s not fair to you.\n\nAnother tough pill to swallow: By the end of your PhD, you should expect the level of independence you have now with your PI. Their goal is to train a colleague. It\u2019s fair to expect help now as a tech, and it\u2019s fair to expect as a new grad student, but You shouldn\u2019t expect them to hold your hand through an analysis as a senior grad student. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the day I sent a draft of a paper to my PI as a 5th year grad student and he asked me if it was \u201cpublication quality\u201d and I said yes of course! \u2026and then he said \u201cokay Great I\u2019m going to go submit it then\u201d and my heart jumped into my throat \u201cwait you\u2019re not going to read it?\u201d \n\u201cNope. I trained you. I trust you when you say it\u2019s publication quality. What you send me from here on out should be ready to go out the door. Still think what you sent me is ready?\u201d \u201c\u2026.No\u201d. It was then and there that I realized I was using my PI as a crutch, a safety net to catch all of my errors or flaws in logic. It forced me to think critically twice as hard and to scrutinize my work 4x as hard knowing my PI wasn\u2019t going to be mopping up behind me. I can\u2019t thank him enough for that lesson.\n\nPersonal anecdote time:\n\nI was a technician for 4 years at Harvard. I don\u2019t hold any illusions about being \u201cHarvard educated\u201d or whatever, because I was literally just an employee, and by some grace I was hired to do a job I had no qualifications for, which I think opened me up to exploitation. \n\nI started in my lab as an undergrad part time and moved to a tech position after graduating. I worked like a phd student. I clocked out after 40 hours each week and continued running assays and culturing cells through the weekend. My PI pitched it to me as \u201csolidifying my future in research\u201d and I listened. \n\nI worked my butt off, 50+ hour weeks and only getting paid for 40. I wrote papers at night on my own personal time, I designed assays, I came up with new ideas. By the time I left, I was an author on 10 publications, including a first authorship on one primary and one review. In many graduate schools I had already fulfilled the publication requirements for a PhD. My PI also offered me a free spot in his lab as a phd student, even though I probably had no business getting into Harvard\u2019s grad school. I\u2019m glad I went the route I did. \n\nI got into my PhD program, and soon after I started writing fellowship applications. Many include the line \u201cHow many publications have you had since starting graduate school?\u201d This was where I realized I was back to zero. I thought I\u2019d be a shoo-in for any fellowships with my history, and I was wrong. My new PI was also not shy about telling me that \u201cNo one really gives a shit what you did as a tech, and when you leave here, no one will give a shit what you did as a grad student, they only care about what you produce at your current level\u201d and that\u2019s largely held true. \n\nNow, for some contrast. I worked alongside a brilliant technician who had a stellar undergraduate pedigree, with goals toward a PhD. She patently REFUSED to do any work beyond her scope as a technician. She was a \u201c9-5er\u201d as they were called, and some of the \u201clifers\u201d stigmatized. Guess what? She\u2019s got nearly just as many publications as I do, she went on to get a phd and now holds a prestigious industry post doc position that I would kill for. Her career made me realize that I was exploited as a technician. I was led to believe that goin g above and beyond was in my best interest, and I received only marginal returns.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ty5yp3/pi_doesnt_give_me_time/i3rj8bc/"}, "1448": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "alwayslost999", "Date": 1649340399, "Score": 1, "Body": "Okay that makes sense.

You'd be surprised how willing (with the right therapist) you can be to start talking about simple things and meander down a thought trail to what's really bothering you. A good therapist will help guide the conversation there, too. \n\nA recommendation that I have personally done outside of therapy is setting boundaries with myself to set aside a chunk of time to let everything that's bothering me pour out. For example, you can set a timer for 20 mins and just write down all of your negative thoughts or complaints about the day but only allow yourself that chunk of time to lament.

They make offers to anyone who has a strong proposal rather than everyone who has funding. So in my department for example the top 10-12 students get funding but then there will be another 10+ who get offered places in case they are either rich or can find funding from their own country once they have the written offer to show around.\n\nMy suggestion would be to email (or maybe better speak online/phone so they'll be able to be more honest) with your supervisors, explain that you might not be able to take the place without funding. Maybe they could offer you a part-time research assistant role but for a full-time course you're not allowed to work more than 20 hours a week usually and during holidays. So that would only be around \u00a310k a year for a guess, probably less, but that might cover all your living expenses/accommodation. \n\n\u00a325k is just the annual fees... so you'll need roughly budget \u00a34-7k on top of that to rent and live depending on your lifestyle and where you are in the country. That's a big outlay over 3-4 years (and you should budget for 4). You need to look at whether it will be worth it compared to studying in your home country or the EU for a fraction of the cost, is the University really worth around \u00a385k more than an EU one? \n\nFinal thought, stay in the process as long as you can before pulling out. This is because funded places do come up late sometimes due to funded people having multiple funded offers and going elsewhere. You obviously can't count on this but think of it like a queue, you want to stay in it as long as possible to give yourself a chance in case someone in front quits. \n\nGood luck, and if you do withdraw it's not the end of the world.

I have been working with the same dataset for 4 years, it's very hard to keep the same passion, for example.\n\nNow, as people here also often says, a PhD is a means to an end. And, to me, that end is not a phase. Regardless of what I feel about my socialization or my data, for example, I never wavered on my goal to become a professor. Even during the hardest parts of my PhD journey, I knew I was getting closer to my goals. The PhD is not the life I wanted, but it takes me to the life that I want. The pandemic is not a representation of how things will be for the rest of my life. \n\nSo, whether it's worth it or not depends on what you will get out of the PhD. If you will get something that really matters to you or not. You don't need to push through just because it's part of the process. In my opinion, it's not a matter of perseverance.

You can go through the syllabus with her and try to identify which specific topics she needs the most help with. When you present it in this way, she might be able to ask specific questions.

There are plenty of appropriate places this student can turn to, and personalised coaching or feedback from you is not one of them.\n\nIf you're meeting in person, my advice is to go into it with a clear time frame. My teaching roles include student consultation, which we typically aim to keep to &lt;20 minutes (because more than that is becoming a personalised tutoring lesson!). Be professional and friendly and let them know right away that you're happy to answer any specific questions, and that a consultation is typically about 15-20 minutes. Throughout the meeting, speak directly to the content and if they are asking for additional coaching on a question you have clarified already, advise them that it's best to jot that down for their personal additional study/research, and encourage them to move on to their next question \"so you can make the best use of this consultation time\". \n\nAt 15-20 mins (if it even goes that long) let them know you've got time for perhaps one more question. If they clearly have more questions/want more from you, advise them to email whoever is running the course directly- I GUARANTEE that person will respond with far less personalised info than you are!! Do not tell them to email you - they won't stop. If they clearly have quite a few more, this is now appropriate to bypass you and point them directly to the person running the course.

But I realize it's not for everybody, but it maybe worth trying. I mainly did it because I used to be an EMT for 911 and often we'd be so busy that there was no time to eat on shift, so that was 12-16 hours without food. I just got used to it.\n\n2. Also, I bought an air fryer on amazon for like $70 a few months ago and that is the literally the best money I've ever spent. I'm not exaggerating when I say IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. I am someone who absolutely HATE HATE HATES cooking because of how long it takes and mess it makes (all the reasons you listed basically), but the air fryer makes it so fast and easy. I can squish a block of tofu, throw it in there, and it comes out light and crispy in 10 minutes-I don't even need to add oil to cook it in since its non stick. Just throw it in there as is. Microwave some frozen veggies for 5 minutes while the tofu is in the air fryer and there's my meal for the day. If I'm feeling fancy, I'll add half an avocado too. It only takes 15 minutes from start to finish. Plus the air fryer is super easy to clean. I can put the fryer part right in the dishwasher. You can also put down foil in the fryer basket to minimize how much you need to wash it, then just throw the foil out after your food is done. I might only wash it in the dishwasher once or twice a week. The whole process is quick, healthy, and no mess. And you can cook pretty much anything in the air fryer-meat, veggies, whatever your heart desires, there's probably an air fryer recipe for it. After I bought it, my husband learned how to use it and now we fight over it. Usually like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWZ5Shp3A1s), but about the airfryer.\n\nHonestly, the air fryer is what has made it so easy for me eat only whole healthy foods because I never had time to cook either.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u0c8r7/weird_question_food/i49gx5l/"}, "2212": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1649658628, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

I meet with my mentor for lunch every other monday (since covid we've just done zoom lunches together).

Patent and IP law are very different in other countries so I can't speak to those). The institution probably has IP rights and the government doesn't mess around. I'd wager somebody somewhere on the project has already signed some paper about IP to the military. Particularly if the military is funding the work. Patents are public and require exquisite detail so anybody can receate the subject of the patent. So if the military wants to keep it a secret, you likely won't even be allowed to try and patent it. Alsp patents are thousands of dollars and a lot of work to get through successfully (can take months to a year). And you have to be able to write a strong patent that can't be loopholed around (this is a whole specialty of legal practice called patent law). Otherwise somebody can basically just take your content because the patent wasn't iron clad in its wording.\n\nI'm not as familiar with copyright. Brief googling makes me think you might be able to copyright source code but not an algorithm itself (not sure about this though). But again if the military is funding the work, I don't think you can tell them they can't use it.\n\nI'm sorry to paint such a disheartening picture.

Are there any skills other than research that your time there will allow you to gain ?

In the process I will brush up on those skills in a different and more difficult environment which ultimately will benefit me in my future career whether in academia or not.

Independently of your field, writing skills are really crucial in doing a PhD. I also use a spellchecking software. I think the key point here is that writing is not only a question of language proficiency. It may be also the *quality* of your writing that could be improved -- e.g., how you structure arguments, the quality of references you provide. High quality writing only comes with practice. A lot of practice. The best ways that I found to improve the quality of my writing is always doing my absolute best to ensure that each sentence is concise, clear, and precise, that the logical structure underlying my arguments is sound, and that all of my claims are backed by appropriate references. If I'm unable to do this for a specific argument, I add a comment in the margin. I limit the ambiguities in my writing or I acknowledge them so that my supervisor can chime in easily. I need to find the text to be almost perfect before reaching out to him.\n\nSure, it is also your supervisor's job to enrich the text with improved references for example.

I'll write a few things.   \n\\- You need to be more specific than just business. Applications are for specific fields (e.g., Finance, Marketing) or even specific research tracks (e.g., Quantitative Marketing). Many details about the PhD application can be different depending on that.  \n\\- GPAs are usually not very important.   \n\\- A PhD is quite different from an MBA, and an MBA often adds little value. You need to be sure you can convince people that you really want a PhD, that you really know what you are doing. Enjoying the academia environment as an undergrad or MBA student is not enough to do a PhD.    \n\\-  Without any research experience, it will be very hard to get into top schools. You also need to see if you can get strong letters of recommendation from professors who are active in research, as that's another important factor.   \n\\- Choosing the right school is a huge task. You need first to know what you want to do (e.g., research interests) and what you want to get out of a PhD (e.g., become an assistant professor at an R1 university in the US). Then you need to do your research to know which universities are better suited for that, including the potential advisors.   \n\\- Although  the website is not very active anymore, you should find a lot of useful information if you go to the business PhD section or Urch.com  \n\\- This is one of the most used ranking systems used by PhD applicants to know the strength of a program, although may be some which are more specific to your field:  \nhttps://jsom.utdallas.edu/the-utd-top-100-business-school-research-rankings/  \n\\- Business PhD programs are usually extremely competitive. People usually apply to something like 15 universities, and even very strong applicants are rejected everywhere. Top 20 programs are very unpredictable, not even the strongest applicants focus only on that. I'd say top 50 is a more common range, but without research experience you may consider including schools below that too.   \n\\- Although the school rank matters, don't focus too much on that. Some of the best researchers work for lower ranked universities which give them more power and freedom to do what they want to do.   \nLet me know of further questions you have.

Specifically, this is in the realm of biomechanics and exercise physiology (cue ignorant jeers from those who think the field is just about being a glorified P.E. coach, as lots of people who love role-playing as gatekeepers of \"real science\" tend to do just that).  \n\nOn an intellectual level, that man stood head and shoulders above the others in the department who had PhDs.  He embodied what I personally think a scholar should be to a far greater extent than anyone else there, even if I didn't have a lab that was as much of a publication mill as some others (publication is not the sole currency of scholarly contribution -- particularly when you're cranking it out in a \"quantity over quality\" sort of way).\n\nSome context for my field:\n\nHistorically, many modern programs in kinesiology, exercise physiology, biomechanics, human performance, etc. came out of *physical education* programs, as the study of exercise and related human function often stemmed from interests developed by those who worked physically with people in an exercise capacity.  As a result, graduate degree programs grew out of those disciplines and were often subsumed under their respective institutions' College of Education (or some equivalent), and it was quite common for the terminal degrees conferred to be EdD degrees.  These people often collaborated with PhD-holding biologists, MDs, etc. to extend their skill sets and scope, but they absolutely pulled their own weight academically.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there's a sort of \"old guard\" segment of the exercise science and phys ed academe who all got EdD degrees and who did some of the really seminal work in the field.  They upheld certain intellectual and professional standards that I think put *modern* PhD programs to shame.  Degree creep and academic inflation hasn't just occurred *between* degrees; it has also occurred *within* them, as I see some utter morons getting PhDs in my field now (as well as in others), and I don't hold much hope that they'll ever mature into anything resembling the now-retired generation of EdDs who helped to initiate me into this field.\n\nI can't speak to other areas with as much confidence or certainty, but I can absolutely say that there is sufficient overlap in my area that speaking in any absolute terms about which degree is \"more legit\" will make you look like a fool.  The EdD and PhD are both considered terminal and, while not identical in the areas of expertise that they tend to cover, certainly can afford enough expertise in either case for the holder to do phenomenal work in this field.  EdD holders are more commonly in positions of administration or phys ed (since they often came from education-oriented programs), but they definitely do research and are not inherently deserving of any less respect than their PhD-holding counterparts.\n\nThere's room for both, and I'm glad that that is the case -- at least in my discipline(s).\n\n/rant", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/to0n24/ive_had_my_phd_for_four_days_and_was_already_told/i4s8384/"}, "3005": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ChewChewMod5", "Date": 1649989599, "Score": 1, "Body": "Unfortunately it could.

Here are my suggestions!\n\n1. Reformat your CV a little to really highlight your work.  Look at some examples online.  I am unclear on what you mean about co-authoring a textbook, but if that is what you actually did, that should be under publications, and it should be at the top of your experiences, as one example of what should be reformatted. \n\n2. Start this summer identifying faculty in programs you are interested.  Start talking to those faculty as soon as possible.  Keep in mind many of them will be out during the summer, so it\u2019s good to pace yourself on this project.  Forming a good relationship with faculty members will be your best guidepost on what programs will be interested in you.\n\n3. Neuroscience is fairly competitive.  Consider some related fields too, just in case.  I\u2019m not sure if your interest, but maybe something like public health, communication sciences and disorders, kinesiology, or gerontology.  You seem pretty in touch with your literature, so consider scrolling through pub med and seeing some of the second and third authors and what fields they are in.  That way you have some \u201cback up plans\u201d.\n\n4. Your GPA is a little lower than average, but your research experience makes up for it.  I would ask / check online for each program you consider what the average GPA is for accepted students, and then be prepared to address it in your cover letter.  It is not such a big deal.  Your research experience is more exciting. But it might mean you won\u2019t get into one of the most competitive programs. \n\n5. Keep in mind that PhD applications are very different from other higher ed applications.  It\u2019s all about relationships and a department\u2019s faith in your ability to excel.  So you might be admitted into really great programs and not make it into your safeties, you might get accepted into all or none, and it might have nothing to do with your actual work.

DBAs are much more of a thing in Europe than in the US, for example.\n\nHaving research experience helps to get into a PhD, but it's not a requirement. If you can make your application strong without experience, you can still get accepted (although that will also be hard because you have no interest in tenure or teaching). I don't know, for example, if you had professors during your MBA who are active researchers with a good reputation and would be willing to write strong letters of recommendation for you.\n\nGenerally speaking, DBAs will not be at the same level of research of a PhD. But it may also depend on what kind of research you want to do. \"Respected research\" can mean many different things. Respected by whom? By people in academia? By practitioners? The answer can make a difference here.\n\nPhDs is really the way to go for academic research in my opinion. However, the amount of work can be huge. I had periods when I worked like 15 hours a day. For many programs, you probably will need to have someone else to manage your successful business and non-profit for years. Just the fact that you have a successful business is a reason for many programs to not accept you, since they will not believe they are doing you anything good by taking you out of your business.\n\nSince you don't want to become a professor, I do think a PhD is a waste of time for you. It's not like you really need to do a PhD to conduct research or publish. In your place, I probably would get closer to professors and academia, read papers from top journals by myself, go to conferences, get a partnership with a professors (especially if you can help research with your own business, providing data or allowing them to run field experiments).

It's just that most people studying in the US and that have never really known any other academic systems outside of the US don't really realize how different the structure of their PhD programs are. So to them when they start their PhD programs after undergrad, it's normal that they consider having skipped any master requirements. But when you compare with the rest of the world what skipping a master degree actually means, you realize it's not exactly that in the US. So not your fault, just different academic systems!\n\n&gt;If I might ask, how challenging was the transition?\n\nI have always been very autonomous and I am used to taking initiatives on my own. I am also autodidact so I am used to teach myself whatever subjects I feel I am missing and need. So from my perspective the transition was very smooth, barely noticeable. I would say the most noticeable difference between undergrad and PhD (outside the US) for me was that there are no classes, no assignments, no deadlines (except for papers/publications or annual PhD reviews of course), etc. You also become the expert in your subject and your supervisors can't really answer any questions you have as they often simply don't know, which took 2-3 months to adjust to at first. Now I can't even remember when is the last time I asked them anything related to the fundamentals of my research. \n\nDepending on your supervisors, you might have little to no support and rarely any feedback as well. My supervisors are very busy, so I meet with them only once a month and sometimes we skip a month. They don't  really keep tab of your progress unless they feel the need to provide more supervision to ensure you meet important deliverables (conferences, publications, annual reviews) or if they feel that your work is not getting anywhere. So you really are the only one who can force yourself to advance your research because they won't do it and you don't have any frequent deadlines that could force you to do so. \n\nA PhD can feel isolating (which is a common feeling shared between PhD students), so if you are an undergrad student who relies a lot on the support/guidance of professors and feel the need to seek validation for your ideas/methodology, etc, the transition from undergrad to PhD might be more harsh. But if you are a very autonomous student, you should have a smooth transition. \n\nBest of luck to you!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/t2y3cb/going_straight_from_bs_doctoral_work/i4y5u91/"}, "3230": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Allispercerption", "Date": 1650114324, "Score": 1, "Body": "Well done and congratulations Dr Nicola!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u4fth7/i_did_it_i_defended_my_phd_today/i4ybla5/"}, "3231": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nikolajanevski", "Date": 1650114462, "Score": 2, "Body": "Performance of sensor fusion for vehicular application.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u4fth7/i_did_it_i_defended_my_phd_today/i4ybuci/"}, "3232": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1650115614, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post has been flaired as \u201cVent\u201d.

I don't really think it was a way to balance my practical experience. It was more like a way to go to a very different direction, and leave my practical experience behind. Among other reasons, a PhD is too narrow to provide that balance in my opinion. I was essentially studying the same dataset for 4 years, I think I would need a broader academic perspective to balance the practical experience that I had. \n\nA PhD is like a job. We are hired by the university, and we learn by working for them. We help them with their research, we teach, we take on administrative duties, etc., depending on the program. So, we are also expected to get paid for it, not pay for it. Business PhD programs attract a lot of competent people, from many fields (like Psychology) because it is one of the few PhD fields that provide good opportunities in academia. At least from what I see here, nobody will take seriously a for-profit PhD. That will damage your reputation instead of helping it. In my opinion, a good MS is a much better choice than a crappy PhD. \n\nAbout your respected research, I will break it down since you mentioned many things. \n\nCertainly not everyone in academia really focuses on publishing breakthrough research. Academic research is very narrow, very slow. We try to make a very small but solid contribution to the knowledge, but they are rarely breakthrough research. Some people are able to do that over their life as a researcher, with a body of research, but even then it often takes years or decades to become a breakthrough research. I think those who want something that would be more of a breakthrough research are those doing research in the corporate world, in industry, not in academia. \n\nAbout becoming a leading authority on the subject. Again, you need to remember that a PhD is extremely narrow. We become a leading authority on the subject, but on a very narrow subject. I'm not a leading authority on business, I'm not a leading authority on marketing (my field), I'm not a leading authority on quantitative marketing or marketing strategy (my research tracks), I'm not even a leading authority on brand equity (my research topic). I may be a leading authority on positive-negative asymmetries of brand equity measurements, but not much more than that. If you ask me about other things, I'm usually not really so different from other people. \n\nAbout speaking at conferences, that's probably something easy to do. Of course it depends on the conference, but there are tons of conferences that should be open to you. \n\nAbout being invited by more experienced researchers, it really depends on what you have to offer them. Again, I think the best thing you have to offer them is access to your business. Many researchers look for companies willing to partner with them. I think many of them would be more than willing to help you, teach you, advise you, regardless  of you not being a PhD student or a professor. \n\nAbout impact in your industry. Again, that makes me think of research conducted in industry, not in academia. Academic research can have an impact, of course. But many of the major tracks and researchers in academia don't really care about that. At the very least, you should be very careful about your choice of research track, advisor, and program, if you want to have an impact in your industry. I certainly know professors who would say \"well, do a masters then instead of a PhD\". \n\nYou should be aware that many PhD students start dreaming about breakthrough research and impactful research, but end up being very frustrated, and disillusioned. Specially for business PhDs, many students who are more inclined to a corporate, industry mindset end up leaving the program after some time. Because they see they could be making much more of a difference doing something else instead of a PhD. Five years of intense work in industry can have a huge impact, but five years of intense work in a PhD will barely make any difference (unless your goal is to become a professor).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u4tmhl/scholar_practitioner_obstacles_phd_or_dba/i4z782r/"}, "3264": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "UnderstandingAfter72", "Date": 1650128525, "Score": 1, "Body": "I workout, and have been doing so consistently for a number of years.

It's quite meditative. Often times, you just have to switch your mind off and do those reps, not think too much and just let your body do. Other times, you can get your frustration out and get angry at the weights, and trow them around. It's really satisfying seeing weights progress too! Like, going from a single 35kg assisted pull up to 10 pull ups 15kg assisted, finally being able to do push ups etc. Its also nice to see your body change and evolve.

Totally possible that they\u2019re reaching out to gauge your interest but aren\u2019t using the right tone, so it comes across as more blunt/bossy than you may expect. Communication barriers take a while to get through, and it\u2019s taken me months to figure out a good communication style with my PI. Once you can read someone\u2019s email in their voice, it\u2019s a lot easier to understand the tone they\u2019re shooting for. Even more so for young professors. \n\n- Is their research at least aligned with your interests? If so, I\u2019d try and keep the conversation going. As others said, an easy out is for you to emphasize that you aren\u2019t available until the semester begins. Very easy to be like \u201cHey, this sounds really interesting but I still need to wrap up my current position and finish closing and working on my house. Unfortunately, I do not have the bandwidth to take on anything else right now, but I would love to revisit this at the start of the semester when I can start to focus on research.\u201d Show some enthusiasm about it, and they\u2019ll generally be much kinder about you not starting - even if you never work for them. \n\n- If you can still set a time to meet them and their students that will help you gauge how they really are. \n\n- Is there a chance you would actually like this project?

I'm not entirely sure how many jobs there are in a year. I can tell you that most corporate law firms in \"Big Law\" have a patent group. Most will hire PhDs for patent prosecution (i.e. getting a patent into the hands of an inventor) continually to meet client needs. There are fewer opportunities on the side of IP litigation (i.e. enforcing or invalidating patents in court) but I think the field is trending towards hiring more of us.\n\nTo address this comment, that's not entirely true. To interact with the patent office, you need to become a patent agent by passing the patent bar exam which test patent procedures and requirements. To qualify for the patent bar exam, you need a Bachelor's degree in a \"hard\" science. More information here: [https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/OED\\_GRB.pdf](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/OED_GRB.pdf).\n\nIf you work at a firm, typically you will start out as a Technical Specialist or Science Advisor and do patent agent-like work under the supervision of an attorney. The firm will then typically pay for a patent bar exam prep course and then you continue your job as a Patent Agent (instead of a Technical Specialist). There are a number of people who become Patent Agents and do not go to law school. You can work at a firm or in-house or even self-employed as a patent agent. If you do decide to go to law school, you can take on additional tasks related to evaluating patent portfolios, due diligence, etc.\n\nIn patent litigation, you similarly do not need a PhD to start out at a firm. You will primarily be working with experts as well as a number of other technical tasks to support litigation under the supervision of an attorney. Most Science Advisors in IP Litigation do attend law school to become attorneys. All of the firms I know of will cover the cost of law school (including the cost of prepping for the LSAT and applying). I'm in a 4-year part-time program now. It's definitely a big time commitment, but--as opposed to my classmates--I will graduate without taking on any student loan debt and I am paid a very generous salary even though I am working fewer hours.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u5uc8q/job_opportunity_in_us_outside_of_academiathe_lab/i54ky9n/"}, "3467": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1650228973, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

So I\u2019ll start by saying that intellectual property is broadly broken into two categories: patent prosecution (getting a patent in the hands of an inventor for their invention) and litigation (enforcing or challenging patents in litigation in the federal court system). Most opportunities for PhDs are in the patent prosecution space since you are drafting patents which are fairly technical documents. However, there are a growing number of opportunities in IP litigation for PhDs as well. I will emphasize that reading and writing are critical skills for both paths.\n\nAs a Science Advisor in IP litigation, you\u2019ll assist legal teams in the technical aspects of the patent law suits. This may involve identifying and working with experts in the relevant field who will opine about the infringement and validity of patents, searching for prior art publications to understand the state of the art or to develop invalidity strategies, prepping for and attending depositions, and a number of other tasks to help your client achieve a desirable outcome in court/settlement. The day-to-day is constantly changing since you\u2019ll be involved in a number of cases, each of which may have a timeline from start to finish over a couple of years.\n\nIn patent prosecution, your day may be spent drafting new patent applications and responding to the patent office about why the invention is patentable. You may also assist with due diligence or freedom to operate analyses under the supervision of an attorney. Once you\u2019ve been working as a Science Advisor for about a year, most firms will have you take the patent bar exam\u2014a certification that allows you to register as a Patent Agent and interact directly with the patent office. More info about the patent bar exam can be found here: [https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/patent-and-trademark-practitioners/becoming-patent-practitioner](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/patent-and-trademark-practitioners/becoming-patent-practitioner)\n\nIn both paths, many people choose to go to law school, although it is not required. Most firms will cover the cost of your law program while working. You don\u2019t take on student loan debt (unlike most of my classmates) and you are still paid well by the firm. I\u2019m currently in a 4-year part-time evening program.\n\nBefore I share the job postings, I\u2019ll mention that this is a connection-heavy industry. Having someone pass along your resume is much more effective than cold applying to a posting you find online. I am aware of a number of positions at multiple firms that are filled by referral rather than ever sharing a job posting. I didn\u2019t know that when I was trying to get my foot in the door in this field, which is why I am trying to make myself available as a resource to other PhDs who may be interested in IP but don\u2019t know how to get there.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve included two examples below\u2014one is a litigation role and the other is more of a prosecution/transactional role.\n\n[https://www.goodwinlaw.com/job-opportunities/dc-lat-science-advisor-ip-litigation](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/job-opportunities/dc-lat-science-advisor-ip-litigation)\n\n[https://www.goodwinlaw.com/job-opportunities/bos-lat-science-advisor-patent-agent-bio-chem](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/job-opportunities/bos-lat-science-advisor-patent-agent-bio-chem)\n\nI\u2019ll share the compensation from my job hunt a few years ago. I was fresh out of grad school and had no prior patent or legal experience. My offers generally spanned the range of $95k-115k (+ bonus), but this included positions in both prosecution and litigation in firms of different sizes in different parts of the country. Most firms have an annual review process that includes annual raises, but this may not be the case everywhere.\n\n**If you have any other questions or would like to speak more about a Science Advisor role in IP litigation (especially if you have or will soon have a PhD in bio/chem/etc \ud83d\udc40), shoot me a DM and we can setup a time to chat.**", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u5uc8q/job_opportunity_in_us_outside_of_academiathe_lab/i55hkp1/"}, "3507": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "[deleted]", "Date": 1650244661, "Score": 102, "Body": "There should be another circle, far to the right of 'What the referees want', that's just 'Reviewer 2'.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u616bk/you_can_work_on_what_you_want_in_a_phd/i55kcel/"}, "3508": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "city_meow", "Date": 1650245114, "Score": 4, "Body": "I 100% understand the frustration and I've also been there as well.

Progress is progress, no matter how slow.\n\nOthers have mentioned already, but therapy (if you have access) could help you assess your emotions from another perspective. It won't solve your problem instantly, but addressing the root cause is helpful even if it takes a few months to deconstruct.\n\nBased on the post, it sounds like you might have some decision fatigue in terms of all the different potential things you could be doing right now without a clear direction of where your research will be in X weeks or months. I think goal-oriented tasks are much easier to focus on because there is more purpose than sitting down to randomly read the first of 300+ publications. Even if your goal is somewhat contrived at first, it will lead you down a path of topics that you realize is not right for you. Then you know you can close that path and walk backwards to find another goal, another path. Finding your way is not easy and it takes time, but if you keep walking, eventually you create a map of the research landscape.\n\nSince it's relevant, I'll also share that I'm a PhD coach that supports PhD students with academic success and professional development.

I also know of all the tricks. Doesn't help. I sit at my laptop - trying to make something happen six days a week, 10 hours a day - I know you're not meant to and this isn't efficient but there's so much to do.  I have too many fields to bring together. \n\nI wasn't a great student at UG or Masters, but I worked hard, was organised and was a good solid student. I also have 15 year of work experience that required really good time and project management. I thought these skills would get me through a PhD. I just wanted to be mildly competent.  In my first year I was told my writing and conceptual understanding was like a first year UG. So I am objectively terrible at this. the only thing I'm confident about is that if there's a bell curve of PhD students. I'd be at the wrong tail end. I could go on, but it's all a bit of a ramble as well!  I wrote this 16 months in - the title is misleading - what it should have said was what if you don't have imposter syndrome. What if you're just objectively a bad PhD student. [https://phdwomenscot.wordpress.com/2020/06/18/im-not-good-enough-to-do-this-phd-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/](https://phdwomenscot.wordpress.com/2020/06/18/im-not-good-enough-to-do-this-phd-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/)\n\nI don't have advice except to say, I felt like I was failing as it is expected that you spend the first year understanding and grasping the literature. It is only now three years into the PhD that I have a glimmer of critical understanding to grasp the literature. I spent almost every hour of almost every working day for 2.5 years to get to an acceptable draft of my literature review (i.e. what others do in a year). My supervisors now think my conceptual grasp of the literature is decent. So I've got there in the end, through the tears.\n\nI honestly have no idea what I'm doing, what I'm writing, what I'm trying to research, I wake up exhausted. But somehow after three years I have written a thesis shaped thing. It's at the scrappy crappy draft stage. But there are sentences, in all the chapters of the thesis. And I'm still not thrown off the course. So it's possible, even for objectively rubbish PhD students like me. That's all I can offer. Which isn't helpful. \n\nTo get through it, I just tried every strategy going.  An attack at all angles strategy. \n\nEvery week I plan my daily schedule, every night I plan the next day via half hour chunks. Every few months/major milestone I have a weekly target and a countdown to weeks left for each major milestone. Sometimes I would pretend I was in an exam - you have one hour/two hours to answer this topic. I don't often meet my own targets. Shame and disgust at my laziness and uselessness is a permeant feeling. But it gives me forward momentum. But this won't work for everybody - I have a friend who couldn't cope with targets and got crushed by the guilt of missing them. And sometimes if the brain fog is too much, I just collapse in a heap and give myself the day off. And hug my dog.

They were always a bit self centered but my disabilities made it extremely apparent. I got enough care to start back at my bachelors degree, fell into chemistry and biology and kept being encouraged to apply for a PhD. By the time I was finishing my bachelors my spouse and I were struggling even worse, she was transitioning which I was extremely supportive of, but she was so focused on that she couldn\u2019t really talk about anything else for months on end and  she would only make time to see me about once a week becahse she had many hobbies that were time intensive. We separated at the bringing of 2020 and when we couldn\u2019t reconcile and decided to end it I was two weeks into my last semester of undergrad. I was told to move out of the house  immediately. Neither of my parents could help, and she wasn\u2019t willing to do more than load a couple heavy things into my car. I am disabled with a port in my chest to keep fluids infused to keep me from passing out, but I moved my stuff to my parents house in a few car loads, she kept almost everything that wasnt explicitly mine. By November I was finishing up my last semester, applying to grad school, and dealing with a divorce lawyer. My ex told me I \u201chad the advantage in the divorce\u201d being disabled with little income (I worked 12 hours a week on top of school during the year and 36 a week in the summer)  and fought very hard to give me what she \u201cthought was fair\u201d which was of course not a lot.  I refused to touch certain things like her retirement account, but of course I had to replace almost everything and start over. In the end I sold my car, which was tough for me because I always thought of it as a back up living space, and used that to help set me up for my PhD studio apartment (despite my parents good fortune they don\u2019t help me financially beyond some groceries every few months\u2026 they feel like I shouldn\u2019t need it in my 30s regardless of circumstance) At 32 I was starting all over again, but this time with sky high medical bills in an expensive part of the city. My collegues all get takeout most days and talk about weekend trips and I can\u2019t relate. I got lucky this year to come into grant funding for COVID that also covered people with medical expenses, but that won\u2019t be the case for the years to come .  Since I didn\u2019t have those bills to pay I was able to scape enough together for a car by cohabitating and keeping my budget super strict. I needed it to get to my specialists who are scattered across the region and hard to get to by train, I have a difficult time getting groceries home, and the sidewalks on my current route to campus aren\u2019t wheelchair accessible. I tried to avoid it and feel guilty about it but cost wise I would have spent more on Zipcars, Uber, train tickets and bus tickets.

We could have been in a decent place financially, but my father gambled massive amounts of money away. I always envied kids having nice meals and snacks at school. I was living in a constant rage and torment from our fathers abuse, and I fled into my studies. My grades, my scores felt like a matter of life and death. I was hooked on biology. My teacher was really nice, I often participated in competitions. I even had a small project about monitoring contamination levels at a local swamp where a spring returned after decades of coal mining in my town. I was poking around in the swamp all proud with my little yellow wwf case full of paper-strip indicators and plastic cups. I would cry hysterically when I saw trash in the river near my home. I wanted to save the world. \n\nMy family mocked my when I told them I want to become a bioengineer, saying I won't make any money. I was deeply hurt, but I proceeded anyway. I got into the nicest uni in the country, moved to the capital, and felt like my life will start finally. Right about the start of the third semester, my father committed suicide, after we found out that he was cheating my mum. Our world shattered, he had so many debts we knew nothing about, and my mother had to take care of us three kids all going to school alone, burdened with a loan on the house. I started to do terrible at uni. I received some money from the state, but I had to spend it all on failed credit fines. I was learning hard, but when the exams came, I just couldn't face the teachers, I was terrified of them, so I just didn't go to any exam. I was becoming extremely poor, but I didn't tell anyone about it. I would sneak out at night to eat from the trashcans at the dorm I was living in.\n\nA moment came when I had to make a decision, fail university or make my situation work somehow. As a last resort, I applied to a lab for an internship, to work on my thesis. I was so lucky. I got into a wonderful group, my supervisor was kind and patient. A senior guy in the group would sneak biscuits and instant noodles in a cabinet at the lab, for me and another PhD student who couldn't afford food. I made friends. But I was still very poor. I had to work a night job. Sometimes I slept in the engine room of the institute on the floor, because I didn't want to go home, and I was not eligible for a dorm room anymore. I was working my ass off at the lab and I won a national competition for my thesis, but when I walked up to take the prize, I just wanted to scream in agony. It was a struggle, but I graduated. Then I got offered a job in another lab, and took it. It was terrible. I couldn't make a connection with anyone. So I left after a year. Spent three months in Shanghai on an internship. I made a couple of friends. But the stipend was so low, I had to go through the trashcans again. All my friends were super rich, and would invite me to expensive restaurants. I accepted, and blowed half a months stipend one night, just to feel less alone.\n\nI applied for a PhD back in my home country, and everything was relatively fine. My work and dedication was appreciated. Finally I had enough money to live a decent life. But I feel alienated from my peers. I try to act normal, but I just feel so broken.  When I am under pressure, I crumble. I did a lot of drugs during the years. I feel like ruined my mental health. Sometimes I cannot think straight. Somehow I got to visit a nice lab in Germany during the summer for three months, and everyone was so kind. I was trying to be friendly too, but I felt like I must work really hard. They were so much better than me. Smarter, more confident, easygoing. I was crying while biking to work, I was crying when I was going home. I felt like I could never catch up to them, but by some miracle, they appreciated me, and invited me back for a postdoc. I came back to my home country again and I was looking at postdoc stipends, but it turns out...I am not good enough for any of them. I just don't have the necessary if on my papers to have any chance. I broke down, and I haven't recovered since. I have been slacking on my job, I am far behind a number of projects. I have a student with a thesis deadline in a week, but I keep avoiding him. I feel so ashamed. I feel like I cannot hold on any longer to this stupid dream that I could become a scientist. I am already massively overwhelmed, and this is just the baby level. How could I even think about going further? I don't know what to do, I tried therapy, I tried talking to friends, but it didn't get better. I look up to my collection of biology textbooks once displayed proudly filled with doodles of me in a lab coat from my childhood and I am filled with dread. I don't know if I can hold on any longer.

I'm not saying that's the standard or common, but there were periods that I worked more than 15 hours a day. Research at a critical stage, classes to teach, conferences approaching, multiple deadlines very close to each other. \n\n\\- Sometimes, it was the opposite. Not much happening, specially when I needed something like an IRB approval or a feedback from my very busy advisor to be able to really move on with my work.

Again, not the standard, but it happens from time to time. \n\n\\- Some tasks are much easier than others. Depending on what I'm doing, I can work very long hours and be totally ok.

I had a lot of emotional security.\nMom has a profession and now a business, but my dad can barely get his high school degree recognized here despite getting 3/4 of the way through an engineering degree in Nicaragua.

And I completely agree with you that there are extremely well off people of color who get into academia\u2014and this is rarely discussed as it\u2019s own form of socioeconomic privilege. \n\nAs an example, my partner and I have a lot in common even though we don\u2019t look it.

Honestly, it\u2019s part of what makes me feel shitty about having \u201cdiscussions\u201d about equity. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re good at decoupling the optics from our discussions about equity. And we\u2019re not able to admit that to ourselves. \n\nSo since I\u2019m usually invited to speak in those spaces, I\u2019d love to be better at turning the conversation to socioeconomic barriers of academia rather than only ethnic ones, because I truly think it\u2019s more relevant to improving access to education and academic spaces.

This is gonna be all over the place and be triggering probably: \n\nHave been homeless a few times in my life and deal with severe mental issues due to it meaning although my academics have been good, it has not been without struggle (which I'm glad they didn't but also I feel so alone).I don't have family outside of my mom who I have been the caretaker for since I was 16. We survived incredible domestic violence and in the process I was almost placed in the system a few times but was lucky enough to have a friend's family that raised me for a while. My dad was a middle school drop out and my mom went back to community college before I was born but had to quit due to her health and never went back due to my dad.  I was starved as punishment, forced to dress certain ways to keep my dad happy, and had to tolerate sexual, verbal, physical, and mental abuse from both my parents. I had three siblings, one in foster care, one who became an addict as well and abondened me to be with her drug dealer boyfriend, and my older brother who is in a religious cult who took advantage of his trauma. My home situation led me to being very vulnerable to others and I was groomed and assaulted multiple times, even by a cop. I was comepletely dissociated from my life and at this point was in crisis and at risk programs. I discovered I developed \"parts\" to cope and some were incredibly reflective of my parents abuse and led to severe self harm. \n\nMy homeless eras were marked mainly by my coming out in which I cut my hair and was kicked out, and by my mom's mental collapses where she became so dysfunctional that she either was threatening us or her own life or during the time we were getting away from my dad or the times my dad attempted shit like breaking in, kidnapping, and other wonderful things that lead to me having to live anywhere I could, my car, a friend's couch whatever. My mom has worked A LOT to better herself and has apologized for many of her wrongs and worked to make things better. My dad still is himself but luckily away from us.\n\nWhen we did move, I also became fiscally responsible for my mom and myself meaning I worked 2 jobs while finishing high school. She had disability and child support but rent in my state is insane. She couldn't help pay for clothes or gas or food often times because it all was going to rent or hospital bills. During this time as well, we spent days upon nights in the ER due to her health issues becoming chronic and horid. I drove a limp body and did CPR on my own mom at least three times. When I was 17, I was on a really bad path after a suicide attempt and was heading for another one. I got heavy into some shit and was discovering I had CPTSD and potentially a dissociative disorder. I chose to go to college and give life one more chance. \n\nNo plan, no actual desire to go or be alive, only the drive of knowing the one thing my mom had always fought for was for me to have a future and that meant being a first gen student. This was the best thing I could've done. For the first time I felt like I was in the world not just surviving it. At the same time, I felt isolated as my story was so different from others. Over the years, my brain has become less shattered and learned who I actually am and how to cope with all that I have endured. I have been in therapy for five years, worked with social workers for eight. THANK GOD I have had supportive professors and admin because my God I've had bad breakdowns over dumb shit but also had to miss classes and meetings to take my mom to the hospital or doctors. Unlike high school where I had to tell a court why I was truant, they respected that I was responsible enough to get my assignments done and be active in class and didn't make me feel guilty about being a caretaker. It made me relax for once and i found my passion for life in research that lets me express myself while discovering the a microcosm of my field. I do get discouraged by the privleged conversations, complaints, and ignorant comments (I've def heard some...\"jokes\" about welfare parents, comments like \"why don't people just leave abuse\" and blaming poverty and disease on those stuck in the system). \n\nA lot of people pity me. They don't sit and listen to my story I get one sentence in and it's \"aw I'm so sorry\" like don't be sorry, listen to me if you can. It's my life. And my life is not sorry. I didn't just survive, I persevered and academia needs to acknowledge that this black and white of labels isn't a true reflection of what happens in the world for those from lower socio economic places or places of less privelege in general. ON THE FLIP SIDE. I hate the presumption that nobody in academia has been in this position, that we couldn't have possibly made it into the room.

I've done lots of work that involved figuring things out or lit reviews for other projects that were the lab's work, but not my own personal projects.\n\nNow, if you were say looking for your own grants and writing proposals that he took, it would be different, but I'm not sure this is the case.\n\nRegards authorship, now usually making a substantive contribution to the planning of a project warrants authorship, and I'd say you have a definite case to ask for this - There's littany of reasons why you shouldn't expect 1st author, but being on the paper is fine.\n\nRegards project meetings. Well, if your contribution is just the planning, then it's just the planning. You can ask for your due credit, but you can't ask for extended 'ownership' of the project unfortunately. This might be because your supervisor already has projects for you to work on that you can't come away from, it might also be because the grants mandate that the project funding support a new PhD position (many grants do). In either case, you're kinda up a creek if you want to be more involved.\n\nYou can always ask, but if your position isn't being funded further, then you're taking time away from projects you have to finish for the PhD, particularly if you are nearing the end. This could be a multi-year project, it wouldn't make sense for you to be on it if you're close to leaving the lab.\n\n&gt;the whole design was my idea\n\nWe don't really have ownership of ideas like this in academia unless you basically get a grant awarded to you personally for that idea. I'm the only auditory expert in my lab, so every auditory perception project has had a number of pivotal ideas of mine in how the experiment is conducted. I'll get a thanks for contributions, and one authorship where I did write some matlab analyses, but just having the idea of how a question could be asked for a paper, this I don't have right to claim as mine.

Don't do your employer a favour or anything like this. The only consideration you should have for being in a job is how it fits you (and family if applicable). Everything else is guff and will not benefit you.\n\nIf you're 100% set on leaving, start looking for a new position/some security, then resign. Whenever you leave, they're going to want to replace you ASAP. They won't want to fund you 3 months anyway, they'll want a new person in 1 month.\n\nIn terms of passion/methods love... First, you don't need to be passionate about your PhD topic and in general I'd say it's a bad idea anyway. In terms of methods - How much PPD (personal and professional development) planning have you done, and how much of that have you involved your PI in? If you have specific skills you wish to develop, you have to advocate for that otherwise you'll just be given whatever tasks are available and silence will be assumed acceptance. This applies to all jobs and PhDs, if you want to work on developing a certain thing, you have to make sure you communicate that so it can be folded into your work. A lot of phds do this idea of separating work and classroom learning, and this is a bad way to do it.\n\nAnother thing is - depending on the field - it's not always wise to be married to a single method. Research that is methods guided is a real problem for many fields. I'm in neuroscience, and there are people who basically say \"Ok, how can I ask this question with fMRI?\" even if that question shouldn't be tackled by fMRI. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\nMy ex worked in hydrology and didn't give a shit for some of the methods for ground water flow etc. but all the methods she enjoyed, still had the same fundamentals - signal processing, time based analyses, so it wasn't such a bother.

Is there *anyone* else who can supervise and would stay out of the way?

One would be to organise group meetings, not just one-on-one things with your supervisor, who is apparently getting you just to repeat issues, doesn't grasp stuff etc. Maybe organise a weekly or bi-weekly meeting with both your supervisor and that distant co-supervisor. Another thought is that you should be very strict with your supervisor. Create clear deadlines and make the project sub-tasks super clear visually. Maybe share a detailed Gantt chart with them or something. Whenever they are getting you to repeat things in a way that's wasting your time, you can say that you are happy with how the issue is and need now to move on to the next task so that you'll finish on time. Another thought is to get started on your thesis. It's not hard to create a skeleton of the thesis and to start writing the basic stuff. Maybe write the abstract and the introduction and the conclusions first, all of which should be consistent. You can write them in a fairly skeleton sort of way and change them later of course.

I've done research in undergrad a bit and even though it was hard and not as exciting as it might have been at a bigger or richer university, I loved getting to see ideas I have become real things and advance the world's knowledge and advance science. I love the thought of my ideas and curiosities becoming testable things that allow me to figure out the answer for myself, as well as the world. I love the thought of one day a curiosity popping into my head, another day beginning the work on answering that question, and another day looking at the answer that I sought out and found. I love the prospect of figuring things out about cognition that no one has ever figured out or known before. Another reason is because I have become involved in comparative psychology as well and I will be conducting research with animals. I think that working with animals is so cool and I'm excited to do it more. When I was a kid I always thought it would be cool to work with animals but thought I probably wouldn't go into a career where I would.

But after how many years of my life I had already previously been sick, I do feel the risks of potentially serious illness outweigh the benefits of travel, at least for the time being.\n\n  \nI\u2019m actually currently trying to come up with a new way to make my topic work. That\u2019s why I declined a guaranteed adjunct position this spring, so I had time to work on it. I\u2019m currently trying to restructure things so I can still complete it with just one more trip as opposed to the numerous ones I was originally intending, even if it\u2019s a year from now, and produce chapters in a different way. Up until this semester, I was teaching too much to really have time to do that, but I\u2019m trying to crack down now and find an alternate way to make this work. I\u2019m also in the process of my first chapter, finally.\n\n  \nMy concern is just, if I TA all of next year, I\u2019m not sure if I will still have time to work on my dissertation as much as I want to and I don\u2019t want to be further delayed.\n\n  \nI entered the PhD program with a master\u2019s in hand. My ultimate career goal is to teach at the college level. I truly love to teach and know that it\u2019s what I want to do. But after teaching 8 of my own classes already in the past 3 years and TAing 8 others before that, being a glorified grader again (which is all TAs in my department do) wouldn\u2019t really help my CV and would really just eat up all of my time. I have taught a lot, earned some teaching certificates, been publishing open peer reviewed essays on topics that I am able to complete without on-site research, presented at conferences, been a guest lecturer, am on a DEI advisory committee, edited a graduate journal, etc. so I\u2019ve still been very active and building what I hope is a competitive CV. It\u2019s only my dissertation which stalled, but I have amassed a ton of background research and notes on my topic.\u00a0\n\n  \nI just don\u2019t think another year of TAing is going to make me more competitive compared to everything else I\u2019ve been doing, unless I\u2019m totally wrong.\u00a0\n\n  \nThe only reason I\u2019m considering it is the money. If I decline, I\u2019d still be in good standing in my department, so that isn\u2019t an issue. I\u2019m also still under on research credits so that\u2019s not a problem either as there is a cap on how many you can register for in the course of your degree. My fianc\u00e9 has a steady job at a non profit that covers our necessities and my tuition is only $3k, but we would bring home a lot less money than we did the past few years and I'm going to need an expensive surgery this year and we just bought a new car since our other was 23 years old and dying. It\u2019s really an issue of turning down the chance for guaranteed money but getting to work on my research with this new plan vs. accepting the TAship and spending 20+ hours per week grading for someone else\u2019s class and my research pushed to the background, again, but getting paid.\n\n  \nI should also maybe note that what we were told many times that the department was offering fellowships. The application my department put out also said that this was for \u201cfellowship extensions\u201d, but only one student was given a fellowship extension (stipend, tuition remission, health insurance, no requirements) and the rest offered TAships so there\u2019s a lot of unhappiness going around.\u00a0", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/u9qae4/unsure_if_i_should_accept_taship_or_not/i5vzfzc/"}, "4854": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1650729155, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

Every person in my program has and has had to complete the totality of their respective department's degree requirements. This can be very institution dependent however, and whether or not the program is MSTP funded. In my opinion though, the 3-4 years is always relative relative given the fact that the program is already coupled with 4 additional years of MD or DO specific education. This is somewhat distinct from traditional PhD programs since doctoral degrees are usually described on a 4/5+ year commitment while dual degrees are 7/8+. Since the baseline length is pitched as being longer, most programs try to make sure the graduate portion does not run long.\n\nAs others on the thread have mentioned, a big detail is the usual ability to start dedicating more time to lab time and research compared to the time sink of classwork, since programs have equivalencies between the credits received during the first two years of medical school. Depending on the school and the way they departmental doctoral requirements are setup, this can sometimes mean that students can only receive PhDs in particular training areas in more medically-affiliated areas like Neuroscience, Physiology and Cancer Biology, and even then it isn't weird for a lot of behind the scenes politiquing to take place. For instance, my program allows up to 30 credits hours from those first two equivalent years to be transferred, most of which were thrown into my Plan of Work as electives, while they still all of the core requirement courses to be taken (which makes sense since it's Engineering). Related to this point as well, most programs stipulate that dual degree students should not be on GTAs for to support their stipend and tuition costs. TAing is having an entirely second job which is a huge time sink. Similar to above, the source of funding is very school and department dependent, and usually the reason why we are pushed right from the start to apply for our own support grants, so it becomes less of an issue for the departments to maybe have to figure out where our support is coming from. \n\nThe most critical component in my opinion is that as a dual degree student, I have the MD-PhD office and my program director as a very valid resource when it comes to discussing project scopes, aims, and above all timeline with my committee. The general expectation in PhD programs is that your advisor is the final say in whether you are allowed to schedule key things like a prospectus defense and a final dissertation defense, and that if they want you to do things like add an aim, run more replicates, work on side projects, and other PI weirdness for the sake of free labor, you have to do so, hence why PhDs can run long. As a dual-degree, if you have a solid project but your PI/specific committee members argue for the need to do any of the things I listed, you have an entire outside entity to your department that can bring the hammer down against your advisor/program director. In my opinion, this latter caveat is the reason why it is sometimes said that MD-PhD dissertations are \"watered down\" science, since this detail can very easily annoy both departmental faculty and other PhD students in your cohort. \n\nFinally, there are stipulations in regards to available funding and grants sometimes drive the timeline. For instance, MD-PhDs cannot apply for most grants out of the NSF and have to go through more clinically relevant funding sources, which sometimes give awards that are shorter in scope (1/2 years). The NIH F30 which is one of the ideal grants to get, requires you apply within 4 years of matriculating to your program (ie. you only 2 years of grad work since the first 2 will be focused on MD stuff) and will fund 4 years of stipend and tuition (2 of which are expected to be the post-PhD clerkship years). This can definitely tie into the previous comment of having your dual degree advisor mention that there is a hard cutoff in regards to the graduate work. \n\nI can also comment that while it is the base plan, there is no reason to say that people don't run long and it is usually because of the anticipated difficulties of any PhD work. If your science doesn't work and you need to redesign, if you're doing animal/cell based work and you they take time to grow or your timepoints are month-long periods, if if adding an extra 8 months of work will make it so you can publish in Nature, you have to take more time, full stop. COVID restrictions and supply chain issues have made the past couple of classes in my program run into 5/6 years for the PhD portion. It's variable, but I can understand that we have the incentive to keep it short. That being said, I know 2 people who got straight PhDs in things like Material Science in 3 years, sometimes the process is nonsensical.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ua9nwo/any_mdphds_out_there_ive_noticed_that_they_finish/i5x9wga/"}, "4905": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1650749753, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post has been flaired as \u201cVent\u201d.

The most mainstream thing I have seen so far is the grimes and poppy collaboration to produce Play Destroy - I had never heard anything like it and thoroughly fascinated by the combination of pop and metal. \n\nHow the music industry works also has pushed metal into obscurity as a genre but there are some places where it is alive and thriving. Metal will always be an acquired taste so now the challenge of upcoming musicians that want to include metal themes is to flavour it imo. Or the inverse occurs where metal is watered down into pop punk and soft rock. \n\nI think all of these branches of the genre are worth considering because these subgenres and the artists have taken inspiration from the bands before. Even the economic value and geographical demand of metal will shape the themes and content of metal music so taking a holistic view can help choose the pieces you want to include.

The PhD experience has been quite different from what I expected, and I still don\u2019t fully understand whether it should have been different or if this is what it\u2019s supposed to be. Although I am part of a lab, I\u2019m not engaged in any kind of teamwork. I do all research work by myself and no one has actually taught me how to do it. A lot of the time that I am not progressing, it\u2019s because I am studying tutorials or taking free online courses to get the knowledge that I need to do my work. My PhD program has no  curriculum, so it was up to me and my supervisors to choose what courses would be relevant for me during the first year. The problem is that none of those courses were hands-on or tailored to my specific needs. So, they didn\u2019t provide me with the expertise I needed. Despite that initial investment, I was still pretty much clueless about how to do most things. I think that\u2019s where postdocs or older graduates come in, and share some of their experience with you. But I had none of that. My other colleagues have also shared the same struggle of having to learn everything on their own without much guidance. We basically work solo, which conflicts with the publicized idea that research is about teamwork. I honestly think this could have all been much easier, if I was given the time to learn all the skills before I had to use them. The minimum requirement should be to have a list of courses and reading materials or even a lab wiki page. The worst thing for me is the time I spend, not taking courses or following tutoriais, but searching for the right courses and tutorials. A lot of the times I only realize the course is useless after I spend hours attending it.

I\u2019ve been looking at buying one for myself. \n\nA nice professional looking bag she can use to carry things around at conferences would also be a nice gift if she doesn\u2019t have something already. \n\nThe meal kit subscription others have mentioned is also a really nice idea. They can be expensive though. A snack subscription of some sort would be a great alternative for that. They are more affordable and can be super fun. \n\nIf she is someone that wears makeup, a nice makeup bag is also great for travel.

Just make sure you know it\u2019s something she likes before you spend the money. I personally hate headphones that go over my ears, I would never use them if someone bought them for me. Meanwhile, a lot of people hate the headphones that go in your ears and would never use that kind. \n\nThere are also some things that she probably would enjoy having that depend on what she studies. I saw someone mention a personalized pipette (a good one of these is EXPENSIVE, it could easily be more than an iPad). If she does something where she needs a lab coat, one with her name on it would be a nice gift. I study cotton, so I grow cotton, I buy a million pocket sized notebooks to take notes in the field. If she does something like that, she may like to have a million tiny notebooks. My boyfriend is working on an engineering PhD, his favorite gifts are coffee mugs with engineering jokes on them (he drinks a lot of coffee, if she is a coffee drinker maybe coffee would be a good gift). \n\nOne of the best gifts you could give her though, is support while she is doing her PhD. They are hard, they are stressful, and they really beat you down.

This has many benefits, but the most important one is that the small tasks look much more doable than a single colossal task. For example, \"writing the thesis\" is a gigantic task that can take hundreds if not thousands of hours.  Your brain will be badly scarred and would prefer not to begin the task at all!! But when you see \"finding papers similar to paper x\" or \"sending email to the supervisor asking about Y\" on your list, your brain would say, \"Hmm, that's doable!\"\n\nAnother idea that I think people usually overlook is to pat yourself on the shoulder for the small milestones you achieve. The educational system and society have conditioned us to celebrate only significant, bold achievements. This works for sprint races but not for marathons like accomplishing a PhD. Small rewards after each baby step is how we should treat ourselves. When others do not see us inching toward our goals, we should keep ourselves motivated by these rewards. These rewards do not need to be physical things; a kind word to ourselves like \"you've got this\" can go a long way.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/uagysj/procrastination_and_phd/i62tcf3/"}, "5120": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "lonecayt", "Date": 1650851957, "Score": 97, "Body": "If you're in the U.S. the government hires anthropologists.

Take what I say with a grain of salt:\n\n1. You first have to sit down and really truly analyze the positives versus negatives of finishing up your degree. Does finishing up your doctorate program and obtaining your degree bring about more positives to your life than negative? For example, is the pay and job opportunities going to be more significant within your field with a doctorate degree than merely a Masters degree and is it worth taking out extra loans or taking on a higher teaching load to pay for your doctorate degree (**occupational benefits/drawbacks**)? Secondly, are you mentally strong enough to see this doctorate degree through? We all know it's going to be hell, but can you persevere through multiple instances of adversity and keep pushing forward? Only you know that (**mental/psychological benefits/drawbacks**). Thirdly, be honest with yourself, are you doing this for yourself or for others? What I mean by that is are you obtaining this doctorate degree for the right reasons? Specifically, for your own interest, obtaining new knowledge, and for increasing your own occupational opportunities. Or rather, are you doing this to appease your parents, reverse the label that has been subtly placed on you by your parents as failure or bringer of shame (**social benefits/drawbacks**)? Again, only you know the answer.\n2. I obviously don't know the full backstory of how faculty screwed you over and thus brought about your mental/physical breakdown. I believe you and will take your word for it, as I'd imagine within the realm of Reddit, you have no reason to lie. While different, I had a similar experience in my doctoral journey in that I've struggled to pass the finish line. I wasted 3.5 years on simply my chapter 2 where within that time frame: I missed countless deadlines (7 in a row with my first dissertation advisor), lost a dissertation advisor partly due to it (took a better job on the other side of the country and only keep the advisees she thought could see out the dissertation, this did not include me), lost basically half a year due to my university's retrenchment of my department faculty (including my second and current dissertation advisor), and sealed with my own mental/psychological health issues due to self-doubt/depression from lack of dissertation progress. I fully admit that much of my downfall during these 3.5 years was much of my own doing and decision making, thus I have nobody to blame but myself for this. However, there were also events that occurred that were out of my control and created barriers for my own success. Ultimately, I had to have that self-reflection, self-realization, and self-chat with myself and ask how I got this point. How was I 5.5 years into a 7-year maximum program where I only had only worked on my chapter 2. A video and dialogue that really summed up my awakening moment was when soccer player Robin Van Persie is talking about his son, who is pouting after not being chosen to play in a soccer game (plays for the youth team of Feyenoord). During the car ride back, Robin describes his son blaming others for not being chosen, to which Robin says, \"You sound like a loser if you talk like this..you sound like you lost. You're blaming him, you're blaming her, you're blaming this, you're blaming everything. But I don't hear a single thing about yourself. Winners take control, they blame themselves and they look where they can improve, and this is what you should be thinking about.\" Essentially, life throws everyone curveballs that you never see coming or expect, tis life. It sucks, it throws one's plans for a loop, it's inconvenient, and it is not fair. We all agree about this point. The question is what are you going to do about it? Are you going to bitch, cry about it (like a child who skinned his knee in gym class), and succumb to the adversity/roadblocks in life or are you going to pick yourself up, soldier on, and barrel through barriers that life throws your way, even one's your own faculty throw in front of you on your way to obtaining your doctorate degree? Again, winner's take control of things only they can dictate and personally control, pay no mind to things out of your hands. For those things out of your hands, deal with them as they come.\n3. I think for the second half of your post, you have to decide whether sticking with your current dissertation advisor is advantageous or not. This also includes your readers on your committee (if you are in a program where you are able to choose your own readers). If you think keeping your current dissertation advisor is more problematic than beneficial, I'd E-mail or schedule Zoom or in-person meetings with potential new dissertation advisors. I always find it strange that people are always under the impression that your dissertation advisor needs to be a person who is an expert on your dissertation topic. For me, both my past and current dissertation advisor were/are not experts on my dissertation topic and I chose them specifically because I had taken their courses, worked with them, and I was comfortable with the type of feedback I received from them. Furthermore, they aligned with the type of relationship I wanted with my dissertation advisor, which was being supportive and being able to meet every month for a check-in. My readers made up my quote unquote experts for my dissertation topic (in writing and disability studies). I would create an outline of what you hope to accomplish within the time frame you have on your dissertation, including a timeline for each major section left, and ask your dissertation advisor if this is feasible. Furthermore, like you alluded to, I would ask him/her if the data collected would be enough for a dissertation defense. I myself, with my limited time frame, actually cut out a follow up interview that I originally intend to conduct on top of my online survey. I asked my dissertation advisor if this was ok and he said yes, as long as I met a certain number of survey applicants (180 minimum so I had. substantial number of respondents whose data I could analyze). Something to think about.\n\nGood luck with your decision OP.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ubidaa/phd_to_return_or_not_to_return/i64pl98/"}, "5220": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Jack-Elliott", "Date": 1650896553, "Score": -4, "Body": "This is all I want to be.

Hopefully some of this advice will help (TL;DR at the end):\n\nLet me start by saying I wasn't nervous about talking to my PI about my disability because I'd had a lot of personal interactions with him already and got the feeling he was going to be chill. Plus, when I thought I might need to take a semester off for family reasons (and I was taking his class), he was very supportive and told me about when he had to do the same after his mom passed. So this part might not be super useful, but I shot pretty straight with him, but not until *I* thought it was interfering with the work. Nobody is going to boot you for a mental illness, especially if it's work you're enthusiastic about.\n\nI'll also say this: any PI that won't work around your class schedule isn't worth your time. I assume you have a qualifying exam? That's your top priority before you pass it and PIs know that; if you can't pass the qual, you're not sticking around. My first year, I only had to work a handful of hours in the lab (5 minimum) since I was taking classes and studying for the qual. My PI (different from the current one) only required *that* because another student years before basically did noth for him for a summer and then dropped out of the program. I worked more after I passed the qual, but still not anything insane since I still had another year of classes.\n\nAbout working yourself to death: you shouldn't have to. I was pulling about 30-40ish a week with no classes when I started with my current PI. I wasn't going to hang around the lab if there wasn't anything to do. What dictates your schedule is the work, not a set number of hours, and you can mold your schedule around the lab work to minimize lab time. That's been my experience in lab work and that's pretty consistent among my cohort. Anyone that tries to tell you you're less of a grad student for \"working\" less hours is an idiot, imo. At my peak, when we were gearing up for a big experiment, I was only *in the lab* a few hours a day because that's what was required for the work to be going basically 24/7. Just me. Probably pulled less than 30 hours a week at that point and I was running two testing stands nearly 24/7.\n\nI don't know what type of lab you're in. I'm doing physics. We make and test targets for an experiment at a national lab. So, while I was developing the testing stands, I spent more time in the lab. I bought a laptop to run the system so I could do some of the coding at home. I set up remote desktop so I could monitor the tests and start or stop them from home. Nobody cared if I wasn't in the lab all day and night since I basically collected useful data whenever I wasn't there and was available via email and phone. I'm sure there's similar ways to automate or simplify things in your lab, you just gotta be creative.\n\nLast piece of advice I've got is be direct and set boundaries with your schedule where you need to. If you need time for something that isn't the lab, that should be fine.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1) I recommend just sitting down and talking to your PI. Build a report. Bring up the mental illness when you feel comfortable.\n\n2) Your focus right now is classes and exams and any good PI is going to work around that for you (and not overload you with lab work)\n\n3) Set hours are pointless. *You* generally set your own schedule. Don't be there for the sake of being there, be there when there's actual work to be done.\n\n4) Automate and set up remote access if you can. I recommend starting tests or data runs or whatever timed things you have to do such that you can maximize data collection and minimize time in lab.\n\n5) Don't be afraid to assert yourself with regards to your scheduling needs.\n\nI hope some of this was helpful.

I live in a country where a PhD lasts \"only\" 3 years. Plus, I was not earning much money, my current wage is around 90% the salary at my previous job. Time and money investment was ok.\n2. When the pandemic began, it was really difficult to find any other cool job or to move abroad and I didn't want to stay there until the end of the situation.

I looked up the PIs first, looked at their funding, their trainees' publication records, time to graduation, etc.  When I met with PIs I came with a short list of questions to try to uncover their management styles -- asking them how often they checked in with each trainee, what types of experiments were performed everyday or every week in their lab (I knew that most PIs didn't do benchwork but I used this question to see how familiar they were with how their trainees were spending their time), etc.  And of course I asked the trainees how their experiences had been, preferably when we went out for lunch or coffee away from the lab.  Trainees were generally very upfront which helped steer me away from some bad situations.\n\nAs a grad student the power balance is a lot more skewed toward the PI or the senior academic.

I want to start PhD in UK, and I want to do part-time phd because:\n\n1) I\u2019ve worked in industry for 10+years. I\u2019m old. I\u2019m not rushing to finish my PhD, but my career goal requires me to have PhD. \n\n2) I think part-time is beneficial because I\u2019ll have more time to learn and perfect my skills. More time to work on my PhD project. So why not?\n\n3) I want part-time PhD so I can either work part time or full time remote work positions. I love remote work and I know it\u2019ll help me manage my time better. \n\nOf course when I started preparing for PhD application, I looked at scholarship options. Most of them are super competitive, but barely pays the full tuition + living expenses! Then why do I even bother applying for these scholarships??? I don\u2019t care how prestigious these scholarships are. If it\u2019s not paying enough, it\u2019s not helping me. I get $30k a year?? For four years!? Woohoo! Not! \ud83d\ude44 I make more than that doing my current part time job. \n\nAnd what do I need in order to get these scholarships? To be enrolled FULL-TIME. Not only do I have to study full time, I will also lose the ability to be able to work on the side. Since I\u2019ll be an international student, I\u2019ll have limits on hours I can work also. So Why do I want to put myself in that predicament?? \ud83d\ude44\n\nI\u2019ve read a few posts on Reddit how the scholarships amount has not changed over time and there has been no adjustments for increase in cost of living. Then I dunno why this is helpful for students, to be honest. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f These schools have locked in these students in full time studies, give them bare minimum for cost of living and for food. And we wonder why so many phd students suffer from mental health issues. PhD studies are tough enough already and us students shouldn\u2019t need to worry about how we need to survive (literally) during our studies. With the cost of living expenses rising so rapidly, I really don\u2019t see applying for funded PhD positions or scholarships for PhD studies only are really worth it (unless these things are able to provide you descent ability to live and study at the same time). \n\nAnyway, enough of ranting. Right now, I\u2019m looking for a better remote position and hopefully start part time phd in September, if not sometime next year. I know my supervisor wants me to try to secure funds (and I think it\u2019s a good skills for PhD students to have that you\u2019re able to win scholarships, grants, etc) but financially speaking, I don\u2019t think it makes sense. Would my supervisor not take me on because I don\u2019t want to secure funding..?

Does moving to the UK represent any kind of opportunity or appeal to your husband? If not and if his only reason for moving would be to accompany you, then that means there's a whole lot more than just your research project riding on the success and enjoyment of your PhD. That being said, higher education is a more internationally mobile sector than most, and there are plenty of cases of couples moving abroad because one of them is doing a PhD. \n\nA more general note of advice I can offer though is that you should probably be very reluctant to self-fund a PhD, unless money is truly no object for you. Funding models for PhDs differ between the UK and the US -- in the UK you'd receive tuition fees and a living stipend for the duration of your programme whereas a US PhD funding package is usually contingent on you doing a certain amount of teaching each year -- but the big takeaway here is that full-funding for PhDs is absolutely normal (which is not to say that it isn't competitive). In the UK, international students generally can't apply for a PhD studentship from one of the big research councils like AHRC, ESRC, etc. Instead, individual universities usually have their own PhD studentships (often called Vice Chancellor's scholarships) that international students can apply for. \n\nIn your shoes, I would start off with what is going to be best for you and your husband as a couple, then from there start following the money (what funding schemes are you eligible for?), then start looking at what specific PhD programmes fit those personal and financial circumstances.\n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/udhc2u/uk_vs_us_phd/i6gy39n/"}, "5757": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "greenbirds", "Date": 1651104754, "Score": 5, "Body": "I definitely understand your frustrations but I think you should reapply.

I think its perfectly fair of you to feel frustrated and angry with not only your advisor, but how your professional/educational plans and goals have been somewhat thwarted. The fact that you know what you are aiming for in terms of occupational position post-graduation and what it takes to make yourself be viewed as a competitive candidate (teaching experience, internship, etc.) is commendable.\n2. Only you know how transparent, honest, and authentic of a relationship you have with your advisor. I've seen advisor/advisee relationships that were genuine all-around, I've seen relationships that were a one-way road, usually only beneficial for the advisor and his/her schedule, and I've seen relationships that were as fake as the goods sold on Canal street in NYC. Only you know the answer to how legitimate your advisor is in terms of looking out for your own best interests and preparing you to the best of his/her ability for life/career after your doctorate program. In saying that, I think it's important to make **very crystal clear** what both your positions are within this particular situation (between OP and his/her advisor) or as some people put it, \"check the temperature in the room.\" You can clarify and tell me if I'm wrong, but in most cases, it is you, the doctoral student who (**1**) seeks out a professor to be your dissertation advisor, (**2**) asks or is given the opportunity/lovely privilege (even though it may not seem that way) to be their TA, and (**3**) seek out your advisor's advice or perspective on various subjects throughout your doctoral journey (classes to take, dissertation advice, job hunting advice, career advice, etc.). **Not the other way around**.  Even though we like to think that we have a democratic, equal, or peer-relationship with our professors, lets not pretend that the postsecondary and academic environment is not rife with inequality in terms of power-dynamics and who has/doesn't have power. Essentially what I'm alluding to is (**A**) don't bite the hand that feeds you (or anger the one person overseeing your dissertation and job opportunities at your institution) and (**B**) professors/advisors don't owe you anything. This includes an explanation or rational behind their decision-making and decisions they've made (sometimes out of the blue, last-minute, inconvenient, and unagreeable) when it comes to your own professional/academic opportunities.\n3. Sometimes professors/advisors view what is best for their pupils or advisees based on their own experience as doctorate students. However, that's just it, it's based on their own unique and subjective opinion/experience. They can't talk or speculate about a life they have never lived. I've had professors who I love and respect who have given me advice in the past on potential publication topics to write about, as well as fields and careers to seek out after graduation. They could not fathom why I did not want to pursue a career in research and preferred to seek job opportunities at the community college level. They always pushed this narrative of \"publish, publish, publish\" because in their eyes, it was the key to obtaining that tenured, 4-year university position. However, when you raised your hand and asked, \"how do I obtain a community college faculty position with job security?,\" it was crickets. Point being is an advisor, while well-intentioned, may not always know what is best for you or your future career. Even if they can help guide you toward a similar career trajectory that you hope to one day achieve, you always have to keep in mind that they're viewing what is \"best for you\" through a really narrow and subjective lens. Their experience and goals may not align with your own experience and goals in life as well (both short and long-term, academically and socially, etc.).\n4. I'm only speculating, but you may also ask whether some of the suggestions and decisions made by your advisor were made out of benefit to them in terms of schedule, time, convenience, and making them look favorable in the eyes of higher ups. Lets not pretend professors/advisors do not make power moves like this. What the reasoning was by your advisor to not allow you to TA or take on a particular internship, who knows, but it's not out of the realm of possibility.\n5. It's perhaps not that your advisor doesn't care about you or the progress you make outside of simply your research, it's just that his/her time is limited and their world doesn't solely revolve around merely you. I don't think I need to remind you considering you are also a fellow doctoral student, but the social/family life versus academic life of many postsecondary professors is incredibly unbalanced. The responsibilities and demands that many professors have includes publishing, teaching, attending conferences, professional development, meetings, and advising. This isn't even including the responsibilities professors have to their family/loved ones. I can only talk from my own experience, but I know for a fact that my dissertation advisor has 13-14 other doctoral students who he advises, as well as the other Masters and doctoral students who have asked him to be on their committee as a reader. It can be easy for me to just say, \"well, you chose this career, suck it up and give me the attention and time I've paid for in terms of my doctoral tuition payments.\" I have definitely felt this way at times in my own doctoral program toward certain professors, but I always bite my tongue or articulate how I feel in a more diplomatic way because I am a firm believer in karma and any negative energy I put out in the world I feel will come back to treat me likewise. As a individual who wants to become a teacher/professor at the postsecondary level and ironically, be in a similar position as of the professors I criticize,  I try to see things from both sides of the coin (student and professor point of view) before passing judgement because I will hopefully be in that same position one day. Hell, you (OP) and I have both TA'd at our uni's and tell me you haven't experienced being belittled (to a degree) or viewed as lazy/insensitive/an asshole for not giving your full, unadulterated attention to a Freshman student who believes the world should bend over backwards for that individual. I'm not saying this is how you (OP) act or feel toward your own advisor. Yet, the underlying similarity is that many students have no idea the time commitments, schedule, and life occurrences going on within a specific professor/teacher's life and in some cases, pass judgement without knowing the whole story (which in most cases, we never will unless a professor discloses it).\n\n&gt;I've always been volatile in the sense that any small comment would completely wreck my productivity for the day, but lately I am having trouble with motivation. I know it's extreme, but all this makes me feel like I'm just wasting my time continuing the PhD and I should just bail out with the Masters.\n\n\\^It would be a shame to get this far in a doctoral program and throw it all away simply because life did not go your way in a few choice instances or you merely feel your your CV will not be as competitive as your had hoped prior to entering the job market (post-graduation). What's a skill that all good teachers have regardless of education level (primary, secondary, postsecondary)? Adaptability. If you consider yourself a good teacher or professor, adapt. This may require you to adjunct for a year or two after graduation as a way to build up your CV, but this doesn't mean you will not be able to obtain that tenured-professor position that many of us strive for in the long-run. It may just take longer than you had hoped.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ud85cm/am_i_wrong_to_be_upset_sorry_for_the_rant/i6i0u8z/"}, "5801": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "GonzagaFragrance206", "Date": 1651123792, "Score": 1, "Body": "I think my last point goes off of my last paragraph above.

I've come across professors who think they are gods gift to this earth and think they are the Michael Jordan of \"insert super niche topic or area of expertise here.\" The term \"ego-maniacs\" or \"delusional\" come to mind. However, the larger point I'm trying to make here is politics, unpleasant co-workers/work environment, and work-related obstacles are all things you will come to expect and deal with in your future profession as a professor. Hell, everybody regardless of job has to deal with these three factors on a daily basis I'm sure, academia being no different. If you can't deal with even one of these three things or in your case, an advisor not being as supportive as you would have hoped, perhaps academia is not meant for you. Being a professor and working within a postsecondary environment can be an awesome and rewarding experience, I'm sure we both can vouch for that. However, at least to me, I'm also aware it's a cutthroat environment, high stress, significant demands on your time, and at times, it can be a thankless job.

I entered my PhD at 27. My primary concern was being too old, which is silly in retrospect, but knowing what I know now, the advice I give to everyone is to really only do it if you have a goal that demands a PhD. I don't think the goal needs to be content specific. Like I didn't have a horribly specific focus or burning question when I entered, but I did have career goals and general interests I wanted to pursue and, luckily, a very good advisor who helped narrow those interests. They won't all be that way and some unfairly expect you to enter as basically a finished product. I think if you just don't know what else to do, PhD might not be the way to go at this moment. At the same time, though, I get not wanting more debt too. There's nothing wrong with working a research position for a year or two to take time to consider your options and to make money at the same time. I'm doing cognitive neuroscience now, but I did two years doing gastrointestinal research at a hospital and made pretty good money doing that. I did that with a psychology degree and a little work experience at a behavioral pharmacology research institute.

Most of the time, I do what I want, when I want, the way I want. There are tons of things to do, it's an overwhelming experience, but at least I can choose how I'm going to deal with them.\n\n\\- The time to think deeply about things. I had a long corporate career before I started my PhD. And in the world of business you don't really have time to think, you need to do things quickly, you need to get results quickly, So, it was nice to finally have time to think, reflect, ponder, research, learn. \n\n\\- The chance to work with amazing people. Not only as researchers, but in many other ways, depending on the person.  \n\nSome of the things I don't like are:\n\n\\- I never know what is going to happen. The situation can change drastically, and then I suddenly need to change my plans. That can happen during the weekend, late at night, from unexpected places or people. \n\n\\- Related to that, how the whole life gets into a limbo. During most of the PhD, I had no idea what waited for me in the future. Specially regarding the place. For example, when I was looking for a job, I even did an interview for a job in Norway. And that would be a huge change in my life.  When the future is so uncertain, I have to put many things in my life on hold. It often doesn't make sense to think about making a lot of friends here, or buying a house, or dating someone when I know my life can turn upside down soon. \n\nPlease notice that things can be very different for you.

I'm a PhD student in my last year. When I was preparing to search for a job, my advisor said that I was a unique type of job applicant for academia. Because I had a much wider range of experiences than the typical PhD student. \n\nSo, although research is really the focus, having more cards to play allowed me to have a different strategy to get a job. \n\nMy opinion is that, if you \"exclusively\" focus on writing research publications, that's all you will have to show when you look for a job. That can be great, if that's what the university is looking for. Many universities are like that, and many job applicants are like that. \n\nNow, I didn't exclusively focus on research. Then, I didn't really have much a chance with the universities which were looking for someone focused on research. But I had much more of a chance with universities that were looking for someone different, because there aren't many people like me out there. \n\nMy CV looks weak compared to many other people that were in the market. No papers published, no hot topics, no famous universities. But I got a job when lots of people with much better CVs didn't. One of those people even asked for a Zoom meeting to know how I was able to do that, what my strategy was.\n\nI can say I was surprised by the things that were beneficial to get a job in my case. So, I think you can't say if something is going to be beneficial or not, until you know what the hiring university is looking for. Sure, all of them are looking for research. But not many of them are exclusively looking for that. \n\nI know my answer is focused on getting a job after graduating from the PhD, not on PhD applications. But a PhD is a means to an end. So, I believe the reasoning is similar. Whether something is going to be beneficial or not depends on what the university (or the department, or the potential advisor) is looking for, or appreciates.

This allowed me to find some use with it, run some models and get something useful. The moral of my story is just because the data looks crap in one light, when observed under a different you might find something useful. Keep your head up, not all PhDs have to produce something ground breaking as long as it enhances the state of the art and you can convince the examiners of it you'll be fine.

For me, it was (**1**) surviving the first semester of the first year in the doctorate program, (**2**) passing the qualifying portfolio (QP) (continue on in the program if you pass and fail out of the program if you fail) before the start of my second semester of my first year, (**3**) surviving the first year in your doctorate program, (**4**) surviving all 2-years of coursework, (**5**) passing your 3-chapter defense, and (**6**) ultimately, successfully passing your comprehensive dissertation defense. I've completed all but #6.\n\nReflecting back on myself and my mates from my own cohort, I've seen the full range of personality types. On one hand, I've seen individuals who were sharp as a tack intellectually, real go-getters, took initiative, were willing to go the extra mile to get a concept, great at multi-tasking, and could time-manage like it was nothing. On the other hand, you had individuals who needed a lot of hand holding, were slow to pick up new concepts, seemed ill-equipped to do doctoral level work, and asked for a lot of help from teachers/classmates alike. You also had individuals who were smack dab in the middle, which included myself. The reason why I bring this up is because I know for a fact everyone of them (including myself) experienced one or several of these feelings/issues to some degree: (**A**) imposter syndrome, (**B**) self-doubt, (**C**) depression, (**D**) mental health issues, (**E**) feeling of inadequacy, and (**F**) burn out. What I wanted to highlight here is there is not one type of doctoral student that is immune to what you (OP) are currently going through. Some people are going to experience it fleetingly and others are going to experience it for longer periods of time, with everyone experiencing these feelings at different points in their doctoral journey.\n\nThis leads me to my final point, which is in some cases, you can see special characteristics of an individual (especially a doctoral student's) shine bright during these negative bouts that you would perhaps never see just talking to them. It's because these character traits are well beyond just surface level and can't be simply quantified. These characteristics can only be displayed and seen in special circumstances. It's only in times of extreme duress, stress, struggle, adversity, and depression that you see the true measure of a person's will, mental fortitude, determination, and ability to not mentally crack. For me, it was wasting 3.5 years of my doctoral eligibility on my chapter 2 (year 5.5 of a 7-year maximum doctoral program) and just wallowing in my own self-pity, despair, defeat, and depression. During this time, I became real resentful toward even my cohort mates when I heard they had passed their 3-chapter defense, compressive dissertation defense, or were making positive progress on their dissertation. These were people I loved, cared about, had supported me, I considered friends, and had busted their ass to get to their respective stages in the dissertation process. Seeing the type of person I had become truly scared me and I had to have that self-reflection and self-chat moment. I had to tell myself no more, to get my head out of my ass, and answer this simple question posed to myself, \"are you going to curl up in a ball and be swallowed up by this depression or respond and finish what you started?\" After that day, I wrote my chapter 1, 2, and 3 in 5-6 months and successfully passed my 3-chapter defense. I'll be defending my comprehensive dissertation hopefully in the early fall in year 7 of my doctorate program. Took longer than I could have ever imagined, but I finally see light at the end of this tunnel.\n\nWhen I look back at this difficult time in my doctoral journey, I just shake my head and ask myself \"what the hell was I doing?\" Yet, funny enough, I wouldn't change my doctoral experience for the world because I gained something truly valuable from this experience. It was a realization of just how truly mentally strong I was and how I would respond in the face of adversity. It's one thing to say you are strong mentally and then another thing entirely to actually showcase that trait in the face of adversity. When it comes to you OP, what you're feeling is nothing out of the ordinary and as graduate students, we all experience it and have been in your shoes in one way or another. The question is how are you going to respond to your own imposter syndrome, self-doubt, and questions of whether you can see this doctoral program out or not? Only you know the answer. But good luck OP, you got this!\n\n**PS**\\-Something that may help you or put your mind at ease in regards to your imposter syndrome is something I said in another doctoral student thread, which was: I can tell you right now, there is never any good that comes from comparing yourself or your work to that of others, including your classmates or other students at various different points in your program. **Firstly**, at the doctoral level, you're expected to get an \"A\" grade. As long as your pass the course and your professor considers your work good enough to pass their course, who cares whether someone's writing ability, research ability, or vast knowledge in a respective subject is better than yours? **Secondly**, in a lot of instances, unless you ask or get to know them, you don't know people's educational or work-related background. I have a friend of mine in the same doctoral program as me, but came to the program 2-years after me (2 cohorts after me). Even though I was working on my dissertation (and was done with coursework) when she started her first year (first semester) of coursework, her writing and knowledge of teaching was vastly superior to mine (like not even in the same galaxy). This was because she had taught abroad for 20-years and she had published close to 50 or so articles before coming into the program. I'm not sure about your doctoral program, but even in my own cohort, the age range is anywhere from 25-46, with me right in the middle at 34. While we are all at the same or similar stages within a doctoral program, each respective cohort/classmate brings different levels of teaching experience, knowledge, and expertise into the classroom. This also means that they may be at a different stage in their journey in life in regards to research paper writing or teaching compared to you, which is perfectly fine and nothing to be ashamed of. **Thirdly**, if you were admitted by your department chair, let alone survived your 2-years worth of doctoral coursework, it certainly shows that the promise and potential your chair and professors saw in your application has come to fruition and they were right to have admitted you. I don't understand why you would doubt your own skills or abilities. **Lastly**, in regards to your poster presentation at the conference you'll be attending, good luck and you'll be fine. Keep in mind that you will be attending this conference with potentially other academic nerds (I say that lovingly) who potentially have vastly more experience than you and have been giving poster and oral presentations at conferences for years/decades. Thus, stop comparing yourself to other academics. In my experience, most doctoral students are understanding, are merely interested in your study/topic, and want to network.
