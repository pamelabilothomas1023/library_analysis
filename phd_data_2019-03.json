I recommend pre-emptively accepting the South Florida offer, and telling the UMBC admissions committee that you have accepted another offer. This is common practice in the admissions process - you don't actually have to wait around to hear back from UMBC!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/aw81za/family_is_strong_influencing_choice_of_phd_program/ehkxfu8/"}, "52": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sadgrad2", "Date": 1551476308, "Score": 1, "Body": "I should add that the travel award came from the conference organizers, not my department.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/awa0um/should_this_go_on_my_cv/ehl173g/"}, "53": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "KeenGraduate", "Date": 1551477073, "Score": 3, "Body": "I would look into the culture of the institution.

Does this mean South Florida is not offering you funding (tuition waiver, stipend)? If they are not, I cannot emphasize this enough, do not go there! Do not go anywhere you are not getting paid to go. Do not take on any debt to get your PhD!\u00a0\n\n\nSecond, I would caution you against picking a school based on perceived excitement/enthusiasm to have you attend. Any school that accepts you is is enthusiastic about you attending. PhDs are competitive. You wouldn't get an offer if they didn't really want you. I wouldn't read anything into having not heard back from UMBC yet. Different schools have different admissions timelines, and I really don't think hearing back sooner from one really means anything at all.\u00a0\n\n\nThird, if you have access to childcare from your family if you attended UMBC (not sure if it's too far for this to be an option or not), I would consider that a huge plus. Getting a PhD is really stressful, and anything that relieves some of that stress is great. Unless you think the unhealthy dynamic will continue.\n\n\nThat all being said, your family isn't really treating you fairly. This isn't super healthy behavior.

R is a purpose-built language for doing these kinds of tasks, and you'll find that it takes less code to import data and do simple (or complex) statistics work in R, as compared to Python. Conversely, if you're using R, and decide you need to use it for something it's *not* built for, the code will likely be much longer and clunkier, than had you written it in Python.\n\nAt the end of the day, the choice of programming language may not be yours to make. You might walk into a lab with your freshly minted Python knowledge, only to find that they do everything with R (or something completely different). Some PIs are fairly hands-off about this, while others are adamant that all the work be done with a specific system. Thankfully, learning a second programming language is usually much easier, because the concepts don't change drastically, just the syntax.\n\nWith that in mind, Python is always a good place to start, because it is a very general language, with a good implementation of many of the core programming concepts. When you're becoming conversant with Python, download a copy of R, and mess around with it (just try a simple tutorial). Maybe try the same with Julia or Matlab (if your school gives you a free license). I know it's generally good to focus your efforts, but the opportunity cost is very low to try these other languages (all free except for Matlab). What you gain is a broader picture of the similarities and differences between the languages: this will help you if you need to branch out into a different language, and it will also help you become a better programmer in your \"main\" language.\n\nAlso, do not let it frustrate you that so much of intro programming seems to result in projects that read and write text to a terminal window. While it may not immediately seem that way, very much of scientific computing involves passing strings of text around. Need to communicate with a GC/MS or other instrument? It probably has a USB or GPIB port, and a manual with a bunch of commands that it will listen for. Need to generate a spreadsheet file? It's just a bunch of numbers separated by commas and line-breaks (for .CSV at least).

I remember that there was once a paper from our group (I was not involved), which went through 2 rounds of R&amp;R in the highest impact journal in our field, then it got rejected. In the end, it got rejected from 2 or 3 other journals and in the end, after 2 or 3 years, a mid-level journal published it. It took a lot if effort, If you are on tenure track, then this is quite a delicate bet, because you put a lot of your resources on this one paper, which you could potentially spend on other papers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, my general experience: If you have a high quality data set, you are connected with the right crowd and you took enough time to get the paper ready, then you have decent chances. You probably will not succeed with the first journal, but you will succeed with the second or third. Just try to think about journal submissions like friendly reviews aimed for making the paper stronger. Accidentally, it may end up published :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn our field it is common to decide early on where to send. This is important, because the paper structure must suit to the journal (name and length of sections, etc.), it impacts whom you cite, and ultimately, you want to find out how to best address your editor (in case you can select the editor). It goes even this far that some people would change the language from American to British english, if the journal they send to is American or European. IMO: I think this is over the top. What I think is important: If the editor holds your paper in the hand, it must appear as if he already read such a paper (ito style, layout, etc.). This is the actual hurdle you need to jump to shape a paper to fit to a journal.

The lab rotations can be done in any institute - we've got people working in Crick, ICR (Chelsea and Sutton), South Kensington, UCL, Charing Cross Hospital... I'll partially work in Oxford, for example ;) Many people choose those because of the location. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Internships\n\nAny internships, but summer are the easiest to get and manage! Don't rely on the advertised programmes, try to reach the researchers individually, there's still time! I found my internship between 2nd/3rd year of uni 1.5 months before it started... and it was funded! (but that was an unicorn really). As you said, don't  narrow your search down to cancer bio only - any lab experience will be of value (mine was in myotonic dystrophy). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;PhD positions \n\nThis is complicated and can be done in many ways. All the differences get down to how the PhD is being funded. \n\nIf it's a stipend/bigger funding programme (like the ICR, Crick, MRC-DTPs etc.) - you usually apply for the programme where the specific projects are advertised, and sometimes you are not even required to contact the PI prior to application. It's always good to make contact though, so you become a bit familiar for them during the application process. \n\nSometimes though, the PIs have their own funding, and will eventually look for students on portals like findaphd or uni website. These are the ones that if you approach them directly, you may get the position before it even gets advertised. \n\nMy application was a mix of both - I contacted an individual PI and applied for a departmental stipend (wider programme). I didn't get shortlisted for that, but the PI still wants me to join the group and he will use his own fundings for that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW - don't ask them to 'make you their student' ;) What I always did (if the position wasn't advertised) was to say that I'm interested in their research because of xyz, I'm looking for PhDs in this area and if they are planning on recruiting any new phd students. It always yielded in some responses - some don't have funding/have too many students, but some were genuinely interested and encouraged to apply for a stipend. I also had a couple of informal intwerviews with people with grants.

I have a niche doing hard to place IT positions now because I kept running into employers who were tired of getting resumes that didn't match the open position.  \n\nMost recruiters look for keywords and look how recent some of the keywords were used.  They may not see academia as experience because most have limited undergrad experience and are little more than HR people.  The higher the skill required for a job, the less likely a general recruiter will be able to find a suitable candidate.  Sure, entry level positions are easy, but since they don't know how differentiate various skills, they are less likely to recognize what skills can be substituted for the keywords.  \n\nI my case I am usually ecstatic to see a PhD candidate.  I have one myself and I love talking shop with candidates.  But beyond that, people with doctorates usually have skills that can be substituted in the job and quickly pick up the keyword skills.   But you need to have a background in the area to be able to see that, so these candidates will often be passed by because they didn't score enough hits in keywords.\n\nDoctorates also tend to organize their resume differently.  They tend to focus on research results rather than the skills needed to do that research.  Again, a missed opportunity to fill in those almighty keywords.  If you are looking outside academia, make sure you list skills and programs you have used somewhere.  It is even better if you relate those skills to a particular project.  You should also list research projects similar to positions within the same company.  This helps equate projects=experience in the mind of the recruiter or HR.\n\nI don't think that recruiters and HR don't see academia as experience as much as recruiters and HR scan hundreds of resumes, and if they can't readily see what they are looking for the resume gets passed over.  You can greatly increase your chances by making your resume look more like an industry resume than a CV.  And keywords are important.  Fluff it up by having a section that lists the tools you have used.  If you used R, I want to see R listed someplace.  If you managed grad students, I want to see a line about your management experience.  These help me sell you to the hiring company and are the only way less specialized recruiters and HR people will stop and read your resume.\n\nAnd yes, who you know matters.

I wake up everyday thinking whether I am smart enough to do this shit or not. It's been almost 6 months and I'm still struggling. There is so much to learn. Got like 8 post graduate courses to do, taking over first year students' tutorial session, research and study about your project, colloquiums, conferences, talks, seminars. I don't know why they even picked me. I talk to my cohorts and they are all so fucking smart. One of they built a small scale dark matter detector as a proof of concept for their masters and is now being nominated for some award. Another colleague literally lives and breathes physics. He listens to no music, plays no games, watches no TV, not browses internet. He carries and 2008 flip phone and constantly studies physics. And then there is me, nothing to show for, always struggling in lectures, just learning how to code, etc. I get anxiety attacks the day before my weekly supervisor meeting which means I can't fall asleep and as a result, I'm half asleep during my meeting trying to explain why the thing I thought would work last week in fact, didn't work. I dunno if I can pass this year but I am trying my best to hang on to it. I'm just hoping that this shit storm will soon die down and I will be able to enjoy my PhD. That line about how you feel slow and retarded, that's me as well. Looks like we are on the same boat. There isn't a useful advice I can give you. All I can say is, trust in the fact that your interviewers/supervisor must have seen something in you which made them choose you. Even if you don't know what that something is, just hold on to the fact that it's there. That's all I've been doing. That, and trying to stay afloat.

I had to re-teach myself intro chemistry before teaching it, because I'd forgotten so much. The good news is that it's much faster to learn the second time around, so you'll catch up quickly.\n\nSecond, having a bunch of things to learn is a perfectly normal part of any research process, let alone a PhD. You'll probably start a few different projects in your time, and each one will require reading into the background in-depth. As an example, during grad school I had to learn about dye-sensitized solar cells, conductive polymers, MOFs... and each new project meant learning a whole new set of tools, norms, etc.\n\nBecause of this, I'd say that learning how to learn is the number one most important skill you can pick up. Find whatever strategy works for you, but it is vital that you can quickly investigate any subject or field, extract useful information, familiarize yourself with the norms, and use it to come up with new ideas. In particular, I'd say the most important thing to picking up a new field quickly is establishing a strong knowledge base.\n\nMy strategy is to start at the broadest reviews I can find, then work my way in with specificity. Then I start at the oldest papers I can find, and move my way towards new. Along the way, if there's a particular concept I don't understand I'll look up the basics on Wikipedia or something similar. Let's use an example of a high-voltage lithium ion battery.\n\n1. Review paper on batteries to learn the basics if I don't know them. As I go, look up concepts like coulombic efficiency, impedance spectroscopy, etc.\n2. Review paper on lithium ion batteries to focus. Look up new concepts like SEI, half-cells, etc.\n3. Review paper(s) on high voltage lithium ion batteries. Look up new concepts like each different cathode material and solvent. If there are more specific reviews (like, a review on polymeric cathodes for high-voltage applications) I'll read those too.\n4. Now that I'm familiar with the general field, I can dig into the specific state of the art. I start with the oldest, highest-cited papers I can find. Why? Because a lot of the research will use these as references, and the first people to do something often explain their reasoning in depth, which helps me learn a lot of what the researchers take for granted.\n5. Move up through time, finding more recent, highly cited papers. Again, these are common references, and each new major step forward spawns new lines of research.\n6. Once I'm at the current day, I can start keeping up the latest studies by regularly surveying relevant journals. Again, if something new comes up I can look up the basics to make sure I really understand it.\n\nHopefully this helps.\n\n**EDIT:** Oh yeah, and feeling completely inadequate is also really normal. As you learn more about any field, you'll slowly start to realize how little you *really* know. With time, you'll learn that **everybody** feels that way, and most people just try to hide it. The best researchers I know are the ones that are completely unafraid to look dumb by asking basic questions, because they've long accepted that they don't know much.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/b2inug/pick_up_new_material_on_phd_some_advice_needed/eith6hn/"}, "854": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "hknd23", "Date": 1552932787, "Score": 1, "Body": "You forgot the wacky happy hours ", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/b2kypq/conference_survival_guide_ir_specific_but/eithec3/"}, "855": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "chopperdave48", "Date": 1552932903, "Score": 1, "Body": "what you're feeling is very very normal.

I will provide my opinion on your questions in order:\n\n**Point 1.** If the editor has rejected the paper, move on, but use their comments as advice on where your paper might be improved. *Be open to this.* I know that everyone puts a bit of themselves into their manuscripts, but reviewers are not judging you, they are reviewing your work. Very few manuscripts get published without at least minor revisions. \n\nIf the editor has rejected your paper based on journal fit, I would not consider this to be a quality issue. To control for this, if I am concerned that the manuscript may not be a good fit for the journal, I try to contact the editor of the next journal before submitting. I generally ask if it is okay to send them my abstract to gain insight on whether the paper may be a good fit for the journal. I have had mixed outcomes on this - most were happy to accommodate, some were not open to reviewing the abstract. \n\n**Point 2.** I have had desk rejects, and rejects after the paper has gone out for review. I generally read the e-mail, but then do not address the rejection for a couple of days until I have a clearer head. Then I do the following:\n\nReview all comments in depth, and critically. Most reviewers are not paid, and it is really generous for reviewers to give their time.  In most cases, I give the benefit of the doubt that someone has taken the time to offer advice/comments that will improve the quality of the manuscript. \n\nSo then I start to look at the comments, and identify which of them:\n\n1. Are feasible to do\n\n2. Will improve the quality of the manuscript\n\nExamples of this may be that reviewers/editors have pointed out they key pieces of literature are missing from the introduction/lit review, clarification of methodology, better linking the discussion to the results, the novel findings of the paper need to be more refined/stated more clearly.\n\nReviewers may also point out typos that they have picked up. These obviously are not critical changes to the manuscript, but corrections should be made to ensure that your manuscript looks professional. I have had this happen once or twice - it happens, sometimes a fresh pair of eyes will identify these things and it helps.\n\nSometimes reviewers will have comments which you just can not do, for example for whatever reason you simply can not collect more data, collect data using different methods than described in the paper, or re-analyze the data in a way to answer your research question differently. I generally do not try to change the manuscript to meet these comments, but may note them down for consideration in future projects.\n\nReviewers may also offer interesting insights into the paper, but they do not actually improve the manuscript. I also ignore these, and note for the future.\n\nI also ignore comments that are rude. Thankfully with platforms like Publons reviewers' comments are becoming more transparent, but occasionally you get a very nasty comment in the mix that doesn't even warrant your attention. For example, a lab mate of mine once had a very nasty comment which implied that the lead author was stupid for using British spelling instead of American, when the journal had not specified a preference for the language/terminology used. *These comments should just be straight up ignored.*\n\n**Point 3.** As above. If the paper can not be improved by any reviewer/editor comments, then keep it in the original form - however chances are that you will find comments that will improve the paper from rejections.\n\n**Point 4.** Do not dunk the paper, it will get published somewhere. When preparing a paper, I always create a list of ten or so journals where the journal may fit, and rank them on their impact factor, publishing fees and other things like word count, acceptance rates and rough review time which may come into play. Remember that you are adding to the field with your knowledge - I would really doubt that research produced by a PhD candidate under the guidance of qualified supervisors would not be worthy of being published. You have done all the hard work - now it's just a waiting game.\n\nA final note: yes, this process can be very demoralizing. However, try not to take the feedback personally. I'm sure your work is worthy of being published. \n\nCheers!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/b2rrnm/quick_question_about_rejections_from_journals/eiv082c/"}, "878": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "aritra91", "Date": 1552986465, "Score": 13, "Body": "Of course you are not a failure !!!

Endnote, Mendeley, and Zotero I'd say are the top three, but use what works for you. The most important thing a reference manager does for me (outside of making a bibliography) is allow me to find that one paper I remember reading so I can get the details. Each of these lets you store PDFs and references in an organized fashion, so every paper can be put where it belongs. For example, each project you're working on can have a folder, divided into subfolders for particular subjects (\"General Concepts,\" \"Synthesis,\" \"Similar Compounds\"). You can also search by keyword, so I can find all the papers with the word \"vinylpyridine.\"\n\nI don't take too many notes any more. These days my \"notes\" consist of a small blip in the \"keywords\" section of the reference to help me remember why I saved this paper in the first place, or a blurb in the notes section reminding me to look at the voltage range. However, Endnote and Mendeley allow you to save the PDF and mark it up as you please, and those will sync between devices (I'm not sure about Zotero). Highlight important passages, add a comment that the compound looks very similar to yours, or whatever else you want to remember. But it's important to know that everybody has their own system: some researchers can't stand electronic notes, so they still print out the papers and mark them up by hand, just using Endnote to organize them.

Like lots of jobs, the hours can balloon from time to time.\n\nThe environment is a real appeal. You're surrounded by a lot of really smart people doing really interesting things.

There has been and continues to be a huge mental cost to doing a PhD for me. While technically speaking your time is more 'free', most of the graduate students I have known feel like they're never spending enough time on their thesis. So while you might have more free time (or more flexibility around when your free time happens), none of it is guilt-free. I have had to set boundaries on this, due to mental and physical health limitations, but I still blame myself for not putting in enough time and effort.   \n\n\nPhDs in most science fields are extremely self driven, the bulk of the work being the thesis itself. Your supervisor will not be trained in supervising grad students, and may or may not have good supervisory skills. There are few deadlines/milestones at my institution, so it is very challenging to mark progress. For ecology or forestry work, there will likely be phases and milestones you pass that may help with this, though (my work is in a cell biology lab where experiments can be repeated infinitely and there are almost always ways to tweak an experiment to try and get it to work, more similar to the analysis phase of ecological work).  \n\n\nAll this being said, I have always loved studying the world, and this stressful environment is a place where I get to do that with relative freedom. I am in the phase of my PhD where I forget how wonderful that is, and instead I just feel ill to think about my road to completion. The day-to-day work is interesting, takes advantage of my strengths and pushes me to reassess my own scientific method all the time. And I have learned SO MANY skills while doing this, so even though I think sometimes about abandoning the PhD without completing my thesis, I know that I will take a lot away from the process up to this point.  \n\n\nSorry for going on a bit here (and mostly negatively), but I wanted to give you a snapshot of the hidden costs that my PhD has had for me.

Are you starting a company based on some new technology? Are you teaching? Are you a private consultant? Are you a freelancer working from home? Are you a researcher working in a lab? Are you going full mountain man living in seclusion from society?\n\nYou're very likely to be in the first position without a graduate degree (Masters or PhD) but the possibilities open up dramatically (as does your mind) once you add a little grad school to the mix. You will learn to take on tasks deemed by society as impossible and you will show the world that it is possible.   It's awesome that the topic is something you are excited about, that will help a lot.  But even still if you get bored of your work,a PhD buys you expertise in any field you are so inclined to explore.  It buys you the credibility to just say \"I have studied ___ \" \n\nFor example - my brother got his PhD in Electrical engineering, read a couple of books on biochem and genetics and now he's doing crispr research as a post doc.\n\nI'm doing my PhD now, watching all of my friends from undergrad struggle to justify waking up every morning to go to work, and seeing the success of my mentors who have since graduated.

Does it require a PhD? If the answer is no, don't do it.\n\nA PhD is a time commitment of many years, which are generally regarded as extremely strenuous. Little free time, less money, and this overarching stress of trying to scrape together enough results to make a worthwhile thesis. And if you don't love doing the research (not just the project) you will hate your life the whole time.\n\nIn exchange, what do you get? Maybe higher pay (although that is debatable), and the opportunity to work on interesting problems, if that's what you want to do. Since you've spent many years specializing, it's *really* hard to get a generalist's job again, so your job options shrink rather than expand. You've sacrificed several years of income, which you may or may not make back. And you have to put life off for a little while.\n\nI would strongly recommend getting a job first. In the US at least, it's pretty easy to come back to a PhD once you have some experience, and at that point you'll have solidified what you want to do.

The only addition was that I hated academia then. I understand it a little better now but I am still uncomfortable in the company of academics.\n\nI am in my fourth year of PhD - Public Policy and Administration in a decent - mid level school in the US. I have no intention of staying in the academia. I don't fancy being a professor for three reasons - 1. I don't think I will be a good one. 2. Living in Europe or USA would always mean that I am a 2nd class citizen (well I am still going to be the same in India but can't help that) 3. If I go back to India, I won't make money. I give you the reasons because unlike most scholars, I do not believe that a PhD should be done only if you are intent on staying in academia. PhD is a lot more than a foot in the door in academia. It is rigorous training in research, it is an opportunity to get a varied exposure and introduce new skill sets to your repertoire.   \n\nAll of us have different experiences and approaches to handling a PhD and by extension the academia. I did my masters in social work in India and during that time I realized that I was more interested in policy analysis. I also figured out that I really liked quantitative research and data analysis in general. So when I accepted my PhD opportunity, I was already clear that I don't want an academic job or to be more specific - I don't want to teach. That has not stopped me from doing well in my courses or defending my proposal.   \n\nWhat does cause a problem is the way forward. Most students in my cohort are clear. They know that they need to publish and keep applying to openings for professors or post-docs. I am in grey area now. I need to publish, complete my dissertation and find way of jumping into development sector job market while trying to upskill. That transition from a PhD to the non-academic job market is not easy. It's not even easy to make it to a post-doc position in a really good school. I generally find myself clueless while making this transition. This transition is easier if you are in economics or natural sciences but for my case it has been difficult.   \n\nThat being said - I wouldn't change a thing about how I have structured my education. Indian social science cannot deal with numbers. The hegemony of quantitative social sciences in the US is replicated by  qualitative researchers in the Indian social science scenario. The little work that does come out is done by engineers and statisticians. I hope to find some scope of work there or maybe in Europe or South America. In that context being able to use basic econometrics or code will be important and I learned all those only through my PhD. I wouldn't get an opportunity to do the same in India because no institution would allow me in without a statistics or economics degree as an undergrad.   \n\nIt's difficult to say either/or in this case. I just listed things I thought about. Maybe it will help put your thoughts in line when you make your decision. \n\nAnd yes, Congratulations!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/b5poe0/should_i_do_a_phd/ejf3ge8/"}, "1154": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "frogdude2004", "Date": 1553611027, "Score": 8, "Body": "And passion for research, not necessarily academia.
