A lot of the academics in my cohort have a \"better-than-everyone\" attitude and don't really take advice from anyone, even fellow males at the same level of their career. Also, a lot of people don't think that someone outside of their immediate field can offer any insight into their topic, because they're the expert. So I think in the majority of cases, it's just an egotistical academic thing rather than a sexist academic thing.\n\nThat being said, if you're seeing someone who routinely asks for your advice, and then routinely dismisses it while readily taking advice from other males - then that is certainly worth raising with them. It doesn't need to be accusatory. Just ask why they value the advice of \\*insert colleague's name here\\* but haven't taken on board any of the suggestions you've made. Even if they get a little defensive, odds are they'll actually think about it and they might realise that they've been unfairly biased. \n\nI think it's also fair to decline to offer your advice.

But for more than that I think the quality of PhD is pretty good in Europe as well while the quality of EU PhD life is way way better.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/b95fab/phd_in_us_vs_uk_tried_both_here_my_2_cents/ek33hd6/"}, "134": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "J-Jazz", "Date": 1554361567, "Score": 7, "Body": "Do they teach you how to conduct research with n=1 in the US?

I would recommend applying to places where there is more than one person you would be excited to work with, but this is not always possible.\n\nNext, I would talk to advisors/mentors in your Master's program about your intention to apply for PhDs. Give them a picture of why you want to do a PhD, and what kind of work you would be interested in. Talk to them about some of that literature you just read.\n\nYour advisor may know one or more of these people through their network, and may connect you to them. I wouldn't have the guts to ask a professor to do this for me, but when I was having these conversations, multiple professors offered to do this without my asking.\n\nYou can also ask mentors about reaching out to faculty without an introduction. Some fields this is ok, some fields it is not. It also varies from professor to professor.

This shouldn't be normal,  but unfortunately it is. Am Not sure if this helps you or not, but just know you are not alone in thinking this way.\n\nIt got a lot better for me after the first year.  I reflected on what was making me unhappy and made peace with the things I couldn't change (primarily my supervisors attitudes). I think a lot of people walk into PhDs with expectations that the experience is going to be or look a certain way. In my case I did an honors project in a happy lab of people with weekly meetings, lots of support and an engaged supervisor. I expected the same with my PhD, However when I started i was the ONLY person working in my lab, my primary supervisor, at that point was disinterested in my project and trying to drag a meeting out of them was impossible. It was horrible. \n\n I was lucky to have share an office with others doing a PhD although on very different topics. Quickly realised every PhD has it's own.unique set of problems. Where I couldn't get my supervisors to meet with me, one of my friends had almost daily meetings forced in her that took hours and nothing was ever decided. I realised my PhD had certain positives afterall - basically my supervisors let me plan my project and do what I wanted.  That changed my mindset.\n\n\nHowever if you are really desperately unhappy don't let what I've said stop you from quitting if that's what you think you need to do. I know someone who quit in their second year, got a great job, and Is super happy.

I find you can't maximize all three simultaneously. \n\n1. **Note-taking**. Is it easy to take notes? Are there lots of capabilities, like doodles, tables, tagging, etc.?\n\n2. **Note-retrieval**. Can you find the idea that you wrote that one time about that one person? \n\n3. **Futureproofing and portability**. If you're in academia long-term, you may be looking at these notes in ten years. Evernote was launched about 10 years ago. Will they be around 10 more? Even if they are around, you can't even open a Word document from the 90s on a current version of Word. Will you have to pay a subscription for the rest of your life to look at your notes?\n\n## Different notes for different folks\n\n**pen and paper pad:** In my opinion, this is the absolute best for (1) notetaking. Research suggests that writing long hand is also better for memory. You can draw, use arrows, draw tables, etc. It's also decent for (3). You can dust it off a decade from now and still read it. I used pen and paper for years, but I stopped because I find it terrible for (2). If it's a recent note, retrieving info is fine, but what about that one reference you jotted down from a year ago? Or was it two? What if you want to see all the notes on a similar topic side by side quickly?\n\n**iA Writer and plain text files:** I use markdown and plain text files for almost all my ideas and notes. Plain text from the 70s can be opened even today, so in terms of (3), this is as futureproof as it gets. The app I use to write and organize is iA Writer, which I very highly recommend. There's an excellent desktop app and a mobile app that syncs with a few different cloud services. Also, no subscription fee! If you ever uninstall it, no information is lost. The files are totally non-proprietary.\n\nThere's a hashtag system to allow you to easily find different things you've written. For example, I organize all notes in folders by month and year, but then I use hashtags throughout like #conference or #readinglist. There's a list of hashtags on the left, and when I click on one it'll show me all the items with those hashtags in date order. So it's also excellent at (2), note retrieval.\n\nI stay away from apps like Bear, Evernote, Ulysses, Notability or Google Keep even though most of these can be a bit better at (1). I'm willing to give up some fancy features in order to have control over my notes. The idea of paying a subscription to maintain my note-taking workflow feels wrong to me.

If you like doing research and writing it up, a PhD is a good choice. If you want to be a world-class expert in something, a PhD is a good choice. If you want to work in academia, a PhD is a good choice. If money (both short term and long term) is not a primary motivator, a PhD is a good choice. Generally, a PhD will not really help your career much because the time spent getting it could have been spent getting more industry experience. But it *may* get you into more specialised, research-oriented positions, which it sounds like you would enjoy. You might find yourself in slightly higher paying positions afterwards, but over your lifetime, you will probably amass more wealth if you put the excess income from working full time for those years, instead of doing a PhD, into a high interest savings account, and use your additional work experience to get you more senior positions.\n\nThe main other reason I can think of to do a PhD is if getting the qualification itself would be a greatly rewarding personal experience. For most people, all the other factors are far more important. I really felt good about getting my PhD, and my self-esteem went through the roof...for about a week. It's a fairly short-lived feeling (or it was for me), and while any time I reflect on it, it feels good to have it under my belt, I probably don't feel much different to how I would if I never got it, so I would urge people to only put a *little* weight on this factor when putting all the pros and cons together. \n\nAnother related reason is avoiding regret.

TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems.TeX is popular in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science, economics, engineering, linguistics, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology. It has largely displaced Unix troff, the other favored formatting system, in many Unix installations, which use both for different purposes.

When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG (\"what you see is what you get\") word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references.

They'll be talking about a different aspect of your topic, or using tools and methods that you're not familiar with, sometimes drawn from fields that are otherwise unrelated. So when you read it, you need to go over it multiple times, and look up definitions and things like that. Sometimes I start reading a paper and end up going down a rabbit hole of learning a whole field of mathematics I was unfamiliar with. This often happens before even making it through the introduction, and makes the paper sound super high level. Then you go to write your own paper, and it's a topic that you've been fully immersed in for years, and you know every single detail of what you're writing about. So you write it and think \"this doesn't sound anywhere *near* as sophisticated as the papers I read\". This gives you the instinct to explain less rather than more, but it's likely to be unintelligible to the reader. Things that are obvious to you as *the* world expert on your specific specialisation are not going to be so obvious to other people, even if they are experts in the same broad discipline, and they've been working on it for decades. Every paper sounds much lower level to the author than to literally everyone else, so you need to compensate for this. The introduction will sound like the lightest of light reading to you, and then it will slowly deepen toward the end of the introduction (or the start of the next section), until it gets to a level where you can really say the things you are wanting to say. \n\nIt also depends on your intended audience. Say you're writing a paper about, for example, a new ultrasound technique for finding dinosaur bones. If you're equally knowledgeable about acoustics and archaeology, it's going to make a massive difference whether you're publishing in an archaeology journal or an acoustics journal. If you publish in an archaeology journal, you're *really* going to feel like the way you're writing the physics aspects is written for people with intellectual disabilities. I don't think there's any way to really read your work from another person's perspective, so the only solution is to be aware of this bias and compensate for it. Of course, it's *possible* to overcompensate and end up with something that really *does* treat the reader like an idiot, but I don't think I've actually seen this happen, and the norm is for people to undercompensate.\n\njust my 2c", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bcg6p5/how_to_write_a_scientific_article/ekr0cq9/"}, "608": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "GoodbyeEarl", "Date": 1555104025, "Score": 3, "Body": "I personally err on the side of caution, and I'm probably projecting in this comment but....

That was almost a decade ago. I'm conducting my research right now.  In a lot of ways it never really goes away.  Imposter Syndrome. There's a lot of advice on how to handle it, and there's a lot of great stuff right here in this thread. \n\nI just want to add on a little and speak from my own experiences. \n\nI've got a brain in my head.  I'm not bragging.  I'm betting that--all things being equal--you're pretty smart yourself. Most people in doctoral programs are probably pretty smart, and look, I'll be the first one to admit \"smart\" is a broad term, there are different ways of being smart, intellect can be reflected in a variety of ways, and there's more to being in a doctoral program than just being smart.  I get that.\n\nOkay, so I've got a brain in my head.  I typically do well in school.  Starting my PhD program was a bit of a wakeup call. \n\n\"Everything that's worked well for you in the past through your entire lifetime of education? Yeah, that's not going to be good enough anymore.\"\n\nA lot of what worked in the past won't be good enough anymore, and sometimes you'll have people tell you that in no uncertain terms. That isn't always easy to hear.\n\nAlso, in my experience, you're going to have to get used to hearing a lot of people tell you \"no\" or \"not good enough \" if you get a reply at all.\n\nYour advisor won't get back to you. Your research question will need to be reconceptualized.  The IRB will make you revise fundamental aspects of your research again and again after you've worked long hours on it already. Once you get your research approved, you'll have trouble recruiting. Institutions won't return your calls, your emails will be ignored, and after they finally agree to help you recruit participants nobody will want to participate. You'll be forced to--once again--reconceptualize something you're passionate about, something that you spent hours researching, and go back to your advisor and the IRB again. \n\nIt can be a lot, and it can make you feel like a fraud, like you're just pretending,  like you aren't up to the task. \n\nThe important thing is that you learn from these experiences.  Those papers I wrote in the beginning *weren't* up to the level that a doctoral program requires.  The IRB needed to reject my application because it wasn't good enough. My research question was too broad.  I needed to rise to the occasion. Of course it hurt not getting participants, but I learned to  recognize that I knew my research from a variety of different angles. If I needed to reconceptualize? I could do that. \n\nThese feelings are normal, and at times you might be faced with situations that validate those thoughts.  You've got to adapt to those situations and rise to the occasion. \n\nI think you're up to it.\n\n\nTL,DR: These feelings are normal. Things probably will be hard.

Think of those exams like the bar exam; he has finished his coursework and now has to show that -- as you did when you finished your JD coursework (I assume; I know that not everyone takes the bar) -- he has sufficiently learned enough in his coursework to go onto the next stage.  I actually find that to be a comparison; you may find this hard to believe, but I can tell you as someone who did both: these exams are at least on par with the bar exam in terms of difficulty and the amount of preparation needed.  (I actually failed my comp exams my first time through even though I passed the bar on my first attempt)  So I'm sure you can definitely understand what he's going to be going through shortly.  He's stressed, and I'm guessing a lot of the perceived lashing out about you being supportive is him being stressed and/or you not understanding the pressure that he's under.\n\nThere is one big difference between your partner's exams and the bar: while a law student takes the bar to show that they have the legal thinking skills and practical knowledge to be an attorney, your partner is taking the exams to show that he has the proper methodological training and ability to complete a large-scale research project, aka the dissertation/thesis.  When a law school graduate passes the bar they are now an attorney; but once your partner passes his exams he moves onto the next stage, which is actually tackling that large-scale research project.\n\nSo once your partner passes his exams, he transitions to the next stage and becomes a Doctoral Candidate (as opposed to a Doctoral Student).  From this point on, he has one singular goal and focus: his dissertation/thesis.\n\nFrom this point, there are two additional stages.  Every program is a little bit different, but I can tell you my program's process and perhaps others can chime in with their own program's processes, should they differ.\n\nFirst, your partner will have to come up with a research proposal, or prospectus, that shows that he (1) understands the prior research surrounding his proposed dissertation/thesis topic and how his topic fits into that body of literature; and (2) can speak to (and has the background to accomplish) what research methods will be necessary to complete that proposed research project.\n\nOnce he shows his committee (made up of 4-5 faculty members) that he has a good research idea and has the ability to actually pull off that research, he then proceeds to working on his full dissertation.  At this point what he will be going through (and how long it will take) will entirely depend on what his project actually is.\n\nMost of my friends at this point are fellow PhD students, but I feel that the best way you can support him is just to listen to him and let him bounce ideas off of you.  While he is working on his dissertation, he will be torn between being constantly consumed with ideas that are often difficult to express and feeling like he doesn't know how to proceed.  Listen to his long rambles about his dissertation ideas, offer feedback where you are able/comfortable, and let him rant about his committee members or his writing.  To the extent he is comfortable with it, take the process with him; express interest in what he's doing and understand the gravity and breadth of what he's trying to accomplish.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/be884k/my_partner_is_getting_a_phd_how_can_i_be_more/el4qju6/"}, "827": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sadgrad2", "Date": 1555533211, "Score": 3, "Body": "Be understanding if they basically drop out of communication in the immediate lead up to comprehensive exams.

If you quit now and get a full time job, will you feel good in five years that you made a quicker start on saving for a house, and you'll be okay with not having a PhD, or will you feel like you made a rash decision and have regrets about it? If you continue, will you feel personal satisfaction with the qualification, and feel good about the opportunities it provides you, or will you regret putting yourself behind the eight ball when it comes to work experience and life savings?\n\nOf course, if you're truly depressed, this has to factor into it too, because depression can cause permanent damage in more ways than one. So I'm not saying that if you would like to have a PhD you should ignore the pain you're going through now. What I'm saying is that you should weigh *all* pros and cons in terms of their *future* impact rather than quit just because you want to stop feeling the way you are feeling right now. Getting a PhD feels interminable while you're doing it, but it's really a small fraction of your life, and when it's over it will seem like a difficult but rewarding blip in your life story. I'm not trying to persuade you that you should stay, because I have no idea whether it's the right decision for you or not, but I think it's important to look at it from a broader perspective than we are inclined to do while we're in the middle of it.\n\nAnd, as others have said, it's pretty common for PhD students to feel like they don't have enough direction, or that they aren't doing well enough. I was lucky enough to have supervisors who were incredibly encouraging and helped me to understand that it's normal. If you're not getting the same kind of support, then if you are going to stay, you need to find another way to get a better understanding of what it's like for others. Posting here is a good start, but you should really find other PhD students who you can talk to about what you're both going through in person. Have you talked to your adviser/s about how you're feeling? If you haven't, they might not realise that you're struggling. They might see a very promising PhD student who they couldn't imagine would be struggling with confidence about it, so they might not have even thought to ask you about how you're personally feeling.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bezgd8/another_post_on_quitting/elawkun/"}, "926": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "0urobrs", "Date": 1555712615, "Score": 1, "Body": "I know the feeling.

Especially in business fields since most of the lists, as you may have noticed, are for MBA programs, which does not give any indication on the quality of the doctoral programs.

The better schools will have more publications in the top journals.  Note that things could be different for DBA as the degree has a different focus.

Take a look at Google Scholar and find research that interests you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen choosing a program, at least for a PhD, research fit is key.  It could be a great school, but if nobody in the department does project management research and your statement of purpose is all about doing project management research you will likely be rejected even if you have perfect test scores and a 4.0 GPA.

So, in such a situation it is only natural to react like you did. To look for something with quick feedback and a lot of routine.

Explain that you found your PhD fulfilling and a great educational experience on a personal and professional level, and that one of the things that you learned was that you can contribute more in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ engineering/development and you enjoy it more than \"ivory-tower research\". Then leave it at that; the interviewer might dwell, but probably not: her/his time is valuable too, and will probably move on. If anything, by finishing your PhD in spite of wanting to do something else shows that you are willing to stick with commitments in spite of personal displeasure.  \n\n\nYou've got this!

I can't relate directly, but I have faced situations where I've had to justify 'gaps' in my resume (my first job was at 18 because I had a lot more household responsibilities than the average teenager, and employers always asked about it). \n\nThe advice I would give is to make sure your resume targets the company you're applying for. This doesn't mean completely changing your resume, it just means having an 'objectives' section at the top that's a short 1-2 sentences on why you want to work there and what you hope to achieve with them. It's a good place to say that you're seeking a job with them after experiencing academia and deciding it's not for you. You should also have a 'skills' section or similar, and tailor those to the skills that the company is looking for.\n\nThe other huge thing is to write a cover letter. Even if the company doesn't ask for one, write one. Write a single page that addresses the person who would potentially be hiring you, introduce yourself and your education and why you want to work there, then write 1-3 short paragraphs outlining relevant experience that you have. This includes your PhD. Talk about it, and talk about how it was a rewarding experience but it made you realise that you would prefer a career outside of academia. Talk about the project management skills, the communication skills, all of those great things that you do learn during a PhD. I've gotten engineering jobs by writing cover letters that discuss my experience in marketing because it shows that I can communicate effectively, which is sorely lacking with a lot of people in my field. It's not about whether the experience is directly relevant, it's about showing that you've taken away relevant skills.\n\nI've heard of people leaving their PhDs out of their resume. I don't think you should do that. I don't think anyone should leave out any major work experience or education that they've done. It's all about the art of presenting it in such a way that it suits the company you're applying for. Draw on the skills that you've learnt that matter to the company, and focus on those.\n\nGood luck, I hope that you find a job that makes you happier than academia has!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bge0zq/i_kind_of_dont_want_a_career/ellq5ma/"}, "1091": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Elesday", "Date": 1556062771, "Score": 1, "Body": "When talking about \u201ctechnical help\u201d, is it about programming?

A real publication,  one that will echo, will never take less than than a few months,  often upwards of 6 to 12. The best journals have their fastest turnarounds in months.  If you feel you are still lacking, make sure you have read their journal. Format it like theirs. Sections, headers, lingo, anything that makes them feel familiar. Dont be discouraged, keep trying.

Your paid time also involves some teaching hours, and you can't make progress with your research during that time, so it usually means extra hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat reduces the stress is that the pay (I got 1200\u20ac after tax and health insurance) is usually enough so you don't have to work a side job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the other user already said, finishing in 3 years is rare. 4-5 years is more average.

I just want to start by saying that good for you for being so self aware and having an open mind when it comes to making decisions. \n\nI have about five years of corporate experience in my respective field with a masters completed in the same field about to leave my corporate role to start my PhD journey. Going to give you some perspective having had the corporate experience and I will say that it really depends on the job you take on. There are roles where you can start at 9 am and stop at 5 pm, shelve your concerns for the next day and enjoy some downtime. You can also take on roles especially as they gain in seniority that will leave you constantly anxious and dreaming of the emails you should have or didn't send. You'll deal with difficult supervisors or internal and external people from all walks of life amd you won't be able to just avoid them. I think I am like you, anxious alot, in a sort of constant state of concern and stress and I will say that both school and work so far have affected my anxieties in their own ways.\n\nI chose to leave corporate because it isn't for me not because of how it impacts my mental health but because of how much I love research, learning, teaching and the topics that I'm invested in pursuing. I just don't see myself growing in corporate they way I would. But that's the poison I've picked because I know just how detrimental it may be to my mental health. But I prefer to do something I enjoy. And I think that's a question you should also ask as well. Which will you enjoy more? Because your anxiety will be there but it's ultimately what will feel better for you at the end of the day. Because when I was stressed and anxious at my corporate job, I was resentful because it wasn't my long term and I felt robbed of my mental health in a lot of ways.\n\nI think you should definitely get some experience in corporate before you make your final decision if you can do it. It will give you wonderful perspective and you seem very self aware. So, I think that experience will help you and you can always apply again if you feel academia may be better.\n\nSorry for the long post I hope that sort of helps!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bhq1yp/letting_a_phd_offer_slip/elwnx5p/"}, "1274": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "eoinlonely", "Date": 1556370693, "Score": 9, "Body": "This...this is who I am", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bhy9f6/youre_not_alone_nice_reminder_seen_on_twitter/elwqb1q/"}, "1275": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "revinguptheautism", "Date": 1556374922, "Score": 13, "Body": "It's called imposter syndrome.

I didn't, and it became a bit of a vicious cycle of not getting anything done and then feeling extra crappy about it. The only thing that works for me when I hit one of those slumps is to take a couple of mental health days to do things that I love. I'm an introvert so for me that's reading a book I've been wanting to read, going to garden/craft/fish shops, going out for breakfast with my boyfriend, simple stuff.

When you are going downhill, you lean into it and run a little faster; uphill, you conserve that energy and slow down. \n\nCompare that to grad school: some days you'll feel hella productive. Or you'll need to get a lot done. Those are days to lean into doing a lot. On other days, you'll feel like shit and not have much on the horizon. It's OK if you don't get a full 8 hours of super productive work in. Get something done--read a chapter, write an article summary or two, whatever. \n\nEbb and flow, my friend.

It happens because when we join a PhD program, we bring a lot of framing of reference and forms of learning that take a while for us to 'crack'.

Nothing else shows your knowledge about your topic than writing and defending your PoV. And, if you are courageous enough, ask a friendly review from your cohort or even from your supervisor.
