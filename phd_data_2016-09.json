Employment decisions are more often than not based on safety, and the more you know someone, the safer they are as a choice.\n\nAlso, don't be disheartened if you don't get it (I've been here before, too, on a dream project). It is likely the PhD isn't right for you if it's a no. It'll feel soul-draining, but is a far better option than being accepted onto a project you aren't 100% capable of completing!\n\nDepending on the supervisor, or whether you're part of a Doctoral Training Program, they could be looking for a few different things. But the common advice for all seems to be\n\n1. Make sure you know why you are pursuing a PhD, and the specifics you'd like to get out of it. Is it for a career in academia, or for industry? Are you looking to get really good at teaching, programming, etc. Everyone likes someone who plans ahead in detail.\n2. Be honest. One of the most important skills you can have is to know your limitations. Always put a silver lining on any weakness you are asked about (e.g. I'm not great at teaching as I've had little experience of it and sometimes get nervous in front of large audiences, but I've done some presentations to boost my confidence over the past few years, and find the prospect of demonstrating in practical sessions exciting)\n3. Try and turn your interview into a conversation. Ask them about their research, about the parts you find most interesting.\n\nThose tips are helped me, so I hope they can at least be of a little use to yourself.

It explains the basic craft skills and ground rules of the academic world in general, and research in particular. Its focus is the vitally important things that the standard textbooks don\u2019t bother to mention on the sweet assumption that they can be left to the readers\u2019 lecturers and supervisors. \nIf you are doing a PhD or an MPhil then this book is intended to help you to do the best research possible with the minimum of wasted effort.

Their academic credentials include PhDs, publication of various journal papers and encyclopaedia articles, advanced research fellowships, a couple of journal editorships, refereeing for major journals and fund-giving bodies, and raising between them over a million pounds of research funding.

I had found an anti-depressant that worked really well for me some years ago, but I hadn't taken it in some time and wanted to get back on it. I tried everything to go through the university's student healthcare system, but to no avail. Even though the doctors at student health had prescribed one of my closest friends anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, so I had it on pretty good authority that this was a possibility, they told me definitively that that is NOT something they do, and that the only way I could get it is through counseling services. Welp, tried that, and after my intake interview they told me that it would be 6 to 8 weeks before I could get my first appointment. That's a devastatingly long time if getting through every day is a struggle. \n\nAfter a few weeks of trying to get an appointment with a local psychiatrist, I did eventually find a PCP who was willing to help. The office visits ended up costing me about $200 that I didn't have as a poor grad student on a barely-enough-to-live on stipend, but I was just so grateful that I could get any relief at all. \n\nNow that I've typed it all out, it sounds like a whole 'nother paper about institutional failures to come through on their promises when someone is trying like hell to get the help that they need, but maybe it'll still be of some use to you!

If you're really impassioned by this thing that you're sinking so many hours into, then it's possible to swallow a lot of other challenges and inconveniences for the sake of doing what you love. So maybe you're not quite at the quitting point yet?\n\nOne thing is that professors aren't necessarily experts on funding, but there may well be offices within the university (or even handy websites!) that can direct you toward scholarships and fellowships. Probably nothing that's going to pay your way by itself, but you may be able to cobble together a pretty decent financial cushion. \n\nAlso, I have advisors with whom I'm actually extremely happy, but while they always have a sense of what I'm working on, I have to fill them in again every time. I don't really mind, since I know how overworked they are themselves. At the end of the day, doctoral work really is very self-directed. I spend weeks and months doing my own thing before I pop up for air and check in with someone about my progress, but I try to be as specific as possible. I go to THEM with a sense of the kind of feedback that I want or feel I need and with some concrete questions. That might be something you can consider. They may not be with you at the big-picture level of your project, but if you're looking for more resources on some specific thing, they're likely to have something in mind. So basically, what I'm saying is that there are probably ways to take advantage of your advisors as resources by working around their limits. \n\nFinally--and most importantly!!--if you feel that you're in danger of slipping into a depressive episode, you want to make sure you have some support structures in place immediately, before you get locked in that quicksand.

It's very easy to fall into a 'slump' doing a PhD where you go in, sit on the computer and pretend to work, putting in minimal hours and only going in to show your face. This can last for years. PhDs are very self motivated and you need discipline, it's all too easy to become disenchanted and lose focus when experiments/research isn't fruitful, you have no direction, your supervisor is more of a friend than a boss who let's you do what you want or even after achieving something like a paper publication. From what you describe your SO may be feeling the same, I've been there and there is hope.\n\nI wrote my thesis from start to finish effectively in a ten week stint with a long procrastination period before hand and submitted it with only a few days before my deadline. The key is routine, I cannot emphasise this enough. Get up, go to work, have websites blocked that waste your time, work a long day, no or minimal weekends. After a week or so your SO may see there is hope that he can achieve what he needs in the time he has. To get him to do this may be difficult, I know when my partner tried to motivate me I would just become irritable and tell her she was clueless, when in reality I was going to bed every night in a panic about how far I'd let things slip. \n\nIf I found myself in his situation I would begin with a thesis plan, chapter outline etc. Write up all methods and results chapters first, leave any literature review to the end as it is easy to write about things that aren't related to your study results if you do this first. In writing up his results he will see that the studies he's done, methods he's used will have some publishable merit even if it's not obvious at the moment to him. I can almost guarantee this. Lots and lots of journal publications have papers that simply repeat results of other papers and any data that has a reasonable 'story' and is written well will be publishable. I'm sure many people on this sub reddit have come across papers that are actual nonsense and it's obvious to see data has been cherry picked or a fudge factor applied in some way or another. I'm not encouraging your SO to fabricate results but am trying to emphasise that getting a first author publication is easier than he may think when considering the lower impact factor journals. Also journals such as Nature Scientific Reports (which actually has a good and growing impact factor) will accept papers that hold water scientifically even if the impact of the data is negligible. I'm sure there are analogues journals for non science fields if he is not in science. If he really digs in and falls into a routine finishing in 8 months is very achievable using the the work he has done, he must have something from six years of work as he has conference papers and co-author publications. \n\nIn the worst case scenario that he gets no papers he can always make the case that his research did not bear fruit, this happens a lot and isn't anything to be ashamed of, as long as he has a thesis he has a case. I suggest he has a meeting and is very honest with his supervisor about his position, this can only help. \n\nHe has a job lined up which will act as a mental safety blanket. However not getting a PhD after six years will not be ideal. If he ever needs to use his CV for any other purpose there will be a big six year blotch and no matter how he explains why he didn't get his PhD the impression it gives is poor. \n\nI have my fingers crossed for you!

If you see nothing wrong with your work, but you're not getting constructive feed back, then it is well within your right to ask for something tangible to work with.\n\nBut if you're finding that your advisors are being very neglectful, it is also an option to talk to someone about it.

Of course, positive effect bias in publication means a lot of work that shows an effect of zero isn't documented, unfortunately.  This is a problem that I think exists in science as well, but to a much smaller degree.\n\nAs far as looking forward, there are many examples of how economists have helped designed systems/markets to make the world a better place.  One notable example is the work of Alvin Roth who worked to design the kidney exchange system in the United States.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_541hax.json"}, "280": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PhDConsultant", "Date": 1475153241, "Score": 1, "Body": "I keep a folder for each project I'm working on in dropbox.  This folder contains a \"To Read\" sub-folder for all the PDFs I haven't read yet, a word document (annotated bibliography) for the PDFs I have read, and the PDFs I have read.  Whether PDFs are in the folder or in the \"To Read\" sub-folder, I rename them by authors last name and year (e.g. Johnson2004.pdf).\n\nThe annotated bibliography is chronological by when I've read a paper.  I'll start by writing in bold: \"Last Name, First Name (year). Title.\"  This way it's easy to find the paper in the folder if I want to re-read it for any reason.  Then write a summary.  Then write why it's important for my work/for what reasons I will cite this paper.\n\nIf things start to get large/complicated, I use highlighting to visually tag whether papers are related to specific things (e.g. yellow for methods, blue for papers with alternative hypotheses, etc.), and create a key for these colors at the top of the document.\n\nIt's low-tech, but incredibly effective.  When you think to yourself about a paper you usually can remember when in time you read it first and for which project, which makes it easy enough to find the actual paper.  As far as syncing, it's on Dropbox, which is free and good enough for looking at on and even editing on the iPhone/iPad.\n\nI hate Mendeley and its competitors.  Also, get in the habit of deleting PDFs that aren't super interesting or extremely related to your work.
