Maybe it is not a direct question, but it is fundamental that you know what they are working on. Read their papers. Remember some names of other PhD students. You do not need to study them, however it is likely that you will find yourself talking about their research topics in one way or another and it would be really bad if you cannot put up a nice and formed conversation.\n* It seems stupid but the most important question is \"why do you want to do become PhD student?\". Every person has its own reasons. For me is the fact that I love trying things out and stick with an \"unsolved\" problem until I find my way through. I mentioned examples through my Bachelor and Master studies, such as both final projects, where I had positive research experiences. Any other related experience (work experience will help as well).\n* In my interview I used the examples of my work in other organizations to show what I like more from their research team. For example, you may like their position more because is a smaller team, or they have successful papers, or you personaly like the technology/topic they work on... It is not about critizising your previous experiences but to use them to clarify what you want to improve and what your expectations are.\n* Prepare questions to ask them. This is actually very important. It shows that you are interested, that you have done your research about them and will expose your expectations which is very useful for your professor to know. Ask everything that is not clear: working conditions, salary, teaching vs research time, conferences, holydays, publications \"schedule\"...\n* Be relaxed and honest. The point is not at all to fake the interview, that would be awful.

My reasons certainly would not apply to other applicants, I would be quite surprised to see anyone with similar reasons. \n\nI will not give my reasons here, but I tried to show that a PhD was actually the natural next step for me in life given some experiences that I had in industry, in teaching, and my personal life.

If I was not aware of that, if I lied in my answer, or if I tried to diminish the importance of coding, then I certainly would have a red flag here. \n\nAnother one is about my reasons to choose that university. I feel like this was the most important question during my interview. They don't want to waste time making an offer to someone who will probably go to another university.

Otherwise, you will learn Arabic or another Islamic-related language during your degree program. \n\nHistory is highly literary. Be prepared to read a whole book or two each week.

Knowing where the author got their info from, whether it has validity, the quality of their interpretation of their sources, and the effectiveness of their analysis, etc. \n\nBefore you pursue a history degree, the best thing you can do for yourself to prepare is to gain familiarity with your topic of interest (Islamic studies) and introduce yourself to \u201chistoriography\u201d.

Your writing is understandable, but you need to take all the advice from your supervisor(s) and everyone else available (your school's writing center? an academic writing course?), all the learning opportunities to improve your grammar, collocations and style to the high standards required by academic institutions in the English-speaking countries, especially the UK. It seems to me that you are doing well in the most important aspects of the PhD (doing research properly, developing technical skills, obtaining research results) - but learning to write and otherwise communicate your research is also important. You can learn it (you already did most of the work towards it when you learned English to this level), but it seems you need to be more open to this learning. There should be *some* creative freedom in academic writing, and writing in a less complicated way is usually good, but it is very important to use the correct terminology and layout, so that people can find and read your publications without extra efforts (because nobody has time for that). It doesn't matter that *some* publications are written in English similar as yours - you need to aim for the level of language in most publications in good conferences/journals where your supervisor publishes and wants you to publish. It is good that your supervisor is criticizing and thus teaching you, rather than doing the writing instead of you.\n\nIf you change to another university in the UK or another English-speaking country, you will encounter the same criticism (if they accept you at all). In some universities in countries where English isn't among main languages, you may be able to get away with your current level of writing - if you will only be publishing in less reputable conferences/journals, or not in English... or not at all. But that will most likely result in lesser academic career prospects after your PhD.\n\nOf course, your supervisor may still be an incompetent or unsuitable supervisor if this \"he may suggest one way of how things should proceed and at the next meeting, he may change his mind and diverge the progress trajectory\" refers to your actual research, and he doesn't explain to you why he is changing the direction.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/by0i2a/a_toxic_academic_environment_is_it_normal/eqbs6ow/"}, "329": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "berfection", "Date": 1559961096, "Score": 2, "Body": "I would give it as a thank you gift at the end of the program.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/bxv441/gift_for_my_advisor/eqc2h1e/"}, "330": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "FearTheCron", "Date": 1559964225, "Score": 2, "Body": "I would not give them a gift that early, especially one that expensive.

Try to avoid tough classes and choose electives for their ease - THis might be unpopular opinion but I know many people who are happy because of this. In grad school, you really wont have time to give 100% for each class and more often than not it becomes a slog. But to good thing is many grad school programs allow a lot of electives to let kids take classes that fit with their line of research.\n\n3. Accept that not many people know how to plan and execute or even identify good research projects - this comes with experience and practice along with a lot of reading. Ask you advisor to share their NIH/NSF/DOE whichever funding agency research proposal, you'll not only get to see your PIs research style but also how they go about asking solid research questions. Better yet, if you can get your hands on unsuccessful research proposals from your lab and review them to understand why they are weak. These kind of things helped me a lot to improve critical thinking. \nIt also helps if your PI give out papers that they get for review but not many advisors do it. \nLastly, always be thinking about alternative explanations for things but within reason (otherwise itll just turn one into a bitter cynical person that no one likes) \n\n4. Lastly, possibly the most important one - Create a schedule and stick to it - Grad school allows a lot of flexibility so students who are not planned fall into chaos, they come in at 11, stay on late, work on weekends. while flexibility is a good thing, it creates a feeling as if one is supposed to work all the time. Say no to that culture. Work (whatever 50-55 hrs because grad students still need to go a little bit above and beyond) fixed times, take care that you are getting some kind of exercise (even just biking to work) ,eat very properly( Diet solves several stress related issues) and sleep atleast 7 hrs a day. \n\nLets say, you are doing everything and somehow still luck isnt on your side and you are in a pit that you cannot seem to get out of, Seek help.

You have no peers really, and even your supervisor will not really know what you do on a daily basis. It is really important to bring as much structure as you can to your personal life therefore, since that will carry forward as much as possible to your professional life.\n\n2. Dont be super self critical. Remember you dont know what other phDs are doing at your stage and therefore dont have a baseline to compare with.

This is a big trap that causes me to give up a lot. Here I have 2 suggestions: (a) data is your friend. Spend time on the actual problem youre trying to investigate, rather than  just figuring out expanatory or causal variables. Do data work, which is more instantly gratifying. (b) take classes early on even if your supervisors and just indifferent to the idea. Classes also bring structure, which is important for our sanity. \n\nI have a few more but I think this shoulf get the ball rolling haha. Let me know if yiu need any more advice or want to talk.

I think the best advice I received was to find faculty you want to work with and apply to that school. Wanting to work with someone requires more than respect for their research or interest in their area of expertise. You should also research them, as people, as both teachers and colleagues (because if they don't treat you like the future colleague you're becoming, that's a warning sign). \n\nIf you can afford it, go to the big annual conference in your discipline and find them. Find where they are presenting or on a panel or where their college is holding a reception. Walk up and introduce yourself. I did. How each person responded told me a lot about the kind of advisor they'd be. I ended up working with a Prof I hadn't even been looking for. I had interrupted his conversation to ask if another Prof was there, but he wasn't upset and didn't give me a yes/no answer. He introduced himself and then took me around the room to introduce me to others and look for the other Prof. He talked to me about my research interests. He LISTENED. And when I was accepted to his school, he called and told me, told me I'd received a scholarship, and he'd be my advisor, IF that was okay with me. If you can't afford to go to the conference, email them with specific questions. Do they answer their emails? Are they willing to schedule a call with a potential student? Tells you a lot.\n\nMy advisor was a great mentor. He gave great advice, but never tried to control my work. He always said he had confidence in me, even when I didn't. He helped me put my findings into language. He never doubted my findings were important just because I struggled to explain them sometimes. When defending with other faculty, he'd always let me answer a question fully, then he'd chime in up back me up with more senior colleagues. He was a good editor and actually read my work and provided critical and timely feedback. I could count on him to answer emails, keep appointments, and meet deadlines. \n\nI think no matter how good they are as researchers or even classroom teachers, there should be a way to evaluate faculty for these qualities before allowing them to advise doctoral students.

If he notices I'm tired he'll insist that I go home and rest. When he sees that I'm feeling stressed out or insecure about work he is very reassuring, saying stuff like \"you've got this\" or just \"you're doing great work\". He knows I'm quite shy and not very comfortable with oral presentations and this kind of stuff so he'll take time out if his day to practice the presentations with me and comment on things I can work on. \n\nFor example my first presentation at a bigg-ish conference was last year, and I was TERRIFIED. The presentation was on a Monday and I went back to the lab to practice the presentation one last time with him on the sunday before. He sent me a text the morning of the presentation saying good luck. When the presentation was done I went outside to calm my nerves and grab a smoke and he went looking for me to tell me I did a good job and ask how I was feeling about it. When we went back to the lab he told pretty much everyone that would hear it that I did great and was genuinely proud.\n\nOther than that he is quite demanding and still offers criticism on my work of course but it's always constructive and well meaning. He guides me but he also lets me make my own hypotheses and design experiment to work on it (with his approval if I can justify the experiment, of course).\n\nOverall he's very invested in my work but also invested in my career. He's currently organizing an international conference and he's including me in the organization even though he doesn't actually need my help. He just asked me if I wanted to be part of the organization because he knew it could be interesting for me and that it would be good for my career.\n\nAll in all, he's a great advisor and just a good person, but It's probably important to point out that although he's a fantastic advisor to me, he would not be and has not been a good advisor to everyone. Before I started the PhD I was a master student with him and the other MD student he had had a bad experience. He's not very hands-on for the experiments and she felt left on her own devices while I was fine with it because I'm quite fond of being independent and would definitely have hated the \"helicopter parent\" kind of management style that I've seen in other PIs.

I've come to the conclusion that I feel that way for two reasons. The TL;DR is that I always heard about how tough med school is, but much less about how tough PhDs are, and I don't get quite the same camaraderie as those going through the MD process. (And imposter syndrome gets the better of me. Also, sorry for the novel, the summary is that I sympathize with your feelings.)\n\nTo the first point, I was at a very small school where a good majority of those in bio/chem related majors where heading towards professional school. Highly motivated classmates, all driving for As and high GPAs. In comparison, my slightly more average grades felt like underachieving. I was originally considering medicine so stepping away from that and deciding not to study for the MCAT was a big turn into a direction that I knew relatively little about, and which my family and friends knew relatively little about. As I kept down the grad school track, friends were in professional school and talking on and on about how hard classes were. It's hard to compare in PhD land because a busy semesters is *maybe* 2 courses with the rest of your time crammed with research. So I sometimes got the impression from friends that they felt like my hours in the lab were \"playing\" compared to hours over the books. \n\nTo the second point, med school gets to mark big events in school with things like the white coat ceremony (at that point, all they've done is be accepted!). They move as a class of several hundred and celebrate passing boards as a group, etc. Meanwhile, we in PhD land have to move along at our own, individual pace. You can never compare your progress well to anyone else because research moves at different paces. We take and pass huge milestones like prelims all alone, with little fanfare, and no photos to post. Unless you have family or friends who did a PhD, it's a little bit of a black box that we disappear into, muddle around for awhile, and come out the other end with a degree. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, I've had conversations with friends and family that have buoyed me when I start feeling like I'm somehow on a lesser track. One former lab partner, a now MD who I've always seen as extremely smart, has said that it's obvious I was the one out of the class who went the PhD route because I was super smart and good at lab work. My parent is an MD and had a convo with a patient who asked if any kids were becoming doctors and my parent said I was doing my PhD. The patient said that was even harder since it was research. In my mind (when it's rational and not feeling stupidly inferior), the challenges of research and a PhD and the challenges of professional school are just wildly different.

I'm now entering the last year of my PhD. These are the things that, to me, make the LDR work:\n\n* Commitment. Well, duh. But to elaborate a little, I treat loving him as a decision, a choice, a verb, an action. And like any action, if you do it often enough, it becomes a habit. It's like breathing. It's as much a part of my routine as grabbing my keys and putting on my shoes before I go out. I don't have to think about it anymore; loving him is just another layer over my existence, like an invisible jacket enveloping me as I go about my day. When I do think about it -- \"Do I love him? Well, yeah. I decided to. I'm going to keep deciding to, because that's part of what loving someone is.\"\n* Sheer stubbornness. This is tied to the above. Because I see love as a decision and an action, because I believe in taking responsibility for your actions, and because I have a tendency to be hard on myself, there are no take-backsies for me. \"You chose to love him. You're going to see it through, whatever happens, however long things last.\" Honestly, I feel more conviction about our relationship than I do about anything I've been doing at grad school.\n* Communication routines. I think we have found a good balance of what we talk about, when we talk, and how we talk when we are apart. Of course, it felt perfunctory, forced, and/or inadequate at first, because of the anxiety to feel connected. But things have simmered to where communicating long-distance is just normal and comfortable, but not stale.\n* Trust. Again, conscious decision is involved: deciding to trust him, and not deciding to do anything that would betray his trust.\n* Support. Obviously, I would not be studying if I didn't have his emotional/moral support for my studies. If I went on to study without it, our relationship probably would have ended already, or it wouldn't be in great shape. In turn, I support his career, too.\n* Acceptance. The situation is not ideal, but it's what is right now. Raging against it, or worse, lashing out at each other, isn't going to change things for the better.\n* Some idea of where we want to be when I graduate. Without more specifics, this is really just another restatement of bullet point number one: we have decided, and continue to decide, that we still want to be together when this is over.\n* Focusing on the present and the good, when physically together. When we do get to share the same point in time and space for a while, there can be pressure to make sure it's the best! romantic! fun! time! ever! But, of course, shit happens. One of us might be sick. One of us might be pestered by an intrusive boss/supervisor/parent/sibling. Dealing with it requires some specific, situational acceptance: I've learned to mentally recognize -- not deny -- the intrusion of negativity and then just let it be. \"Yes, this sad/awful/annoying thing is happening, but I'm not going to let it take my energy for enjoying just being with him right now.\" I am stubborn about seeking silver linings.

However, during my first Master's degree, I applied for a job, went to the interview and got it within one hour of leaving. I thought that going into industry was a great idea and that there was no point in doing a PhD as I could earn enough money to set me up for life. However, after three years of chasing that bank balance, I realised that life isn't all about money, and that working in industry was not going to let me technically progress as much as I'd like to, as you pretty much do the same thing you're good at day in, day out. So, I decided it was time to leave and pursue a PhD.\n\n(As a side note: I also hated the office politics and the massive blame culture they had, and I also detested that the people above me were getting twice (or in some cases, three times as much) to do less work than myself (and, some of them weren't even qualified to be in that position, but had the tenure of being there long enough)). \n\nAnyways, I was the last person my current supervisors interviewed for the PhD and I got an acceptance email maybe 3 days afterwards. I handed in my notice at my old job, without even discussing it with my former bosses, and never looked back. They tempted me with a significant pay rise, a promotion and better work-life balance, but I just had enough. \n\nI've now had some of the best experiences whilst doing this PhD programme by working closely with other researchers, and an industrial placement (which was an eye opener to see how other companies and people work in industry - and not just the dogmatic view of my previous employer - oh, and how others get treated like human beings). I've also been to conferences all over the world, as well. Networking has increased significantly, considering I do this PhD remotely. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean it is all good, as there have been some rough times mentally, but overall it is good. I also attribute some of the skill set I learned in industry towards the PhD and believe that it gave me a head start, so to speak.

If you're really passionate about teaching and would be okay doing that at a smaller school, doing a lower-ranked PhD or part-time PhD might be okay (Virginia Tech has a decent program but you do have to go to Washington DC for the residencies).

A lot went down at a recent conference, where I felt like, overall, she treated me like a child rather than a colleague (despite us being both 29 year-old married women). The last night in town, after all the conference proceedings had ended, a large group of professors and doc students from our university went out for dinner/ drinks. A number of professors insisted on buying doc students drinks, saying that we should reciprocate for our own doc students when the time comes. She seemed angry that I was drinking/ having a good time/ letting my guard down and being myself. On the walk back to the hotel (\\~4 blocks in a very good neighborhood) she acted as if I had held her up at the bar, and she had wanted to go back to the hotel hours ago because we had an early flight. She even went so far as to complain to one of the professors in our department (someone who I do research with, but she does not) that I constantly make her late for everything, and that I wouldn't have been able to make it to any of the conference proceedings if it hadn't been for her physically getting me out of bed in the morning (not even close to true). The next morning she did take it upon herself to physically get me out of bed by turning on every. single. light. in the hotel room and repeatedly yelling that I needed to get up because I was going to make her miss her flight. While she did her make-up for the next 45 minutes, I was dressed and ready to go in 5 minutes. I was livid. At the airport she insisted that I was lost and didn't know where I was going, even though I led us directly to TSA after she wandered around looking for the correct terminal for 15 minutes. Once we got through security I didn't speak to her (or walk anywhere with her) for the rest of the day of traveling, even though we were on all the same flights. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put off talking to her for a while because I was too angry with her, and I knew that anything that came out would be innapropriate. I know that I need to have some kind of conversation with her about how she is not my mother, we don't need to be connected at the hip, she is free to come and go without me as she pleases, she does not need to wait on me, and I am a grown ass woman who has taken care of myself all these years without her. I just don't know when or where to broach the subject. The tension in our office and during seminars is palpable. And this conference incident is on top of all the other resentments I was already harboring against her due to her making the office a social rather than professional/ academic working space. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnless she leaves the program for some reason, I have already been warned that I am going to be stuck sharing an office and hotel rooms with her for the next three years.

I\u2019m (24F) currently a first year PhD student for BioE and I\u2019m experiencing a lot of the same issues you are. I\u2019ve never worked a real job before usually just gotten by doing research related internships and have a supportive family that help me financially. Now that I have to rely on myself to come up with the projects that fit such a specialized field (that I feel I can\u2019t fully get a grasp on) I\u2019m really starting to experience a lot of anxiety. \n\nI feel like every time I come up with a research topic and look at relevant literature it becomes less and less feasible. On top of that setting my own hours just gives me too much freedom to (like you) procrastinate. What\u2019s even weirder is I\u2019ve brought up my concerns about not being on track or getting enough done to my PI and fellow researches and they seem to think it\u2019s all on my head and it\u2019ll all come together. I don\u2019t know if it just takes time or if I\u2019m one research article away from finding something out that will make it all click but living with this much anxiety is not fun so I feel you on that. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m among the youngest in my program and many of the others come from industry.
