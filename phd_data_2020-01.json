Given everything you\u2019ve said, I have no doubt everybody you dealt with was instructed to act in a way that minimises liability and prevented opening the institution to legal consequences. \n\n&gt;\tTheir job is to try to de-escalate a situation before it becomes a formal grievance. Imagine if a formal complaint was filed every time an indignant/hurt/angry/etc. student wrote to their chair about a professor?\n\nNo. This is what you want their job to be, but that doesn\u2019t make it so. How often do you imagine students write to the chair about a prof. I\u2019ve heard of maybe a handful at my institution in the last decade, each of which had to be dealt with formally. If you wanted to discuss things with the professor then ask for that, or be a grown up and discuss them directly. You asked for a complaint to be raised and then complained that they raised a complaint! \n&gt;\tThe key here is that this isn\u2019t a relationship between peers; a professor (even ex-professor) is in the position of power. A student has a lot more to lose when such relationship sours than the professor.\n\nTrue. This doesn\u2019t mean that the prof must automatically forgive and forget though. You had a lot more to lose, and you lost.\n&gt;\tEdit- But in such case the university would be admitting to erroneously filing a grievance; and ego is more important than student/alumni wellbeing.\n\nThey didn\u2019t erroneously file anything. And your well-being as an example student is quite far down the list, and seemingly not in their gift to give. \n\n&gt;\tEdit- The alternative was to discipline the chair when I complained (about him filing the grievance) but they weren\u2019t going to do that when he brings in a lot of research money. \n\nIt\u2019s got nothing to do with research income. The chair did nothing wrong so why would they be disciplined? You asked for a grievance to be filed, they filed one. They\u2019re not puppets who *must* do whatever they\u2019re told. \n\nYou talk about how people should be forced to do as you want, how they should be disciplined as soon as you complain and also how they should be empathetic to your distress. Why don\u2019t you show a little empathy to them? You have very likely caused them some distress, you\u2019ve tried to have some of them fired, you\u2019ve brought their personal and professional standards into disrepute, and all for what? Because you have a self-admitted infatuation *with the idea* of a professor who may or may not have been curt with you in an email. \n\nThe constant advice to seek help and question your mental health that you receive on these threads is for the most part well intentioned. Your conditions are causing you to think and act in a way that is uncomfortable both for you, and for people around you. At this point it is certainly not a positive trait, and something you need to learn to manage more effectively if you want to stand any chance of progressing in the way you\u2019ve suggested.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/efu7a7/how_stressful_is_a_phd/fctvjmi/"}, "86": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "PlantGahdess722", "Date": 1577967272, "Score": 2, "Body": "Ugh...

People who are not students or faculty can absolutely file complaints, it's just rarer. And in most of those cases, they'd involve someone who was contracted out so they'd be held under the procedure of their workplace. If there is no explicit system for handing complaints from the public then it falls under the direction of the person who takes the complaint, with guidance from others in the university.

Only do so if you are sure about exiting the program (mention the source of your woes freely but DO NOT mention your thought about quitting unless you are ready to follow through unless you trust your PI completely).\n\nWith regards to your resume, there are ways to list PhD exits without bringing up alarm bells.

They may destroy everyone else around them, but they'll remain relatively unscathed and completely oblivious to what they've done. There's very much a narrative that everyone with mental illness will have an unstable life that's heading for disaster and will inevitably spiral and continue to hit rock bottom with disastrous results, but that's not true for everyone depending on the diagnosis and a million other factors. And I'm not meaning to cause offence or minimise the experience of people that has happened to, because I'm one of them. \n\n\nI think she has done this many times before, I don't know if calling her a survivor is the correct term because of its positive connotations but she's evidently emerged unscathed from however many times its happened before. Sort of like a cockroach.\n\n\nThere's a lot to unpack with Gemini and I suspect if she had adequate psychiatric care she'd have a number of diagnoses on top of her OCD and anxiety. I'm not being an armchair psychologist but as a person with [borderline personality disorder] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) who has gone scorched earth on more occasions in my past than I care to admit, I'm seeing her actions with the professor fit almost perfectly into a lot of the diagnostic criteria and distinguishing symptoms for BPD:\n\n\n* Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined\u00a0abandonment\u00a0and extreme reactions: panicking over an unanswered email led to this whole fiasco, not to mention her rejection at not being able to have the professor as her advisor or as a friend after graduation/retirement\n* Intense or uncontrollable emotional reactions that often seem disproportionate to the event or situation: I don't think I need to clarify this one\n* Unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships: burning bridges with every level of the university is a good example\n* marked sensitivity to minor rejection or criticism: the essay mark and comment\n* alternating between extremes of idealisation and devaluation toward other people: the idealisation is obvious. We haven't seen much of the devaluation but there was one comment I remember where she showed a level of utter contempt and hatred towards the professor - from memory she felt the professor was a narcissist and had taken advantage of her admiration for her and that she hoped that her career was destroyed as a result of what happened, I can't remember precisely and it got lost in the great deleting spree. \n\n\nI think this will run its course until Gemini will suddenly decide that the professor has done her so wrong that she's not worth her time anymore.

My program is relatively new at the school with very small cohorts and junior faculty. YMMV.  It is definitely doable with work, family, etc.  However, you won't be able to commit as totally as your full-time counterparts who are probably working at the school, teaching, etc. It isn't a criticism of abilities merely a recognition that time is the one thing you can't stretch. I bristled when I first heard this, but now I understand. The only difference for me vs. FT was one course per semester which results in one additional year of coursework. First year papers are still due at the end of the first year without the benefit of some theory courses but with the same grading standard. Furthermore, there is some animosity towards PT scholars. I don't know if this is some form of academic hazing/gatekeeping or something else. I do think that there is little upside for faculty to take on part-time PhD students since you will have limited time to assist with teaching, grading, research etc. for your faculty.  However, I do think it forces you to be judicious with your time and focus on the areas that interest you the most and will help you in your dissertation. You probably won't become an expert in every research method but you can really focus on the most relevant ones for your field. Not every course will have the same importance in what you do in the future. I have had to make some compromises with time and grades.

I just want to sit here and play old-school Zelda or something\".  \n\nMy last proper class my schedule was basically like this.\n\nMon-Fri work the day job.\n\nMon-class at night. \nTues-Find three articles to read\nWed, Thurs, Fri,-Read each article. \nSat. Write the paper\nSun. Finish writing the paper.\n\nAnd it all begins again. \n\nIn June the year I started this program I was hanging out with a couple of friends. One of them had just started at the Police Academy. \n\nMe: So how's it going?\nHim: This is the busiest I've ever been in my life  \nMe: *laughs in that sort of \"I hear ya, man\" way*\nHim: *laughs back* . . .

I was telling another friend whose wife just gave birth to his second child that I kind if empathized with him.  He said \"I come home from work, and it doesn't matter HOW BAD  my day was, I walk in that door, and I'm dad.\"  I have a similar situation because no matter how bad my day was, I cone home and the reality is that I need to start working on this PhD stuff.\n\n  I try to keep to a regular gym schedule.

Never give up.  Never surrender. \n\n\n2. It's going to be stressful. Make time for a regular workout routine.  You owe it to yourself. \n\n\n3. There's a lot of research that says time away from the work can actually help. Take breaks, but be careful not to use this strategy as an avoidance activity. \n\n\n4. Most people won't understand how hard you work. \n\n\n5. You're probably pretty smart. That's great.  Be prepared to have that put to the test. What worked before won't necessarily work now.  \n\n\n6. Don't be afraid to get some help regarding your mental health.  Most colleges and universities have free counseling services for students. Now everyone's path is unique, and everyone's story is different, but I know that I regret not reaching out for help earlier. \n\n\n7. Be prepared to hear \"no\" a lot. I already said that what worked for you before might not work now. You'll also have reqests ignored, emails unreturned, and if you do get responses, people won't want to help you. The IRB will reject your ideas, and you'll be forced to reconceptualize your study. You can do it though. Why?

On top of the funding difficulties, the field will have moved on substantially in those 8 years to the point that your project (and start-of-degree literature review) might be semi-obsolete by the end.

I only see the latter on an *ad hoc* basis - when all else is failing - though\n\nYup and that's very much what I was trying to get at in my previous comment. So to live in society, let's say you need reasonably good interpersonal relationships or the capacity to do so, be able to gain employment, not behave in such a way that's dangerous or illegal, can gain adequate health care when needed, have enough financial resources for food, clothing, housing etc. That's kind of more or less how I think most people would define the kinds of things that would show you're a functioning member of society. \n\nThere's plenty of people that don't have this ability, and even in your line of work where you're more likely to see dysfunction you only see it when everything has totally fallen apart. Most people generally wouldn't see it unless that person doesn't have a safety net or support from family or friends and requires other assistance (such as, we know that the homeless rates are significantly higher than reported because it doesn't tend to include those that aren't officially on the list for assistance like people who may be couch surfing between friends or family). Or their behaviour or health makes them act in such a way that they're a danger to themselves or others (and I mean a real danger, not just perceived), or they've lost the ability to make decisions for themselves so then health professionals and the authorities may get involved.\n\nIf you've got enough money to get by, and if you act in such a way that while you may be a complete nutjob but you're not actually hurting anyone or doing anything illegal, then it's entirely possible to have a pretty damn high level of mental illness but still continue to \"function\". \n\nI think we can say with a pretty high degree of certainty that Gemini is being supported financially somehow - on campus accommodation is expensive plus I find it kind of unusual that a 37yo would choose to live under those kinds of restrictions. I can't make a conclusion on that without totally reaching, but let's say if you've got a kid that tends to bounce from place to place and isn't the greatest at dealing with the practicalities of life then if you're giving financial support then you'd want as much of it as possible to go directly to the provider so it's being used for the purpose it's intended and can't be touched otherwise. \n\nShe said that she's taken longer to complete her degree than usual so she's probably not on a scholarship, and in none of her posts regarding masters or PhD study has she even mentioned finances being a consideration. She refuses to take work that she sees as being below her, so she's probably not struggling financially or has any experience of doing so. She wasn't as concerned by the housing instability as she initially made out, because she said she could've asked her dad but stayed in hotels which she said was \"expensive but fun\". I don't know many unemployed students, mature age or otherwise, who'd be able to do that even at the cheapest nastiest hotels.\n\nAs far as we know, all she's done is burn her way through the levels of the university but has stopped short of actually contacting the professor herself. So no stalking, no illegal activity, just being a pain in the ass. And doing it through the official channels is probably an anxiety mechanism as well, in the past I liked to keep a paper trail when I was fucking shit up at work and burning bridges so no one could twist my words and I could look at it with a sense of satisfaction like \"*well*, I did everything right so it must be their fault that it went wrong\".\n\n&gt;&gt;She'll move on, possibly to a new location and another attempt at a different career, and do it all again.\n\n&gt;Of course, how does no one else realise this?\n\nBecause she's presenting like she's in crisis mode and the expectation is that she's going to implode because no one could possibly act like this unless they were in the throes of a psychotic breakdown. I don't think people realise the resilience that people like Gemini have when this is actually her baseline like you said, it's not abnormal to her. \n\nI think a lot of people don't understand that mental illness is not always an condition that requires immediate treatment to prevent harm and that it'll get under control, it can be chronic and many people with personality disorders never receive treatment or officially get it under control but still \"manage\" by using enough maladaptive coping strategies to keep you on balance enough to keep things running.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/efu7a7/how_stressful_is_a_phd/fdfvby1/"}, "472": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MrsBirdman555", "Date": 1578375679, "Score": 1, "Body": "Either that or your poor expression of sarcasm.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/eaxsgf/need_i_say_more/fdg0kok/"}, "473": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LifeWithMaiky", "Date": 1578383162, "Score": 1, "Body": "If you\u2019re not planning to be a professor in academics it will be all about preference and the program at that point.

I saw a lisitng, sent in my application, had an interview, was accepted. This had funding attached with a sponsor and was very straight forward. process during the PhD is usually 3 years full time, mine is 4 due to the sponsorship. First year for me is Lit review and 1st experiment, 2nd year is 1 big experiment, 3rd year is 1 small experiment and writing. By end of 1st year we are meant to get to 10k words, 2nd year 20k, and then final thesis is between 60-80k words. \n\n\u2022When accepted into a program, was everything paid for? \n\nYes, and my sponsorship gives me a large expenses budget. other students that are governemt/university funded also have an expenses allowence but its much smaller. that will be for travelling to conferences.

Also, he didn't read any of the papers I published up to this point, even though they all have his name on them. Because he is like this, I don't know what is normal anymore. How much responsibility should fall onto me and how much onto him. All my academic life I did things alone, but I stumbled a lot because since the beginning (BA) no one taught me anything, so I had to figure out things as I went and that meant a lot of mistakes.

They really did not go out of their way to accommodate me in times where I could have used a lot more help. However, they could have kicked me out of the group which they did not do and I am grateful for that. \n\n4) Yes, several times. Because after some point, I really stopped seeing a point in anything and everything. I really started to get the feeling that no matter what I do, it will never be enough. I was always finding myself falling short. Like I explained, the only thing that helped a bit is acceptance although it still feels ridiculous that it is the way it is. \n\n5) I would recommend, Yes because I think the training is worth it but I would warn them that they need to make sure that they are mentally strong (i.e do not have significant health issues prior because PhD will only make it worse) and I would ask them to think if they understand what they need to do in order to get a PhD and that they would genuinely like doing that. \n\n6) I worked in a couple of research groups. While I would describe my current one as extremely healthy, the ones I was with previously were unnecessarily competitive and toxic. So, it is very important to meet you co-workers before hand and maybe also chat with graduates to see how your potential advisor runs/manages the group.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/elso7g/quick_survey_of_wellbeing_throughout_your_phd/fdmzbw7/"}, "568": {"Subreddit": "u_PdexpertPhD", "Author": "deltapickle", "Date": 1578573812, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you for your content &lt;3", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PdexpertPhD/comments/em8nd9/therapy_resistance/fdn0v8f/"}, "569": {"Subreddit": "u_Brer_Caleb_PhD", "Author": "Tiny_Pay", "Date": 1578576055, "Score": 1, "Body": "John Kerry is a liar and a traitor.

My own seemed intimidating but fair in interviews, friendly and personable upon meeting face to face and for the first few weeks seemed an absolutely reasonable human. It took about six months to see the other side of him, I think it's often when shit hits the fan be it with the research or even in the personal life of your supervisor that their real colours show but there's no way to know that before starting. \nPeople often recommend talking to current PhD students in private before accepting to ask their opinions, but most won't risk turning you away from a position and you potentially telling their supervisor they were critical and played a role in them losing a candidate. I think the chances of finding someone brave or jaded enough to be honest are slim until you've accepted and gotten to know them. Especially with the pyramid style accountability you have with students and their supervisors where you're completely dependent on them for a reference and to progress your career, it seems there really needs to be some means of rating supervisors that is transparent and recognised that new students can access before taking a position.

I'm currently getting a second master's degree to recoup that year with an amazing advisor but in a subject that I'm not as enthusiastic about; I have a few thoughts about choosing a place for grad school.\nMy main recommendation for the visit is to see how well you think that you'll work with the potential advisor. Get a feel for how they run their lab (do they have regular meetings with students or weekly lab group meetings, both? Do they expect you to run some side projects on top of your thesis? Would you be mentoring undergrads?). I would also try to get a sense of what work-life balance looks like in the lab (are you expected to work weekends or evenings regularly?)\nI would also make sure that you meet with their current students and get to know what they like best and least about them. Be aware if they're dodging answers/what they're not saying because sometimes it can be hard to speak out about a bad advisor if they're scared of reprisals. You can also ask how things have gone when conflicts arise (you can also ask this of the potential advisor to get a feeling for how they deal with this). \nI would also try to suss out what they expect their students to do after graduation (do they expect all of their students to stay in academia or are they conscious of the fact that the academic job market is terrible and understand that students going into industry is a legitimate career path?). It feels like a long way away but it can be pretty revealing of how they run things.\nAlso, do they have a project for you to work on right off the bat or are you expected to develop something on your own? Ideally (in STEM at least) you can start off with a project that is predetermined and as you work on it, you develop your own questions and directions. You don't want to spend too long floating around trying to figure out what you're doing or basically be doing grunt work for your advisor. \nFor the class, ask a question/participate if you're genuinely motivated to, but don't talk just because you think that you should. Depending on the level/where they're at in the semester it might be normal for you to only kind of understand what they're doing. \nThe most important thing in my opinion is having a healthy and happy lab life, along with doing publishable work (not just because pubs are good, but because being published means that your work is good, which will keep you motivated). So make sure that you get along with your advisor and that you think that you'll like living there for 4-6 years.\n\nI recommend to get a good idea of what the general timeline and milestones for the program are from the graduate studies director. They vary between programs and it's good to get an idea of when you're going to be doing comps, your prospectus, etc and how much course work is typically involved. It should also give you a feel for how long you're expected to take to get a PhD (is it 4 years and then you're on trouble or is there flexibility to take longer if need be?). I would also recommend asking your potential advisor about timeline because they ultimately know what they want for their lab. \n\nFinally, I would say relax, be yourself. You're just as much trying to see if you're a good fit as they are. You made it this far, so someone (likely multiple people) has seen potential in you already :)\n\nTldr: make sure that you get along with the advisor and feel like working with them for the next 4-6 years in that program won't screw up your mental health.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/eo4ava/tips_for_phd_campus_visit/fe8ms81/"}, "841": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "FantasticHovercraft", "Date": 1578929485, "Score": 5, "Body": "I'm interested, but does it have to be audio messages?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/eo5gs4/phd_accountability_buddy/fe8qrpa/"}, "842": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "stestuff", "Date": 1578929808, "Score": 1, "Body": "Makes sense.

My first and 2nd year were immensely challenging for me. I struggled in many different ways and had crippling self doubt. I got better in my 3rd year.

It's your introduction and should be evidence of your promise as a scholar. But many scholars don't make their biggest contributions with their dissertation, that comes later. Of course you should try to write the best dissertation you can, but don't put insane pressure on yourself.\n\nAs for letting down your professor, I wouldn't worry about that. Good advisors care about how their students get on, but at the end of the day, most aren't super personally invested to the extent they're let down by the fate of any one student. Remember, no need to apply extra pressure on yourself.\n\nAlso, congrats! Rest up! You got this.

When the expert never became who they are sitting and listening to classroom lectures and doing homework, why should students do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least in technology engineering, 3-5 years out of college, many realize that they are doing stuff very different from what they learned in college, and most of it picked up on the job, reading and doing on requirement and curiosity basis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn technology management, one's interpersonal skills are so much more important than other things, and academia in general disregards teaching those. People learned on the job, outside classroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally feel master's programs are simply a consequence of university's need to pool money to do other things. They then reverse engineered some bullshit justification to attract people.  I am a bit shy to call it a scam.. because students indeed learn a bit in the process.

If your goal is only to teach, you may not need a PhD. \n\nThe whole process has a ton of important parts, so it's hard to think what exactly would be useful for you now. Feel free to ask.\n\nIt's not absolutely required to stop working, but it's close to that. A PhD is a lot like a job, much more than getting another kind of degree like a bachelor's or a master's. \n\nIn the US as a foreigner, you usually won't be allowed to work. But even if you are allowed to, I really don't recommend it. Coursework, research and other responsibilities that you have as a PhD student will leave little time for anything else. Even without working, a PhD in the US can really push your limits. \n\nBeing \"Ivy\" or not is not really the way to go when choosing a university for a PhD. There are some rankings that can help (UT Dallas ranking for research is an example, but I know that there are some more specific for Finance), and research fit is very important. An Ivy institution may actually be an awful choice, while a lesser known one can be an amazing place to do your PhD. \n\nValuation is a big and old topic in Finance. CAPM, for example, is already decades old. So, a LOT of research has been done about the topic for more than half a century at least. You should have a very good idea about what has already been done about it, and what kind of contribution you think you can make to the scientific knowledge about valuation. \n\nA PhD in Finance also requires a very good knowledge of math and statistics. Since you are 40 yo, maybe you haven't really used a lot of stuff like linear algebra lately (I'm 46, and that was my case at least). Programming skills are also very important. Be ready for that kind of thing. \n\nDon't count on finding two clear stages like you mentioned (pre PhD preparation and muddy research time, as you put it). It may happen. But, as I said, a PhD is more like a job. They may give you some time to prepare, but you need to get things done even if you didn't really have much of a preparation.

If you are organized and plan your work efficiently, it would make sense that you can get everything done in a 40-hour work week. Biology experiments are also kind of a special case since cells grow when they grow and you can't make them fit to a 9-5 schedule. I have some people in my lab who do experiments with microbes and their schedules are terrible because once an experiment starts, you can't just pause it.\n\nThe one thing that I would say could be a legitimate worry is that you may not be progressing your degree/dissertation as quickly as you should. This might be the source of your uneasiness and could be easily rectified by writing out a timeline for your work and making sure you and your advisor are on the same page about when you are going to graduate. It is never too early to start thinking about this, and in fact if your workload is manageable right now then you should take advantage of this time to make sure you have an graduation strategy with clear deadlines for each stage of the process.  Figure out when you are going to form a committee, have a proposal defense, take quals, and whatever other milestones you need to get your degree. Then put them down on paper and discuss them with your advisor. \n\nMy advisor was always totally hands-off and okay with whatever timeline, and he kept telling me that it wasn't time yet to do things like form a committee, write a dissertation proposal, etc. This led me to take my time with experiments, get lost in side projects, and not get a committee put together until it was well past time to do so (5 years in...). Now I'm rushing to catch up and it's hell. So make sure that you are progressing along your degree path in a timely manner, and that the work you are doing is contributing to your thesis/dissertation research. As long as that is the case, I wouldn't worry at all that you have a manageable workload!

The truth is that type of work takes inherently longer because pure bio is painfully slow of a process. Imo, the more computational your lab is , the more you have a tendency to have more free time because your output is measured via your own abilities solely and not limited by external factors such as cell behavior/animal behaviors and growth patterns.\n\nI might get shafted for saying this but as someone who has done wet lab before and is trying to do more drylab now, the difference is this:\n\nWet lab tends to be far easier intellectually but harder physically and emotionally. The work is a lot simpler to explain in lamen terms compared to someone working on baynesian networks for gene regulation or someone researching theoretical pharmacokinetic models. However, the work is often limited by periods of relatively dead time. You have to work and be diligent in order to even get to a point where you can obtain data from a cell line or for tumors to proliferate in a mouse model.\n\nDry labs tend to be intellectually harder than wet labs.  The baseline to even get to a point where you can advance the scientific aspect of what you are studying usually includes a  pretty decent mastery of mathematics (statistics and algorithms) in addition to programming. However, it is far easier to obtain results and you rarely have a tendency to ever go in on the weekends.\n\nYou working with human models and clinical data set actually fit into the latter categories imo in the sense that you aren't responsible for taking care of your human patients like researchers often are for animals. Therefore, you don't really have to worry about going in every weekend.  I reckon your work is a lot more challenging to explain and can be a lot more dry on the surface level compared to your peers.

Research is what gets you a Ph.D. and a job. The only function of upper year courses is to get you going on research. The only bottom line is research.\n\n1. Writing a thesis is not like anything that you have done before. Previously, all you had to do was absorb material that was presented to you. Now you have to do original work yourself.\n2. Students often expect that they will do a thesis as follows: they will come across a problem that has to be solved (or one will be given to them), and they will solve it. This is indeed how many theses are done in the sciences. However, it very rarely happens in our field. Papers often read as if they had been written that way. But usually the process by which the paper was written (and the problem defined) was much more indirect.\n3. Some students use the approach of trying to master everything relevant to a topic before they begin writing a thesis. This is a mistake. You will never feel that you have learned everything. The best thing to do is start doing research, and then master whatever tools and auxiliary material you need as you go along. It is much better to present your work and look foolish because you didn\u2019t know something that you should have known than to not have anything to present.\n4. Similarly, many students think that the way to write a thesis is to spend a long time developing a \u201ctopic,\u201d then, once the topic is well defined and approved by advisors, begin writing. This does not work. You can only really define your topic as you go along.\n5. Doing research is a skill. The only way to learn it is to do it. The sooner you start the better. Your first few productions will be bad. This happens to everybody. So don't be a perfectionist. Get practice going through the process.\n6. Second and third year field courses are not like any other course you have taken before. The goal is not to master some material and take a test at the end. You are not being judged (as you are during the first year). The only goal is to give you tools and to get you moving on research.\n7. See your advisors a lot. A huge amount of time is wasted by students going off on tangents, re-inventing the wheel, or trying to solve impossible problems. Use your advisors as a guide to where you should be going.\n8. Talk to your peers. You have to learn how to talk about your work. Also, listening to others talk about their work will help you develop a better feel for how research is done.\n9. Don\u2019t be scared to write things down and show them to friends and advisors. Early criticism is essential in guiding you on the right path. Accepting criticism is a skill to be learned. Criticism hurts infinitely more when it is applied to a finished project that you have invested a lot of effort in. Remember, we do not expect the same quality output from grad students that we do from faculty, and we do not expect the same quality from early projects that we do from a dissertation. But if you don't produce any output, you will never get better.\n10. If you are ambivalent as to what subject to work on or what advisor to work under, pick one and work quickly. If you take two months writing a paper on a subject that you subsequently decide does not interest you, then you have gained valuable experience doing research that can be applied elsewhere. If you spend a year writing the same paper, you will be trapped with a subject that you don't like.\n11. Read journal articles and working papers, and go to seminars (both regular weekly workshops and job market seminars) and weekly lunches. This is the only way to learn what good research is like. But read papers intelligently: you don't have to go through most papers equation by equation. As your interests narrow down, there will be some papers that you do want to go through with a fine tooth comb. Your comfort with reading journal articles will grow with the number you read.\n12. Keep your eye on the bottom line.

But if you\u2019re taking undergrad into account this makes more sense. So it depends on a lot of circumstances. What field are you going into? Are you trying to get into an R1 school?   Assuming you\u2019re in the US. Typically the undergrad university doesn\u2019t matter as much as long as you get really good grades and an undergraduate research position in a lab. Then comes the masters. In the US, it takes 1-2 years to complete, some schools offer the undergrad+masters combo (5years total) and thats a non thesis masters. \n\nSo I can\u2019t speak for any other fields, but even in engineering there are a lot of factors that determine how long it takes to finish. That means professors, funding, and research. Every professor is different so it\u2019s important you find one that will want to get you out as soon as possible. Funding is a huge issue that I see even within my department, some PhDs will not have enough funding to complete their research because their PI doesn\u2019t have the funds. Lastly, research can be very time consuming depending on what field you want to go into. In my engineering department, there are different research groups and we have one group working on engine research. I found out that the engines group\u2019s PhD students take 5-6 years to complete their degree while other groups usually take 4 years.\n\nYou\u2019re still young, I\u2019ve seen PhD candidates that are older (30s-40s) that come back after working in industry and its normal.

I attend conferences and educational meetings to keep up with advances and trends in the field and to network. There are a multitude of other projects I help with, as well.

I am proud of myself for that - I know it's really difficult to have a smooth thesis writing process. I'd say that you should be proud of yourself, too. Every individual has different work habits. Writing for the whole night doesn't equal to a good amount of good quality work. I can only work 3-4 hours a day in the evening because I'm a night person. I know that I can't work for a whole day/night or I'd have a not-so-good written work. I hope you see my point.\n\nAppreciate your every achievement. Even a taking good break is an achievement.

That\u2019s my passion :)\n\nMSL jobs are everywhere since you\u2019re based out of your home, but it\u2019s important to live near a major airport. (Side note \u2014 the flight miles add up too. I haven\u2019t paid for flights for a vacation in a long time, and I often get free upgrades to first class.) As an MSL, you\u2019re responsible for a region/territory. So if you live in NYC you might cover the tristate area or the northeast US. If you\u2019re in Canada, there are also MSL jobs there (just in case this applies to you). \n\nEvery pharma and biotech company will have MSL teams dedicated to specific products, a portfolio of products, or a therapeutic area. My team is dedicated to one product with application across multiple therapeutic areas, which I find challenging but rewarding and interesting. If you have an interest in specific diseases, you should see if you can focus your PhD in that area to give you specialty knowledge for when you enter the job market. But you also won\u2019t be excluded from jobs just on the basis of your specialty. For example, my PhD therapeutic area is pain medicine, but I currently work as an MSL in more of an immunology space. \n\nGetting your foot in the door is the hard part, but if you\u2019re thinking about it now you\u2019ll be ahead of the game. Internships definitely help, and your college career center should be able to help you. The other part is research. See if there are projects you can join at school. If you can start presenting at conferences and honing your public speaking skills in that way, it will be so valuable. Networking is a HUGE part of it too. Part of the MSL role is being able to network and build relationships, so it only makes sense that this is helpful when it comes to landing the job. Do you mind if I ask where you are (geographically)? You can DM me if you don\u2019t want to blast that out to Reddit. I can try to direct you to companies and people. \n\nThe good thing is, once you get your first MSL job, you\u2019ll have recruiters contacting you weekly about new opportunities.

I worry that my nervousness won't just make me looks silly, but also too lazy to prepare thoroughly\" --&gt; Personally, I think that being nervous is primarily stemming from the character of a person and his/ her level of experience with such situations. If an applicant with a brilliant track record comes into an interview and stutters, I definitely would not blame under-preparedness as the root cause for the nervousness. I would rather think that it's very important to the person, that the person probably hasn't been often in similar situations, or that the person is simply the kind of person that gets nervous. In the worst case (and this is very speculative), I would probably think that the nervous candidate lacks real life experience outside of Academia. However, none of these factors would make me assume that you are a bad candidate for the job. Also keep in mind, the interviewer was probably at least once in a similar situation and has seen many other candidates with similar issues. \n\nAbout the \"selling yourself point\": Yes, you have to sell yourself. But you have to sell yourself in every job. If you are a Yoga teacher, you have to fill daily your Instagram channel with some pseudo-wholesome wisdom about life balance, if you are a researcher in a company you have to sell your ideas to your boss, if you are a consultant you have to sell your client that your solution is great and unique. The difference between these types of selling and selling yourself in the Academic community is the objectivity of evaluation criteria that are imposed upon you. I am not the most experiences Academic, but - based on my experience - I haven't encountered a case that people wouldn't buy into your results because someone was a bad sales man, even though the results were sound. People will in the first place judge the quality of your work. If you have a great data set, people are going to acknowledge it. If you have results that withstand qualitative rigour, people are going to acknowledge it (sooner or later). There are of course examples when great research is shot down because it doesn't suit someone.

(Someone chime in if you have other thoughts.) For a tenured professor, you would be expected to secure grants, run a lab, train students in research and do the regular teaching/lecturing stuff. It can be very rewarding, as a lot students never feel like they get a true mentor in college, especially if their professors are more focused on research. Of course, you can also be a lecturer without doing research, and the pay is more similar than you would expect.

You might be expected to work on a team on a major project or independently developing ideas. Again, very much depends on type of institution.  And just like academia, there are admin options.\n\nNonprofit work: Nonprofits need researchers to verify that what they're doing actually matters.  As a researcher on board, you would likely advocate for the nonprofit's mission.  You'd provide the evidence they need to secure funds, inform policy change at the political level and directly impact those benefiting from the nonprofit's work. \n\nI have jumped around an awful lot in my education (visual art, psychology, neuroscience...), but I've recently turned my PhD interests toward Science Communication for the same reasons you listed above.

It's pretty rare, but it's very ideal financially as you are getting paid a salary while also getting a PhD. The drawback to this though is it usually comes with a period of time where you are obligated to stay at your company or pay some penalty of sorts. Additionally, most companies only offer this to you if you work for a while and they really like/trust you. The other downside is the experience of a PhD student. You don't spend as much time on campus, which means you miss a lot of the experiences ( positive and shitty) that contribute to high quality scientists and engineers.

Good luck, I believe in you, you CAN do this, and you will!\n\nEdit: spelling", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ewi012/i_have_two_weeks_to_submit_my_thesis_and_i_am/fg30h14/"}, "2130": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "psychmancer", "Date": 1580467492, "Score": 4, "Body": "Since I've never heard of someone getting kicked off a PhD, well done", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ewhsd7/first_in_my_family_to_get_kicked_out_of_a_phd/fg32lxn/"}, "2131": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Downtown_Perspective", "Date": 1580467932, "Score": 2, "Body": "It's impossible to predict specifics and a waste of time trying to.
