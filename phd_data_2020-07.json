Some colleagues who are sponsored by industrial partners (not an EngD, which is longer) have similarly obtained more like \u00a320,000 with no benefits, but also work for their industrial partners one day a week and have to deal with the company constantly asking them to do the research they need.

I don't take expensive holidays or live in a fancy apartment but I have enough to visit friends, go drinking, take 1 holiday a year etc. Normal student lifestyle I guess and I have made some savings.

When I first started teaching (not at a university, at a language school in my home country teaching English) I sucked badly and I knew it. I sucked because I had no former experience, some of the students were simply bad people and I didn't know how to handle them. I would get nervous every time I stepped in to a classroom. And I made many mistakes. Like I played an episode  from a TV show I liked (for the purpose of exposing them to relevant content) which turned out to have sexually explicit scenes. The students were fine with this stupid mistake but for weeks it ate me inside. How could I be this reckless and not check the stuff before having students watch it? Such an embarrassment. And quite a few other mistakes that only an inexperienced teacher would make. In the end, except for a few students who thought I was at least trying so hard to do my job, they all rated me poorly. \n\nBut as I said, I learned from my mistakes. Two years from that semester, I was much more confident, much better at my job, much better at communicating with students and handling them if they caused trouble. I started getting emails from former students saying I was a big impact on them in multiple ways. \n\nNow I am sure I'd also struggle teaching in my second language and it is only so normal that you have. But as I said do not repeat the same mistake and move on. Do not leave your comfort zone regarding speaking English for a while. Make sure you know what things you say mean in all respects. As you get more confident you'll get much better at communicating your thoughts in a more genuine way even in your second language. \n\nAs for your publication: I am in no position right now to judge how \"rubbish\" your work actually is but when you are faced with so many difficult situations all at once you are likely to underestimate yourself and your work.

So run your jokes by some peers or your advisor to see what they think. Observe what *your* favorite teachers do in class and copy that.

I\u2019m an older student, 31, attempting to finish my bachelor\u2019s degree in Biotech/Chemistry/Microbiology. I have stopped studying multiple times during the years and retaken studies only recently. During my off time I had the opportunity of being a teacher/assistant professor in Math and Science in a private school and university (mainly highschool and 1st/2nd year undergrad students). I\u2019ve had a little experience as an research assistant and worked for a while on my own project. Now that THAT has been said, let\u2019s talk. \n\nAs a teacher, you will never make EVERYONE happy and that is okay. Your main focus is to transmit the information and knowledge necessary for the course to your students while using your own experiences and advanced knowledge to add useful advice here and there. The way you teach your class is your decision. You can be a very strict, no jokes, no bullshit, mechanical professor or a more lax and relaxed one. In either case some people will always complain. The key is to focus on your main objective: are you transmitting the necessary knowledge effectively? If yes then don\u2019t think about it too much. Read and analyze the student\u2019s feedback, modify your approach based on it with the main objective stated above in mind and watch your ass with what you say. There\u2019s always room to improve and you will not be perfect the first or even the second time you do things. As for the language barrier, practice, practice and more practice. The cultural differences will sort themselves out as you interact with more people, you can even express this point of view with your colleagues and students and get to know how your approach to studying and evaluations differ from theirs, always with the goal of improving. I would bet you ate not necessarily totally in the wrong like you think. \n\nAs for the PhD work... I\u2019m probably not the best person to give advice here but will give you my heartfelt opinion. YOU ARE A PHD STUDENT. That means you have overcome a great deal of hurdles already. You were accepted into your program because you met the necessary requirements to do so. You have reached this middle point already, that means that YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES to finish it. I think that overcoming the stage you are in right now is the critical part. Just now you have acquired the necessary knowledge and experience to realize just how steep the hurdle you must overcome is. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING, it means that you have matured in your studies enough to understand what you need to do to acquire your goals. You are growing, and growth is usually slow and not always painless. Do not be discouraged by your paper not being accepted. This is an opportunity to REALLY learn. You say they gave you detailed feedback, that\u2019s great! Use it! Criticism in the scientific field is not like other areas. These are people who know their stuff and they are telling you where you made mistakes, not for the sake of hurting you, but for you to take in this knowledge and use it to become better. My PI told me once than we you wrote proposals or paper it was a matter of trial and error. You wrote, got rejected, learned, modified and tried again. It is okay not to be perfect. I don\u2019t believe anyone expects you to be, perhaps only yourself. Take pride in what you\u2019ve accomplished, I don\u2019t know you and I\u2019m proud and a little jealous of where you are. Haha. Keep your course, don\u2019t doubt yourself so much and focus on the fact that you are growing everyday. What lies ahead are simply more opportunities for growth. \ud83d\ude0a", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hjgghu/i_just_received_excruciating_student_feedback/fwm9uqo/"}, "155": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "BelgaerThinker", "Date": 1593633597, "Score": 36, "Body": "I feel this so hard right now.

This does not have to be true in your case. But realizing this, I talked all the time and listened to radio and television shows to adopt regional speech patterns, rhythm and colloquialisms.

For a regular activity, honestly more than 2-3 h per week is too much, especially if OP has any other non-research program requirements like TA requirements, formal courses, or weekly seminars with required attendance. Once in a while, I could see  (and in my own experience have seen) somebody spend several hours of a week helping a colleague with a manuscript/poster/presentation but it\u2019s usually a one-off for one or two weeks until the thing is finished and only happens every few months. Even then, the person usually helps because they\u2019re a co-author, or associated with the project in some way, or a trusted friend of the person who doesn\u2019t mind proofreading for their labmate. \n\nThe vast majority of a PhD student\u2019s time should be spent on their own research project so that they can get the pubs they need to move forward with their career post-graduation and don\u2019t take 10 years to do it. Period. It\u2019s not the student\u2019s job to proofread and edit everything  that leaves the lab, that\u2019s the PI\u2019s job. It\u2019s the PI\u2019s job to ensure every output that leaves their lab is up to their specs. Not only is this PI failing OP by distracting them from their project with busywork, but he is also failing the other students who are authoring the documents that OP is reviewing. Those students should be taught how to write their own documents and then go through the proofreading/editing process with the PI with the goal of ensuring that they can independently produce high quality scientific writing by the time of their graduation. They should not be awarded a PhD in science if they can\u2019t produce a publishable manuscript without handholding by the time they graduate. \n\nIf I were in OP\u2019s situation, first I would ask if I could get out if it entirely, stressing the need to work on my own project. If that doesn\u2019t work, I would ensure that I was very visibly busy working on my own project  and I would just say, I\u2019m very busy trying to get these experiments (x,y,z, etc.) done, I can give you a couple hours this week to review documents. And then I\u2019d let what I couldn\u2019t get done in that amount of time pile up. Pretty soon, people will realize that their shit is held up and they\u2019ll realize if they want it finished by a certain deadline, they\u2019ll have to do it themselves or find someone else who can help them proofread and edit. I think if OP keeps spending so much time helping other people they\u2019re going to start running into problems of their own, like their committee wondering why they haven\u2019t made very good progress recently and they could possibly face severe repercussions like dismissal from the program for stuff like that. \n\nI would recommend forging ahead on your own project and being very assertive. Stressing the timeline that you\u2019d like to graduate in and how many pubs you\u2019d like to your PI and making plans and serious efforts to meet that timeline and those goals. Give him a strong shock to the system and he may realize he can\u2019t do this to OP and them still graduate with 4 pubs by spring 2023 or whatever their timeline and goals are. Be disagreeable. I suffer from being agreeable and accommodating and also tend to be handed busywork for those reasons. \n\nAnd start documenting. Documenting what you do with your time and keep those emails and communications of when you were asked to help proofread stuff or document if you were verbally asked.

Exactly how you could go about this is highly dependent on your field, lab, funding, etc, but here are they key points of what I've done:\n\nFirst, I was able to learn a lot of methods - all these methods serve my dissertation research, so it's all in service of one primary project, but for me having a wide variety of techniques to do and data to analyze makes it feel less like I'm focusing on one specific thing. For example, I've spent a good deal of time becoming really proficient at bioinformatics, histology/microscopy, and some in vivo work. Jumping between these helps me a lot when I feel like I'm starting to stall on any specific experiment. Between me using a wide range of tools and pulling in a couple key collaborators, I've managed to publish 2 first author papers, and I'm currently working on a 3rd which will be submitted before the end of the calendar year. This gives me 3 solid dissertation chapters, so all I'm left with is writing an overarching introduction and that's the dissertation taken care of.\n\nSecond, I'm really lucky to be in a highly collaborative environment, and I've kind of established myself as the \"resident expert\" for those key techniques. By bringing my expertise to other projects, I have collaborated both with others in my lab, and a couple other labs that we work closely with. Obviously it is critical that this is done with your mentor's approval, especially considering funding, but it let me have multiple things to contribute to, and it can be great for publications too! I have 1 mid-authorship pub from my first \"in house\" collab, a couple weeks back another lab I collab with submit a paper where I'm second author, and there are 4 papers in my lab that I'm second author on in various stages of prep/submission. Some of my publication record is luck of course, like some key experiments and animal breeding went smoothly, and I'm so lucky to have such wonderful people in lab lab/institution.

My field is ecology/natural resourses. I\u2019m going to go step by step:\n\nSpring-Summer prior to applying: I looked up a list of R1 (that is, research 1 or research-oriented institutions) universities. I added all of the schools that had a natural resources/forestry/ecology program to a spreadsheet. I added columns for geographic location, town name, program websites, and potential advisors. If you are in ecology, professors with their own labs expect prospective grad students to contact them prior to applying to ask about the lab and see if there is room/funding to take on a new grad student. I added names of profs I thought I might enjoy working with to the spreadsheet, and links to their labs so I could find them again easily. I took the GRE in March.\n\nSeptember: Began contacting professors with whom I wanted to work based on my interests in their research. I started with those that I had most in-common with and who fit in the geographic areas I was most interested in moving to for school. I wrote up a CV and a template for emailing professors, which I personalized for each individual prof.\n\nOctober-November: Had several informal conversations with professors either via phone or zoom, probably talked to about 10 professors in all that had funding and were looking to recruit students. During this time I also refined what I was looking for in a program, and started writing ideas down for my application\u2019s personal statement. \n\nNovember-December: Completed applications. I eventually chose to apply to 4 programs, all to work with professors who I had talked to and/or met before applying. In my field, you apply to work with a specific mentor, so the previous contact allows them to fight for you during the decision process on the school/department\u2019s end.\n\nJanuary-February: Heard back from programs and attended interview weekends, started to compare programs to make a final decision.\n\nMarch: Accepted a PhD offer, heading to school this fall.\n\nResources I found helpful:\nThe Dynamic Ecology blog, the GradCafe Q&amp;A forums, friends who are currently grad students, google. \n\nFeel free to PM if you have any questions", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hl9k53/transitioning_from_environmental_consulting_to_a/fwxvbzv/"}, "472": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "LostRefuse", "Date": 1593898077, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thank you so much!

People who don't do it don't understand how fucking frustrating it is. A few tips I wish I knew ahead of time:\n\n\\- Give yourself way more time off than you think you need. Seriously, even with the deadline. Because first, your health will thank you, second, your brain would love a quiet and peaceful place so that it can do its things and put everything that you've been working on into context. Make sure this rest is real rest. Like going into nature or to a different town/city.\n\n\\- Reread all of your notes and look for different parts along the way where you could have taken a slightly different direction. Try following that line of thought and see if you can find anything new.\n\n\\- Keep constant watch for brand new papers that can support/negate your theory. I have both Scopus and Google Scholar set up to email me based on a bunch of criteria.\n\n\\- Altered states. Highly recommend, especially at the very end of a solid break when you're nice and rested. Weed as a first-line approach, as it can get the thoughts going in good ways. Just have a pen and paper ready. Maybe beforehand write out some general goals and objectives but don't have too many expectations. Next up is Adderall or really any stimulant. They will help speed up your thoughts and may lead you down new areas of thought. Finally, and of course, the psychedelics. Tread lightly, of course, do your research, set and setting, etc. Have a trusted trip sitter. Make a fun event out of it. Again, no expectations but some goals and see where the altered states can take you. I had a massive research breakthrough on a mushroom trip in my 2nd year. Like I am talking, went from months of pushing and pushing with no luck, to suddenly everything making sense, and my whole project was roughly mapped out and things made sense. Life-changing mate, let me tell you. Other drugs might help but I'll stop at that. Disclaimer, of course, drugs are powerful things, be careful please if you do take this advice.\n\n\\- Be more kind to yourself. No need to beat yourself up for struggling with something that is really fucking hard. Its loveless work my friend, so be good to you. This is but a blip in your life.\n\n\\- Be persistent and keep on pushing forward! Make lists of small things to do and try to do a few a day! Remember that if you are stuck, you need to back up and try a different approach. Being totally stuck yet continuing to try the same thing won't get you anywhere.\n\n\\- Take lots of walks. This goes with point 1, but I always spread my workday around a few neighborhood walks. No phones, no music, just me and my thoughts about the research. Often come back with new ideas.\n\n\\- Finally, and this might be most important, take great focus on the fundamentals of whatever field you are in. A lot of times early researchers gloss over the fundamentals and go straight for the research niche or more advanced topics. Trust me, the better you understand the fundamentals, the better of a researcher you become. You can read all the super-specific papers in the world and be nothing without the base of fundamental knowledge. Also, challenge ideas that are accepted, even if they are rather fundamental! Maybe somewhere along the way, a wrong idea was accepted and it led to a place in which people, like you doing the research, are finding themselves to be stuck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that's all I got. Good luck friend! You aren't alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: one other thing, when it comes down to it and that deadline is killing you, fuck that deadline. I had to drop out of a conference because my model wouldn't work and it killed me, but pretty shortly after I had my breakthrough and ended up eventually presenting it at a more appropriate conference (like a whole year later).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hlcycg/i_have_a_deadline_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/fwz6qaw/"}, "509": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "kgdk53", "Date": 1593931915, "Score": 25, "Body": "Yeah.

I think it's fair to say a higher number of people than average can be found doing PhDs and working in research-in many ways it can be a friendly environment for those of us on the spectrum-but it's often *massively* exaggerated.

It sounds like you have a pretty serious case of it, and I definitely think you\u2019ll want to see the GP and maybe talk to your University\u2019s counselling services. (These can be a bit bit and miss between different unis, but def worth a shot.)\n\nThat said: Please don\u2019t feel like a failure for this. A lot of us have gone through a similarly sucky period, where you feel lost, and like you\u2019ll never finish. I can only imagine what it must be like with a pandemic and lockdown altering your plans too.\n\nThe good thing about many of us going through this, is that you\u2019re not alone. Posting here is a good first step to clarifying your feelings, and finding some peer support. Are there any other PhD students in your lab, or in your social group? Reaching out to them might be a good second step, as they\u2019ll be closer to your situation, and more familiar with you and your department.\n\nMany PhD students find themselves in your situation, and eventually get through. The amount of work can be super daunting, but is less scary if you divide it up into smaller tasks that you can take one at a time. If you get stuck writing, start writing something that you are a bit more keen for. (I started my thesis by writing the Acknowledgments; it feels like you accomplished something, which can motivate you to write more, and it\u2019s an easier thing to write. Methods sections can also be easier, as it\u2019s a lot of just summing up what you did. I only wrote the thesis Introduction as one of the last things.)\n\nSome general mental health tips: Try to get your sleep rhythm in order. No phone or other distractions in bed. If you can\u2019t sleep, get out of bed, do some book reading, get back in bed. Set bed times and rise times, and keep to them.\n\nFinally, and most importantly: don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. A PhD is tough in the best of times, and you\u2019re trying to do it during a pandemic. It\u2019s OK to feel anxiety about the situation. Take a break if you can\u2019t work, and don\u2019t feel bad about taking them. They\u2019re an investment in your mental health, which is never a bad thing.\n\nIn practical terms: def respond to your supervisors. Let them know that you\u2019re struggling to work during lockdown. They might have some advice. Some supervisors are incredibly supportive, and others... well, not so much. How much personal stuff you\u2019ll want to share is likely dependent on how supportive your supervisors are. Being unproductive during a pandemic is very normal, and you should definitely be able to share that, and ask for their advice. The same is true for advice on how to change your PhD\u2019s path to accommodate for pandemic-induced issues.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hltaa4/advice_needed_second_year_phd/fx1fslx/"}, "585": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "salondijon8", "Date": 1593987512, "Score": 7, "Body": "Unfortunately a lot of the feelings you are describing are all too common for ph.d. students. The first thing I want to tell you is that every single academic has (at least at some point in their career) panicked over how little they\u2019ve accomplished and how much work they still have to do. Academics (especially ph.d. students) experience immense pressure to succeed at the expense of our mental and physical health. Eventually if we stay in this field, we all have to find a way to make peace with that pressure and not let the guilt and insecurities that come with it it rule our lives. In a way, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re realizing this now so you can develop the tools to manage it early in your career. I had some really rough stuff happen in my personal life in the first year of my doctorate, and now that I\u2019m almost done, I\u2019m actually grateful it happened. That experience taught me that sometimes I just don\u2019t have the mental energy to work or meet a deadline. I was forced to learn how to say no to things I couldn\u2019t handle, how to ask for help, and how to accept that I won\u2019t always make everyone happy or meet their expectations for me. I now realize how valuable those skills are and how few people talk about them in our field. \n\nThe second thing I want to tell you is that if you\u2019re experiencing depression or anxiety (which is also way too common for grad students) you should definitely try to see someone. I\u2019ve definitely struggled with it throughout my time in grad school, and seeing a therapist who also has a ph.d. has actually been really helpful since they really understand the situation (I\u2019m in the US so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s common for mental health professionals to have ph.d.s like it is here). You are a person first and scholar second, so taking care of your self and prioritizing your mental health is one of the best things you can do to improve your research. \n\nThe third thing I can say from my personal experience is that many grad students undergo periods of productivity and inspiration, as well as periods where they\u2019re burnt out and unproductive. I had a few months when I was my finishing my 2nd year when I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do more than the bare minimum, and it killed me to know I wasting valuable time to prepare for comps. I had another period right after I passed my comps where I was so burnt out from studying for them I couldn\u2019t make brain do any more work. Both times, I gradually got my energy back. Sometimes all it took was finishing a project I was tired  of and getting to work on something new. Other times I just need a few weeks/months where I wasn\u2019t using my brain as hard. I\u2019ve come to realize these are just part of the academic life cycle, and all you can do is your best in the moment. One thing that\u2019s also helped me in those periods is finding something completely NON-academic to do as a hobby. I know it may seem counterproductive to take time a way from your studies, but spending a few hours every week accomplishing something with my hands has been so great for my research productivity. I took up baking but I have some other colleagues who woodwork, paint, make jewelry, build lamps, cycle, hike, teach yoga, etc. Self control/self discipline isn\u2019t a muscle - it\u2019s more like a jug of water. We only have a finite amount and sometimes we have to stop working and refill it before we can productive again. Find something that refills your water jug and do it as much as you can! \n\nThe last thing is that I want to remind you we are in the middle of once in century pandemic, truly experiencing \u201cunprecedented and uncertain times,\u201d as every university email will remind you. So it\u2019s no wonder you can\u2019t focus on your work!! Who could expect you to when there are so many other things going on this year that need your energy and attention?? Cut yourself a little slack! As a grad student,  there are so many people trying to mold you, train you, exploit you, pressure you, etc. The least we can do is be kind to ourselves. Sometimes you are the only person who will be. So don\u2019t be hard yourself because you\u2019re not producing at the level you hoped right now or you\u2019re not achieving some expectations you set for yourself. You are trying to do a very hard thing, and now the world has given you some even harder circumstances. Be proud that you\u2019ve made it this far! Try rewarding yourself every day, no matter what you accomplished for school, by setting aside some time to treat yourself to one nice thing (a hike, a bath, a pastry, some trash tv, etc.) You\u2019ve earned it just by being you and getting though the day :) \n\nSorry for the long response!

You could be hitting your head on a wall trying to do something you've no interest in when you could do something else, that could be less productive than the ideal thing, but you're not doing anyway.

I do agree with this poster, however, in the fact that a \"gender reading\" of a Medieval text is not really very cutting edge. It's extremely difficult to get into any Humanities PhD because the job market is terrible and there is limited funding. Some cohorts are as small as 4/5 new students each academic year. You'll also be competing with students who have master's degrees and theses having already developed a strong area of focus and approach to their work. As an English PhD student who also works a bit with gender, I've had to really work to articulate a \"new\" reading of the literature I study with a gender angle, just because there is a lot of it. With the risk of sounding rude, I also take some issue with your assertion that women's history is told from the 19th century on -- there are dozens of well-known scholars who work on early modern and medieval literature with a gender angle, some who have been publishing for decades. From my limited experience with both early modern and medieval, I would be very surprised if there is not already a book or several books on the topic you describe.

I verbally said 4 in class and on my slides, but of course some students turned in 3-page essays. I had to confess to the head professor and adjust everybody's grades because of my mistake. There were very few assignments in the class, so several people got different grades than they would have originally gotten because of my typo.\n\nIn the second semester, a student emailed me to ask about his final exam grade after official grades were posted. I looked at his exam and realized I had miscounted the points. Instead of having a B+ in the class, he really deserved an A-. I had to fess up again. The head prof had to go through a lengthy and inconvenient grade change process to fix the student's grade.\n\nBoth cases were very stressful and the professor was not happy with me in either situation. However, he was understanding. I just try to remind myself that I am a student too, and that the reason we are not full professors is because we make these kinds of mistakes when we are learning. As someone else pointed out, you won't make this mistake again. As long as your mistakes don't become habits, you should be okay.

If you have that, your chances will improve a lot. Without that, it's gonna be a lot harder. \n\nI didn't find the research track you plan to apply to, and that makes it a little harder to evaluate too. Research fit is usually extremely important. I don't know what are your research interests, but you need to check how many of those schools would be aligned with your interests. Even if your application is very strong, it may not matter that much if the fit is bad. \n\nGenerally speaking, work experience doesn't matter that much. So, your 10 years of experience will not have much of a weight. \n\nTeaching experience has some value, but I didn't see any of that in your profile.\n\nYou will also need to have some convincing explanations for the change in your career. \n\nCompetition for business PhD programs is fierce. Depending on the track you're choosing, schools usually accept only one student for that track each year.

But it's not easy at all, you gotta be ready to be really spartan about the way you live if your only source of income is your stipend. Stipends are usually for one person to live in moderate comfort, not a family. \n\n5 -  I would say it's not realistic at all. We are expected to focus on the PhD. You may be required to really work a lot. It's not always like that, but there were periods where I worked more than 12 hours a day. It would be impossible to work with something else simultaneously without a significant drop in my performance. \n\nAnd I believe a lot of advisors will not like to see you working, even if you think it's realistic.

You can also look for a supervisor (a professor in your field), and then apply for a right to pursue a PhD and then either apply for a salaried position where you're an employee for the university and university pays for your salary, or secure funding from elsewhere. At least in my uni and faculty, the study right application process is a twice a year thing: one in September when you can also apply for a salaried position, and one in February when you can only apply for the study right. You want to start contacting potential supervisors at least 6 months before applying for the study right, because you need to have a research proposal and a supporting statement from you supervisor when you apply. Also depending on the field, there might be only a few salaried positions available per year, so it can be really hard to get one of them. Sometimes a supervisor might have enough funding for their research project and they can pay a PhD student's salary from their funding as well. For example, when I went through all this, my (then future) supervisor offered me an opportunity to do a PhD related to one of his research projects in November, we figured out the details regarding the research plan and everything else, and I then applied for both the study right and a salaried position next September.

It is not necessary to have results twice every week. You can also just mention what happened in that week.\n\nOne of the things that you can do is to define targets clearly. Communicate and agree on  those targets with your supervisors (perhaps weekly, but also for longer timelines). You mentioned that they are not happy that you did not achieve F. But was it a goal to finish it in that week? I would suggest to spend time in planning your future (timeline ranging from a week to the end of your PhD) and setting clear milestones. Do not be optimistic when you do this, but be realistic. Then negotiate this plan with your supervisors. If they demand more, do not agree to appease them, but rationally explain why something would take so much time. In an ideal scenario you reach your goals every week. In a realistic scenario, you might still fall short -- planning is hard and there are many uncertainties in research. Then you explain the process as suggested by [campbell363](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hr7koj/so_my_supervisors_are_sucking_my_will_to_live/fy2pngj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)[ below](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hr7koj/so_my_supervisors_are_sucking_my_will_to_live/fy2pngj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).  I can't say if this will work with your supervisors. They might not be open to such discussion, or be willing to negotiate the targets. Then you can involve a third party to resolve the issue.\n\nThe following is something very dependent on your personal outlook and what your goals are: treat your PhD as a job. Do not work over weekends, it your time off. Work the amount of time that you agreed upon. If something is not doable within that time, it is mostly because it takes more time, and change your targets.\n\nFinally, if you feel burnt, don't push, take time off.

When I hand-delivered the copy of my thesis I joked with my friends (we all went together) that the dean should have been there with a glass of sherry and a sort of \"well done lads\" pat on the back. As anticlimactic as it was to hand over the materialization of 5 years of my life to a grumpy office worker in the darkest corners the building, it only got worse in the following months.\n\nHOWEVER, once I got over the feeling that I was owed something and regarded the PhD not so much as a ticket to open special doors, but more as proof to myself (and the world) of my resilience and tenacity, things got better. I also started some new hobbies to keep my mind occupied during this time, but that might be a bit harder now with COVID. \n\nMy advise would be to remain open-minded about your career options; there's a lot of scope to work on research outside the academy. In my case I took a position that didn't require a PhD at all (I felt lucky to get anything), but after about a year a new position was created for me since my boss recognized the value of having someone with research skills in a senior role.

You\u2019ve got to learn how / train yourself to get in (&amp; out) of that state. My trick was fairly simple: my goal for the day was to start - I didn\u2019t have a word or time count to work towards, but I had to start (and try to get into that state). That way on the \u201cgood\u201d days I could work/write all day and on days I got into the state and it didn\u2019t last - I could let myself stop. That level of routine worked for me - but time chunks where I had to \u201caccomplish\u201d certain things were basically impossible for me. I\u2019d underestimate how long something took and be off schedule by 9am and it would throw everything off.\n\nNext up: minimize distractions that will get you out of that state. Find a place to work that won\u2019t have external things constantly distract you (like not a common room of a shared apartment). I had to tell my roommates/partner to not interrupt me unless it was very important. I had to shut off notifications and emails and such. I could NOT use the pomodoro method because the constant interruptions for breaks were so jarring they gave me all this anxiety. The goal is to get in that lovely hyper focus state and stay there until you\u2019re done, not until some external factor distracts you and then you can\u2019t do anything anymore because it was so jarring to be pulled from the state. Then, when you\u2019re done you can gently remove yourself and continue on your day.\n\nNext up: make sure you\u2019re eating and taking care of yourself. This is when you may have to set up reminders and such - even an alarm to tell you to eat. I would make sure to eat before working, have snacks at my desk so I could stay in my state and maybe remember to eat, and the had reminders/alarms to remind me if things got too far. Also reminders to go to bed, etc. When I had these basic reminders set up it was easier to not constantly worry that I was forgetting something important and gave me the space to think. But I didn\u2019t add too many so as not to disrupt myself from a state.\n\nAlso for writing: I wrote very basic outlines but with a word count so that I couldn\u2019t go crazy on things. So instead of \u201cwrite lit review\u201d it was \u201cwrite a 1500 word lit review with 750 words on this more important lit and 500 on this lit and 250 words tying it all to my argument\u201d. That helped me not write chapters that were super long and meandered everywhere and were so overwhelming I couldn\u2019t ever get them \u201cdone.\u201d It basically cut down on \u201coverwhelmed and bad at organizing and constantly distracted\u201d appearing in my writing.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hs71mt/post_mental_illness_burnout_need_help_for/fy9dsj3/"}, "1808": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MFA_Nay", "Date": 1594913476, "Score": 4, "Body": "GitHub hosting, Jekyll theme (example: [Academic](https://jekyll-themes.com/academic/)) and a content management system (CMS) like Netlify or a very simple one like prose.io\n\nIf you use GitHub for hosting it makes sense to buy a custom domain and redirect your GitHub to that.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hs9s9g/template_for_a_personal_website/fy9ey23/"}, "1809": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ozshikh", "Date": 1594915885, "Score": 2, "Body": "Great!

This is great advice. Thank you. I am going to look into that app for other uses, but I don't think it's exactly what I am looking for? I do have similar methods via my notebook, sticky notes and mind maps. They help me collect my scattered thoughts and work much better for my brain than simple linear lists. I wrote a guide to some programs too and am going to add this one to it. You might find it useful: https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hatlla/software_for_working_with_an_adhd_brain/\n\nI like to think those with ADHD think radially, like a mind map. This causes problems when trying to translate this method of thinking towards simple tasks and more linear activities. Our brains are really, really good at making a lot of connections at once. This is great of you can harness it, but if you don't manage it it can be hard to communicate your thoughts and ideas because they appear all over the place, but they're really not. ADHD folk have that stigma of being \"omg so random lol\" for that reason. We just lose track sometimes because we can't keep track of all the ideas we have. I find mind maps much better than lists for this reason, though I depend on lists completely for basic tasks. I find them extremely useful for papers.\n\nMy problem is a bit more scheduling I think. I'm completely time blind and think I can do literally everything in a day. I have microscope work, lab work within COVID restricted hours, and I am writing a paper. I burnt out because I got injured and used to be a very active person and didn't replace that outlet. I am attempting to deliberately schedule in down time so I can go back to enjoying things while feeling accomplished about getting work done. I need something where I can break the tasks down for the week and see accomplishment over time. I want to make a positive feedback loop whereas now I am trying to do everything at once and it's having me trip over myself.\n\nThe way I have been working is as you described above, I am riding those waves and things I don't want to immediately do stagnate, because the work is endless as I am sure you are aware. This creates an unhealthy cycle where I am getting anxious about those things because I am chasing fires elsewhere but am inevitably being avoidant. I just moved into a new place with my own office and as you said, just giving yourself the space to do that is so useful and I've gotten so far from riding those waves but it's becoming impractical. I am trying to do all the things at different places because I inevitably avoid the things I need but don't want to do.\n\nAgain, this is in part a work productivity exercise and something to help me take better care of myself. I need time to unwind and if there are things hanging over me it's really hard.

You will make mistakes or finish and have a million ways to improve your research, that\u2019s the point.  \n\nWhile you have free time, pick out conferences to attend and journals to publish in.  Utilize doctoral colloquiums to improve your research.  I got to travel internationally 3x for free because I knew what conferees to go to, which had funding to pay for students to attend, and my program had extra funding as well.\n\nMake sure you have a place to study.  And when you study, actually work.  Turn off the phone, close email, just work.\n\nUse EndNote.  I love it!  It stores papers I\u2019ve read and updates citations for different formats. \n\nMake sure you take time for yourself.  You\u2019re human, make time to relax.\n\nRemember we are all on our own journey.  Some people finish in 3 years, some in 4, some take longer.\n\nLastly, you\u2019re never alone.  If you need help, reach out.  If things go bad, the worst thing you can do is isolate.

I read tweets by fantasy writers and scholars, I watch fantasy series on Netflix, I read articles that interest me about fantasy that have nothing to do with my project, I explore online interviews and lectures (University of Glasgow has a centre for fantasy research, and they\u2019ll begin adding more resources and videos online as part of that.) I find that it recharges me to do things that put me in the social and critical spaces of fantasy without feeling like I\u2019m working. Sometimes it\u2019s healing for me, and other times it even ends up motivating me to get back to work, but either way, it reminds me that this is a thing that I love even when my anxiety makes it hard to sit and read full fantasy books or actual research for my thesis. It\u2019s also a good reminder for me of the many non-academic jobs surrounding fantasy.\n\nPersonally, I think that if you don\u2019t have a clear, concrete idea of what else you want to do right now and you\u2019re funded, finishing the PhD allows you the flexible schedule to work on your mental health, get a qualification, and have money to live off of during a time when jobs are unstable and uncertain. If you\u2019re not concerned with being an academic, that\u2019s totally fine! Remember to separate yourself from the culture of overwork that can develop in PhD cohorts and remind yourself that you\u2019re not trying to achieve the same things that people trying to go into academia are. You\u2019re focused on developing skills, finding out what interests you, and spending time with things you\u2019re passionate about. I think there can be a tendency in PhDs to evaluate all PhD students by those things you need to do to make it academia, and it can be hard to find different ways of finding value and evaluating yourself if that\u2019s not your end goal. So it\u2019s important to constantly reminding yourself that you\u2019re on a different path and trying to do different things, and that\u2019s perfectly valid.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hswcy2/should_i_quit/fydcz39/"}, "1924": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "SimilarOrdinary", "Date": 1595001813, "Score": 3, "Body": "First, congratulations on getting to this point! It's a really big deal as a first-gen. college student. Not many people, at least for me, really recognize how tough that is.\n\nI wish I knew about Hugh Kearns' planning strategies early on. I'm in no way actually connected to the guy, I swear! But I did feel his advice would have been useful when I discovered his work in my last year. I felt that I'd been plopped into a whole new culture where I didn't understand any of the nuances throughout the whole thing. Now, I have a better sense, which is really annoying haha.\n\nA few things I learned in my experience (and pls keep in mind that every program and field will demand different things):\n\n* Network! Go to conferences and be nice to people. Get along with your colleagues. Sell yourself. Do what you can to be memorable. They'll be especially useful for when you graduate and need jobs/post-docs. and might offer publishing advice or other opportunities.\n* Everyone's right - Noone will hold your hand through this. Be persistent, but kind. Learn to manage yourself and to \"manage\" your supervisor. They have a lot to do already, they won't keep track of you unless you get extremely lucky. Meet with them regularly if you can so you can avoid mistakes early.\n* Professors are human too. They understand Imposter's Syndrome, they've watched their students struggle. They'll know when you're procrastinating. Don't be afraid to approach them with questions. And if they're dicks, well, you know who to avoid.\n* Try to set your research questions as early as possible. Take advantage of your courses to get a head start on your dissertation. You *will* learn that you could have done a lot of things differently throughout writing your diss and that's just a part of learning. Get it done, get out, move on with your life.\n* Know that you can say \"no.\" Advocate for yourself. You don't have to keep doing everything (like other projects) that people say you should also take on, unless it would legit. be a good idea.\n* Set up a good support and mental health system. Prep a good therapist. Keep connected with close friends/family. Colleagues are helpful b/c they'll \"get\" what you're going through.\n* You'll receive a lot of criticisms and rejections. Try not to take it personally and keep learning from them.\n* Try to set up a committee that will get along. Most, if not all, should be tenured. Your main reader/advisor should be someone you get along with - It will make all the difference. Try to add at least one hotshot in your field if possible. Just having the name attached looks nice.\n* Remember why you're doing this and use that as motivation. Toward the end, it might just be \"I've come too far, so I can't quit,\" and that's good enough. It's also not that unusual, in my experience. Of course, if you realize earlier that it's not for you, there's no shame in quitting if there's really no point in it. In fact, it's smart.\n* PhD is about persistence and stubbornness more so than intelligence (although that obviously helps). It really is a marathon, not a sprint, which is why planning and pacing yourself are so important.\n\nBest of luck!

SSRIs are notorious for making you feel worse before you get better, but I know a lot of people who they've helped, too. \n\nUnfortunately sometimes it's a long process to find the right med or combination of meds, but it's absolutely worth it when you do. \n\nIn my case, I've been clinically depressed since I was like 8 (yeah, I know) and only started seeing a psychiatrist in undergrad when I realized it was fucking up my relationship. I saw a therapist too, but when I pointed out that if it were gonna get better on its own it wouldn't have taken a decade lol they agreed to let me try medication. Which helped a *lot*. Unfortunately I'll probably never be off it, but a tiny pill a day is hardly a hefty price. Since antidepressants aren't a cure, you really do have to keep taking them, even if you feel better, otherwise you'll drop straight back down.\n\nOn the other hand, a good therapist is almost always just as important as the meds, if not more so, since they help you recognize problematic thought patterns and develop coping strategies for the future. They also help you identify and deal with any underlying issues that might be present-- for a lot of people, the meds are the stabilizers so they can fix underlying issues in the meantime. Finding the right therapist can be really difficult, too, though, and might take a while. But again, it's super worth it when you do.

There were 2 TAs so I got 93 and the other TA for 94.\n\nMonday and Wednesday were lecture days, but Friday\u2019s were discussion days that we had online in blackboard.\n\nIt was my job to lead and manage discussions in 19 different chat rooms of 5 people.\n\nMy advice:\n\nKnow the technology.  Whether you\u2019re in canvas or blackboard, know the system as best you can early.\n\nSetup a grading schedule.  My plan was to do 1/3 of the class per day.  If I felt energetic, I\u2019d do more and help myself in case I was exhausted the next day.  But make a plan and stick to it.\n\nDocument everything.  If a student had a question on an assignment, I\u2019d have them email me unless it was a yes/no answer.  It\u2019s hard keeping track of large classes and if a student messes up, they may blame you, so document interactions as much as possible.\n\nOnline components can be a juggling act.  If you\u2019re doing a discussion, don\u2019t post all the questions ahead of time, do them one at a time.  Otherwise, students see the questions, have two second conversations, and then say they did it all.  \n\nBe understanding.  If your program is in-person and had to change to online due to COVID, know that they didn\u2019t sign up for this.  Some students will email you more and love this and some will struggle.  Try to be as supportive as you can, but don\u2019t burn yourself out.\n\nIf you can, make assignments due by 5 pm aka business hours.  If something bad happens aka blackboard goes down, you can get technical support.  If stuff happens at midnight, you\u2019ll just be getting emails all night.\n\nAutomate what you can.  We had to take attendance at my university because we taught NCAA division 1 athletes who would frequently get drafted by the NFL.  I had students submit attendance via google forms with passwords for the day as evidence of their presence.  This beat calling names or signing papers and saved me hours at the end of the semester.  Work smart, not hard.\n\nIf you get overloaded, talk to the instructor.

Whereby, supervisors are either poorly matched to a project i.e. having no relevant experience, being too busy, not interested in the project, poor at being able to communicate properly etc... However this may encourage you as, when you reach the viva most examiners consider a thesis as a pass. If you understand the work, where your contributions are and thier significance pending a good methodology and thus appropriate experimental methods you should be fine. Remember a PhD is pass fail. You don't get extra marks for perfection. So my advice is get your head down figure out what your contributions are (even in your new direction) that you can realistically manage, why they are significant and that they are indeed contributions i.e. not covered in existing publications. And make sure that you definitively discuss *this* with your supervisor asking for advice on in specific items e.g. your aims and objectives to your thesis question and experiment plan. Also find a thesis that has passed but may be in a similar field of research as yours this may help identify just how much you may need to cover on the topic to get over the 'thesis is ready to be submitted' threshold. Once you do this, it should give you a lot of independence from your supervisor and you can focus on the most important thing. Finishing not perfection, finishing.  \n\nRemember in earnest, one of your supervisors main roles is quality control. He is not there to teach you about your subject. You have to decide what your thesis is about and just check in with him for quality control. This should come in the form of: you - \"I plan to do A B C\" him- \"A is not very accurate\".

From what I\u2019ve been told, the other students are completing their journal publications and dissertation in about 4 years.\n\nFunding is definitely something I will need to be get more information about. I set up a meeting with a professor to discuss my research proposal. I believe from talking with other students they\u2019ll provide me in-state tuition, but as far as funding I still need to discuss. It\u2019ll likely be based on if I am assisting with research I\u2019d presume.\n\nAs far as the remoteness is concerned, I have been to LSU before, my family went. I live about 4 hours away in Houston now. If needed, i work half day Fridays and could take off to drive to BR for lunch time appointments once a month. I go to Dallas which is same distance regularly. I\u2019d definitely take off time to go to BR on occasion just for long form reviews, presentations, etc. My work has given me some flexibility and funding with my MS, so I would not see this being different.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/htbvxr/distance_phd/fyi0mog/"}, "2088": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "amissy90", "Date": 1595110191, "Score": 3, "Body": "Congratulations!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/htfhcd/yeah_sex_is_good_and_allbut_have_you_ever/fyi3woz/"}, "2089": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "woofiegrrl", "Date": 1595113781, "Score": 4, "Body": "Have you googled this?

I just finished my first year... well, I'm about to submit my final assignment that is a month overdue. I have had a number of personal issues that have prevented me from being my most productive, but the pandemic has certainly made me feel like I'm sinking in quicksand. There is an anxiety/depression cycle that is a real problem for me, but we are not alone. To varying degrees, many people are similarly struggling.\n\nI realized that part of the issue (only part but a significant part) is lack of space, movement, and chosen study environment. Like you, I feel stifled at home. I think part of this is because I associate home with rest, and all the things associated with rest (bed, food, tv) are too available. I like to study in libraries and coffee shops. Getting out of my space gets me motivated, but the freedom to move from space to space is also part of my process. Thus, not only is my process disrupted, but i am stuck in the one place I have always struggled to make productive. \n\nTo try and resolve this issue, my siblings and I started a serious zoom study space for productivity. I'm lucky that all of my siblings are currently in grad programs and are needing the extra bit of motivation. Let me tell you our process... we agree on meeting times, log on and chat for a little bit, then we set a short term goal. We keep the audio on so we can hear each other, and we can see each other of course, but we are silent until the time limit is reached. From there, we take 5 and then set another goal. Usually, our short term goals run over because we become very productive and don't want to disrupt a good flow. \n\nHonestly, this solution has made all the difference. It isn't perfect, but just last night I went into our study meeting ONLY because I had previously agreed and didn't want to leave my sister hanging. I was unmotivated and tired. I set a mini goal to accomplish within the time frame and nearly completed my annotated bibliography by the end of the session. Our thirty minute goal turned into 2.5 hours of work. It isn't always that productive, but let me tell you, these zoom meetings have really saved me (and my siblings) this summer.\n\nFor you, it could be friends, or could try to start a new group. It does not have to be academics.

Make sure you have your supervisor's support in getting to the end of your path\n2. Look for a job/job placement/internship in your own field, try to relate the (new) source of your income to your PhD, this will allow you to include additional work into your thesis so it can be seen only as a plus\n3. Go talking with your head of school/student advisor and explain your problem and motivation, try to get a year of leave of absence due to financial reasons. This will avoid you paying the annual fees\n4. Apply yourself in finalising your work and wrapping up the thesis, don't forget to keep your supervisor engaged\n5. Go back to college, submit, and get your well deserved PhD title\nThis whole process involves a lot of effort, sweat and probably yelling. You'll work extra hours, doing two job, but getting money for half of it, but I can totally say that it pays off.

I've found that having someone to check in with regularly has helped keep my stress levels manageable and they help me to brainstorm solutions to problems I'm facing. Like someone else said, I don't think working harder is the answer here.\n\nSecondly, have you considered some medical leave? If you are research council funded you can receive 12 weeks paid absence and at my university you can suspended your studies for up to a year. Some time away without your PhD hanging over you might do some good. The disability services at your university may also be able to help you with this process.\n\nI agree with another poster about finding a clinical psychologist who specialises in CBT. This helped me massively and is very different from speaking to a university counsellor (who are more to offer support than help you get better). I can recommend \"The Feeling Good Handbook\" and podcast of the same name if you want some CBT based self help resources.\n\nPlease don't put yourself through any unnecessary suffering.

The way that I came to terms with it was by not driving myself mad trying to decide which one was better and whether I had made the right choice, but rather deciding that I would be ok either way, in either country.

So I feel you. \n\nIn my program, that \u201cdancing around the subject\u201d usually happens for one of two reasons: \n1) The professor assumes that I know everything that he knows and overlooks the fact that I need guidance. He might think, \u201chmm, this might actually be a good idea, I\u2019m curious to see how she will have moved it forward a few months from now.\u201d Basically, he forgot that I am a student I need him to teach me HOW to move it forward. \n2) he is busy investing in a different student and doesn\u2019t really care about my dumb idea. Why bother explaining to me why it is dumb when he can just focus on the better projects that he has going with more accomplished students? \n\nIn either situation, the solution looks the same which is to put in more work to both flesh out your idea on paper and communicate to the professor what you need from him or her. \n\nAcademics are really good at revising pieces of writing. So, if your idea was just a verbal one, even writing it down in a word document makes it seem more like the first document of a project instead of just words floating around in the air that aren\u2019t necessarily an idea. So I would recommend writing it down and then bringing a printed copy to that person or emailing it to them and asking them, \u201cwhat do you think of this idea?\u201c Then it triggers in their mind, \u201coh, I have a piece of work to respond to.\u201d It\u2019s like grading a paper or returning a manuscript with tracked changes. It\u2019s their job. (But prepare to cry...your tiny little paragraph of an idea or diagram of a model could get completely torn up...unfairly so since you were just asking for guidance, not Reviewer 2 level feedback...) \n\nIn addition to fleshing out your idea on paper, I would also recommend hashing out what you want from the professor. I think this has two parts: first, you have to tell the professor what your career goals are and why you even want to publish in this or that journal. Then, you have to clarify sort of how you want that professor to help you get to that goal. (Did you expect that professor to co-author with you? Give you recommended readings to strengthen your understanding of the topic? Refer you to potential coauthors? Contribute his or her thoughts about how they would change the idea to make it more likely to get into a desired journal?) Then go to them and ask, \u201cwhat do I do next?\u201d With your goals in mind they should be able to direct you then. \n\nThen follow up a million times. Every 1-3 days you can send a follow up email asking what\u2019s up. It depends on the norms of your department. You can push the boundaries though. No supervisors I know have ever complained about their students reaching out too much or being too proactive. (In other fields we are called \u201coverachievers.\u201d In academia we are always barely clearing the bar of minimum competency so yeah it never hurts to follow up annoyingly much.) \n\nIf it feels unnatural to be that demanding, just remember that your supervisor owes you supervision - that\u2019s their job. It\u2019s now your right and obligation to claim that training. You can be demanding/high-maintenance.

Your department chair and/or grad secretary may also know about it if the accommodations come out of their budget, but they are required to keep it confidential like it\u2019s HIPAA-protected. \n\nI would recommend that you prepare to advocate for yourself like heck. Have full confidence that you are capable of succeeding. You got in; you deserve to be there. You will also have to work more and/or harder than persons without disabilities, but being in a PhD program, you\u2019re already going to have to work so dang hard that you won\u2019t even notice the difference. Do not allow yourself to feel like an imposter, like, \u201coh no, what did I get myself into? I can\u2019t do this.\u201d Literally everyone feels that way at some point in academia (especially non-traditional students) but I\u2019m telling you know to not let it keep you from succeeding. You belong there. \n\nDo make every effort to get you documentation, whether that\u2019s your IEP from grade school or if there is an adult measurement that your Office of Disability Services has. You can ask for what other options you can provide for documentation. Get creative if they will let you. Having your learning disability documented with the university will help you at the times of your major hurdles (qualifiers, comps, class exams, etc.) to have a back-up of having the law on your side. You will be protected under ADA if you can get it documented, and that means that if your department is not compliant in some situation with providing your accommodations, you should get a do-over. That will at a minimum provide a sort of psychological safety net, hopefully. Furthermore, then you can request accommodations (it\u2019s really more like demanding than requesting) that you need, like the tutor you mentioned. And your university and/or department will have to pay for it. You are entitled to your accommodations. (Again, protected by law.) \n\nI am in the social sciences too and I believe stats is tremendously over-valued. The social sciences want to be more like the hard sciences so they overweight your stats education in a lot of R1s. Again, advocate for yourself like heck. If your advisor pushes you to take another stats course to make yourself more marketable or something, just remember the official course requirements for your degree-you\u2019re not obligated to go beyond that. If you don\u2019t want to get deeper into quant than your have to, you can go ahead and start marketing yourself now (within your department) as a \u201ccontent researcher\u201d or a theory person. \n\nAcademics at R1s are kind of like not normal humans (read: not diplomatic) and they can be very ableist (esp. with regards to psychological and brain-related disabilities). I just want to reiterate that I don\u2019t recommend disclosing your disability to people in your department or your field. I have been on both sides as a teacher providing accommodations and an employee requesting accommodations. My university\u2019s office for persons with disabilities does not recommend that anyone ever disclose the nature of their disability to their teachers, and I agree with them on that.

Or you can go private and it's all free/9 quid per prescription. The only deterrent to the NHS option first is the long 1-2 year waiting list unless urgent. You can be seen in a week going private. The NHS is great.

Apparently, she felt the same way in her time. Even if you do nothing with that PhD, it's still social/educational capital, which is especially helpful as a woman. At the very least, it's bragging rights, even though I'm sure at this point you couldn't care less about that. \n\nA few things helped me: 1.) Regular meetings with a trusted advisor who kept me accountable. Even if I got nothing done, I still met with her so that I could talk through what was going on. She helped me understand my own progress. Plus, I needed the guilt. 2.) An accountability buddy. A colleague who was close to the the same point in his/her writing and was willing to write with me online/in person so that I wasn't tempted to nap. Plus, we could bounce ideas off of each other. 3.) Writing a bunch of words down, not paying attention to grammar, citations, etc. just to get myself in the mindset of writing *something*. Or drafting and adding on to an outline. Then, I could edit later. 4.) Reading other articles that I might use for my diss. It at least helped me feel productive and helped give me insight for more stuff to add to my project.\n\nEven if your written product is kind of shitty, it just needs to get done and you'll feel SO relieved once it's over. Your defense doesn't even need to go that well, as long as you pass. Nobody will care. Your dissertation will not define who you are as a person. And you never have to look at your project again if you don't want. Push through the next couple of months and you'll have a lifetime of being a fancypants PhD and an advantage over a vast majority of other people when it comes to your education.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hwhgkm/near_the_end_but_no_motivation_help_me_find_some/fz0hewz/"}, "2665": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Dyingdyingdeath", "Date": 1595533604, "Score": 17, "Body": "Good luck!

I did my master's in Nanomaterials Science and Engineering from South Korea and currently intern in the same lab, but I will quit and move to another more diverse country for my PhD (couldn't move so far because of the closed borders since March, and decided to bear the burden of internship for the money). Firstly, language barrier is eternally present here. You may think that research is carried out in English so it won't be a problem, but here everything is done in Korean and at last they write paper with the help of google translate. Explaining things to an instrument operator is nearly impossible because of the language barrier, it's possible only if your labmate whose fluent in English volunteers to help you. Secondly, the social hierarchy in the Korean culture is so toxic, specially when you are not used to it because you come from a culture which is more relaxed. The second thing every person will ask you is how old are you, and even if you're 1 year younger than them, they expect you to highly respect them as in the military culture, irrespective of how ridiculous their personality will be. Being a foreigner you can get away with things, but you will be alone, which I think isn't a good atmosphere to produce quality research because research is all about discussing your findings, getting feedback and sharing new ideas. Thirdly, lab meetings are held in Korean, Korean students present their work in Korean and PI gives them feedback in Korean, whereas you will feel like you don't exist in the room. When it's your turn, you will present in English followed by questions from PI but expect no participation from post-docs and students. Fourth, work-life balance doesn't exist here, it's not in thier dictionary. If you finish your work on time, and leave the office on time, they will think that you aren't working enough. Our lab timing is from 9am to 6pm, and initially when i used to leave by 6pm, labmates said hey why are you going early! They even have a terminology for this: \uba39\ud280, which translates to eat and run, like have dinner and run away from office. Back in the final semesters of my master's degree I used to work from 9am to 10pm or 11pm, sometimes i slept in the office on my chair, and took shower in the shower room located in our office building. Why did they build a shower room in office building? Because you know right? All that because my advisor wanted me to do every trivial experiment possible and if I don't follow his orders then I don't get my degree (debate culture doesn't exist here either). This is my experience of Korea, so I will get out of here and never come here again. I never met a foreigner so far who really praised the work ethics of his PI and said that language barrier didn't affect him in his research life.

The people at the university are friendly, but as others have said they are not going out of their way to help you, especially if you can't communicate. I am not in a lab, but friends have told me they can't even get help to order materials or work the machines, so everything takes forever.\n\nAdditionally, as others have said, working hours are very different. 12 hour days are common for Chinese students and academic workers, although they do take a 1-2 hour lunch break.

Third, Koreans love to compare people and gossip A LOT so if that affects you and how you work, that will be a big problem; Fourth, looooooooooong days of work, almost no holidays so your stamina be better ready for this.\n\nDuring my first months, I  literally had to become the lab technician. I cleaned around, assisted my seniors in whatever they're doing, and I'm not allowed to sit for a long time or else i'll get called out and be tagged as lazy. My labmates don't listen to reasons so if anything gets wrong and I get the blame even if it wasn't my fault, there really isn't a way around of it. No matter how right you are, you are always wrong to them. \n\nI'm on my first year in the program turning second soon and I am not doing well. I don't get help from anyone in my lab and my Professor can only explain to me some concepts in minimal details, so I really have to study a lot about everything on my own. Already got scolded several times by my seniors and Professor for not knowing things. I don't understand what I'm doing and I am all alone. It is very difficult.\n\nUpside is, I can rant to my Professor. He listens but I doubt if he really understands the situation and if he's willing to do anything about it. My guess is, a big nope.

I didn\u2019t make a close connection with all of them (of course) but there were one or two that I bonded strongly with, and all of them were supportive when things were rough. Perhaps other people are in the same situation as you, and are also somewhat apprehensive about sharing their feelings with someone they are not close to? Maybe a casual, weekly meetup to alleviate some of the stress of the PhD life may lead to stronger friendships down the line? The fact that you all would be in the same boat would allow some group commiseration about supervisors, courses etc. which I found to be a bonding experience.\n\nAs for the crush, I would strongly recommend some therapy. I was stuck in an emotionally abusive relationship with a narcissist when I started my PhD (in fact, I chose the location of my PhD in hopes that the distance would automatically solve the problem) and if it wasn\u2019t for my therapist I don\u2019t think I would be writing to you today. Hours of having someone to talk to who was legally bound to silence (I have trust issues so this was a big thing for me) and who genuinely cared about my wellbeing helped me see how f*cked up the guy I was with treated me. These people are trained to help you work through emotional distress of various kinds, and when you find someone that \u2018fits\u2019 you, you will feel relieved about being able to at least talk about why you are so attracted to this person, and why you can\u2019t let them go.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hwqt1e/working_through_a_phd_while_lonely_and_having_a/fz5ywjg/"}, "2931": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "astro-temp", "Date": 1595650108, "Score": 5, "Body": "Yeah, I\u2019d find this kind of abstract annoying.

Ideally you want your chapter to be as clean and concise as possible, so don't be afraid to let your footnotes and appendices to do a lot of the heavy lifting. \n\nAs for losing sight of the argument/direction of your chapter, a good exercise I use is rad through the chapter and then write a short summary as though you were submitting it to a conference or journal. It only need be a few hundred words, and try to make it as clear as you can. I find this process is 1) fucking hard and 2) really helps you to refocus and drill down to what the fuck this chapter is about. Perhaps you find you have 5-6 different arguments all jostling to space in your chapter, and things are getting confused and convoluted... then that's a good sign you need to strip things back, split your chapter maybe, and focus on just on or two things per chapter.\n\nThink about the examiners who will read your thesis - if you try cram too much in to each chapter and make them wade through too much then they will become irritated. Be ruthless, and remember that there will inevitably be research and ideas that can go on the back burner for post doc work, for other papers etc. You don't have to fit *everything* in just because it's there.\n\nGood luck!

I am officially a part-time student, who has self-funded (with tuition assistance from my employers) while working full-time.  I have a kiddo at home who was 1 when I started and is now 5 y/o.  For coursework, I typically took a full-time courseload and finished coursework in line with the others in my cohort who were going full-time and had assistantships.  My program is at the university in my city.  I considered one a 2 hour drive away and am SO glad I didn't go that route.  It might be easier to find flexible programs now with COVID-world, but I'd stick close to home if you can.  Depending on what you're interested in specifically, you may consider interdisciplinary programs, like implementation science or a multidisciplinary specialty in development or something like that.\n\nCoursework, for me, was the easy part.  Someone else told me what needed done and when it was due.  I had an external schedule I could post on the fridge that told my husband when I'd be in class, etc.  It wasn't fun, necessarily, but it was completely do-able for me.  Now that I'm in the fully self-directed phase, I've struggled hugely.  Some of it is lingering burnout from the how hard I worked to get coursework done, some of it is my own completely unrecognized executive function deficits, some of it is a mismatch between my job responsibilities and school, and some of it is the lack of infrastructure my program has for part-time students.\n\nLessons I've learned that I wish I had known from the start:\n\n1.) Ask about how programs work with and support part-time students outside of finances.  I wasn't assigned a graduate advisor, so I didn't have that individual person assigned to check up on me from time to time or make sure I was linked up with research projects, etc.  This didn't matter too much during coursework, when I had regular contact with faculty, but once I finished up coursework, there was no one who was checking in.  I think I went almost a year without meaningful contact from my program (yes...I could contact them, too, but I decided to be a brat and wait them out to see how long it would take them to remember I was enrolled.  My cohort had 6 people, so it's not like there were tons of us.).\n\n2.) If you're working while going to school, make sure your employment is not just schedule-compatible, but is also \"brain\" compatible.  I spent the first 3.5 years of my program in a job that was supportive of my school schedule, but had nothing really to do with what I was researching and was sometimes at odds with it.  This meant that I spent tons of mental energy on work, and tons on school, but there wasn't any overlap.  I also found that, because of my work schedule, the times of day I had to devote to deep thinking and writing were by no means my most productive for those.  I don't think anyone does their best academic work between 10:00 pm and 1:00 am after working all day and caring for kids. I've since switched jobs into one that is much more aligned and the difference is night and day.\n\nBest wishes with whatever decision you make.  I am so glad I've gone back for my PhD and my work experience has helped inform my research tremendously, making my work much stronger and more relevant.\n\nEdit (typical workload): During coursework, I was typically \"in class\" 9-10 hours per week.  I'd say I spent probably 5-6 additional hours reading/completing assignments most weeks, with an increase toward the end of the semester when lots of stuff was due. Now that I'm past that phase, I could be putting any amount of time toward my work.  I'm not in a traditional lab, so I'm not tied to lab hours, and I don't have a graduate position, so my work is my work.  The more time I put into it, the sooner I finish, but it's all on my time at this point.  I probably spend 10 hours a week on PhD related work right now.  That'll increase when I write my comprehensive exams in October, and then probably again as I move into dissertation phase.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hy081x/phd_unicorn_in_healthcare_related_field/fzbsae7/"}, "3085": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "mdauthentic", "Date": 1595789507, "Score": 1, "Body": "A PhD student here writing my thesis atm (in a very close domain as yours).\n\nAs someone with industrial experience, it might occur to you often to think about a PhD topic as having much to do with development/artefacts i.e. having the impulse to write codes here and there but don't be tempted, you have to be able to reason first about the problem you're trying to solve, your contribution and then development comes last.\n\nRemember, the problem and contribution doesn't have to be too big or well-defined but it must be specific and novel enough to earn a PhD.\n\nLastly, I'll say read some papers in that domain and download some sample PhD proposals to get an idea of how to structure your proposal.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hx5776/need_help_writing_phd_research_proposal_in/fzbsca7/"}, "3086": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ohbonobo", "Date": 1595790108, "Score": 1, "Body": " [https://www.facultydiversity.org/](https://www.facultydiversity.org/)   If your university doesn't provide access, you may find something here that is interesting to you.

Good grades are obviously really important, as is having good references from your tutors. As you\u2019ve noted, research experience is also a major benefit. I think that forming good relationships with your lecturers/tutors is the best way to go about this. Look through your department, find some research that\u2019s going on that really interests you, and find out who\u2019s running it. Then send them an email, explaining your interest in the project, and ask if you could come and talk to them in more detail about it. I\u2019ve always found this works better than emailing directly asking for experience. When you talk to them, ask questions about what they\u2019re doing - be engaging. Ask them if there\u2019s any chance of getting some experience working with them. A lot of professors won\u2019t say no to some free labour by an interested and intelligent student!

More concretely, that could mean doing an \"Independent Study\" with that professor for 3 credits or whatever. I'm a PhD student in CS, but my background is in Linguistics. As a junior I worked a year doing random tasks in one of the ling professor's lab and I think it opened up at least \\*a\\* door for me, but that quickly had a domino effect of getting more and more research experience before starting the PhD. I think not enough people wanting to do PhD's really understand that RESEARCH is completely different from anything you've done before in your academic career. Working in a research lab this way wont actually fix that, but it will give you some experience working in a lab, that down the line other people will appreciate. You wont end up doing anything super interesting -- most likely helping run experiments, or doing some more tedious labor, but I think its a good experience in the end.   \n\n\nSo start by messaging the professors that you took your intro to sociology classes with, or whichever sociology professors you took classes with that you really liked. They'll be happy to help you. And remember -- if a professor doesn't respond, just write them again. Professors are especially busy now, and just because they may forget to reply, doesn't mean they dont want to help you :-). \n\nHonestly I wouldn't bother with reading academic papers yet in sociology -- you are not far enough along in your courses.

There is so much advice to give.  I\u2019d worry less on getting into the program and more into what you\u2019re going to do once you\u2019re there.  \n\nFor example, do you have a specific research question?  Are you trying to work in academia?  Know what you want.\n\nAlso, take a year off.  In that year, research potential topics, find a program that specializes in what you want to research, read syllabi for doctoral program classes.\n\nUndergrad to PhD is like going from high school to the NBA.  It\u2019s doable, but you have to be exceptional at what you do if you want to succeed.  There\u2019s no hiding in a PhD classroom.  In my program, classes were 3 hours long with 8 students.  The reading was non-stop and that\u2019s on top of stressful TA duties.\n\nAlso, know the faculty.  You\u2019ll have a committee with a major professor.  Some chairs are supportive, some help you do research, and some are horrible at being a chair.  \n\nThe workload and stress of a PhD program are no joke. \n\n2.  Research experience is important, but not a priority at every school.  An R1 is a top research school.  At these schools, research is key.  Having research experience is great and helps, but I got into an R1 without research experience.\n\nOther schools may not have that research focus and that can help and hurt you on the job market if you stay in academia.  That said, some smaller schools want to be R1 schools and push people to do more research with less resources.  \n\nThis is why knowing where you\u2019re applying is key.\n\n3.  Dissertations are: introduction to the problem, literature review, research method, data analysis, discussion.\n\nSome programs are different and some are doing 3 published papers where you simply have to have 3 published peer-reviewed papers.

I would never allow a job to put me in a high stress environment, so why would I put myself through that.\n\nAlso, in my program there are a mix of people that work 24/7 and those that only work during the week. My one office mate, who did her masters/undergrad at MIT only works 5 days out the week, and she has already won a best paper award at a top conference in her second year. So for those who say, 24/7 work is just 'how it is these days', I think that's completely wrong and it is a false narrative that academia tries to force down your throat so you can stay productive.\n\nMore context: I just recently began respecting my own health, time, and boundaries.

I agree perseverance is important,  but you must agree there is a survivorship bias in advising from mentors. I once heard a faculty member say to a group of grad students why are you all worried you have always been in the top ten percent.  Guess what, by simple probability: if the top 5 to 10% of undergrad students populate the PHD programs, then 75% get postdocs. Take those people, then if the top 30% get positions that allow them to apply for research grants and 20 to 30% are funded after multiple application, then ultimately you are not talking about the top 10%. You are talking about 0.225% to 0.675% of those original undergrads. So, if you are talking about starting with research focused postdocs,  it's not really true that all those postdocs are in  the top 10%. More reasonably you have to be in the top 5 to 7 percent of PHDs to get funding and guarantee tenure.\n\nBy the way,  every year there will be more competition for those positions since the rate of exit/retirement from tenured positions has declined with increasing life spans and the number and quality of new graduates consistently increases as well. It is better not to think of this. But your rosy conclusion is both shortsighted and ultimately cruel. One of my coauthors recently faced losing tenure as a junior investigator when his mentor changed institutions. He had 3 years (maybe a couple more) and failed each time. There were definitely numerous factors,  but he drank himself to death. His mother found his body in his apartment after a welfare check. I know several people who have similar stories.  They are not as rare as they should be. Blindly saying that everyone that can get a degree will succeed ignores reality.  This is basically still a taboo subject.  Taboos only perpetuate and cloister abuse by those who maintain the status quo.

I would talk to the students one on one and see what they say about the advisor's, like do they make you work ungodly hours, do they communicate well and so on. Also actually enjoying what you do helps so much. Find things outside of school that help destress and make you happy, if it's reading, running, games whatever and try to take a small amount of time each week to do it. Also therapy is great.

This was the case for me, and I think it helped my perspective massively. There's a huge disconnect between those who have only ever experienced academics and those who have 'real world' experience. Those who have been privileged and lived off 'mommy and daddy' and those who have had to fight and figure it out. Of course, these are extremes on a spectrum and people lie somewhere on that spectrum, but I've found academia skews to the privileged, family $$ side. So for people who are consistently used to being top of their class, for whom undergrad came easy, the change of pace and independent learning required in grad school is something new and not necessarily something they're good at.\n\nAcademia definitely has its problems, and it is good that we continue to call them out, but my PhD was also 4 years where I had consistent income and benefits (my income was about $24000/y pre-tax, which was enough to be able to pay rent and food, a few social events and a gym membership), the freedom to explore my own creativity and interests, and I made some friends for life (both within my program and in the wider town). I was fortunate that my PI never demanded that we work nights and weekends unless there was a huge deadline coming up, and never denied me time off when I requested it (for surgery/traveling out of the country to visit family over the holidays). There are periods of stress, but the work stress was nothing I hadn't experienced in previous jobs. It was made worse by PIs with limited 'real world' experience and underdeveloped social/emotional intelligence. For me, the most stress came from life events that happened during my PhD (e.g. CW here:&gt;! my own cancer diagnosis, sexual assault, being drugged by my housemate, a close friend who was in an incredibly abusive relationship, family deaths!&lt;) and still trying to be productive at work. \n\nSo the TL;DR version is: PhDs have periods of stress, are dependent on how reasonable/emotionally intelligent your PI is, and your support network will help massively.

I also take 3 weeks off every winter to fly back to my family on the other coast as a vacation, and I don't bring my work with me. The only time I deviated from my 9-5 schedule is a month where I worked evenings because a paper review came back while I was at an internship and I needed to come back to the lab on top of that internship to make sure that my revisions got turned in on time. \n\nI think that depending on the person, there may not actually be that much of trade-off between success and maintaining a healthy amount of time in the lab. I have five first-author publications under my wing, and I'm trying to come out with a sixth one before I graduate. This is pretty high output for my field, and my committee said they would consider three papers to already be sufficient for a thesis-by-publication (I'm set to graduate at the minimum recommended time in my program, which is pretty rare - most people take two years longer). I've had oral presentations at three conferences, and poster presentations at another (different) three conferences, and I'm an invited speaker at another international conference next week. I've also held a six-figure fellowship from the federal science funding agency. So in all, I think I've had pretty good output in general.\n\nI chose to stick to a 9-5 schedule because I noticed it worked really well for me in an undergraduate co-op research position I held. Prior to that position, I had a really erratic schedule due to courses, where I'd work evenings and sleep late. I noticed a huge difference in my ability to focus when I had more rigid work hours, and when I was getting enough sleep every night, so I really wanted to keep that up during my graduate program as well. But as an additional huge benefit, even if you physically stop working at 5 PM, it's not like your brain shuts off - I've had a lot of occasions where I'm walking home from the lab, reflecting on my progress for the day, and then suddenly realizing the clever solution to the problem that I beat my head against the wall on with little progress for the day, or additional cool experiments and hypotheses that I could do to make what I worked on for the day even more interesting. So I think having a really clear split between \"this is the time you do things\", and \"this is the time where you process and reflect on things\" means that I've been able to proceed a lot more efficiently overall, because I'm ready to implement the smartest strategy to my problems that I could think of at 9 AM the next day. \n\nA couple of notes/conditions that I think are important to keep in mind if you do choose to go with this direction:\n\n* Be really strategic about what kinds of projects you take on. Limiting your time in the lab probably won't work well if you take on projects that legitimately require a lot of hours invested, like those that require a lot of watching over experiments, manual assembling of datasets, etc. My PhD revolved around finding more labor-efficient and unsupervised ways to do certain kinds of bioinformatics analyses, which are typically done through a lot of labor. So this was great, because not having to do stuff like, manually labeling images, was built into the description of my project! (I think in some fields, especially experimental wet lab biology, finding projects like this not be possible or at least be very hard, however.)\n* Find a supervisor with a similar strategic mentality. I got really lucky on this one. My supervisor has always believed in the idea of making bioinformatics analyses practical, and recognizes that a lot of labs won't adopt methods if it means they have to spend hundreds of hours getting them to work. This trickles down into how he trains his graduate students: whenever there's an analysis that we \"need\" for a paper but would require a lot of time to do, he always asks us if there's a faster or less labor-intensive way to show the exact same point. \n* Apply for grants. A big component of being able to maintain this schedule was that I did not have to TA for most of my graduate school career, since my fellowship gave me enough income. I got teaching experience elsewhere on my own terms, to keep me competitive for future jobs - I volunteered to teach computational workshops for graduate students in the biology departments. A lot of graduate students view the grant application process as a pain in the ass, but consider the time spent writing grants as an up-front investment - it eventually pays off by freeing up so much time in the future. \n* Develop a good sense of what items are important to invest more or less time in. The big obvious point here is coursework - I didn't spend a lot of time on deliverables for courses, outside of making sure that the code was functional or the theory was complete. I have a few A-s in some courses, but it doesn't really matter in the long run - no one is going to look at your transcript as opposed to your research when you have the PhD. You should work hard to develop a sense of the \"hidden curriculum\" - what deliverables matter and will impact your reputation in the field or your status on the job market later, and focus your attention accordingly. More generally, I think it's really important to overcome perfectionist impulses where they won't help you. For example, I've noticed that compared to other graduate students, I spend a lot less time trying to make sure I get all of the parameters of my experiment perfect before I run things - if it's just the first runs, I often just need to do an imperfect run to see if there's any signal in the data at all, for example, and if there is, then I can always go back and optimize things to make the signal pop more. \n* Investing in good communication skills will pay off massively. I spent a lot of my free time volunteering in board positions in non-profits, where I worked in policy-writing and on grant applications, and for a while, working as a freelance journalist, because those were things I was passionate about. I quickly realized that these skills were massively applicable to my PhD. I had a comparatively faster and easier time writing papers and grant applications compared to my peers, and my reviewers really appreciated the clarity in my writing. I was able to spin relatively boring experiments and even negative results into compelling papers through my framing and argumentation - I only had one paper rejected my entire PhD career, and that paper was accepted by another journal with minimal revisions. \n\nExpanding on the last point more, I want to push back against the unspoken assumption that \"free time\" is automatically \"wasted time\". I invested a lot of my free time into writing, and that gave me clear, transferable skills to my PhD. But I don't think it has to be writing skills specifically - the projects that you pursue in your free time will probably give you different perspectives, experiences, and talents, that help diversify you over other academics. I think this really strongly relates to some of the observations that have been shared about successful scholars in the past few years, and specifically, the idea of \"academic superpowers\" - that scholars might only be average at most skills, but have very strong talents in one or two specific areas, whether it be building collaborations or thinking creatively about experiments or grant writing or whatever, and they're able to exploit the subset of skills they're good at to become exceptional, with most scholars pursuing different paths to being exceptional depending on what they're specifically good at. But I don't think these skills emerge out of no-where, and often, what helps hone them is what you're interested in and choose to prioritize outside of your formal academic career! This was definitely true of my writing skills, and it paid off massively by giving me an edge in grant and paper writing. And I definitely think it could be true of many other things - sometimes even if you're just doing things for fun, it results in you really developing a persona that distinguishes you in academia.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hzuv39/not_working_the_weekends_and_not_selling_my_life/fzt5gbw/"}, "3556": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "piglet33", "Date": 1596155415, "Score": 14, "Body": "I'm a biomechanist.
