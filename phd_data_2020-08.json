You're off to a good start and you've proven to yourself you're capable of writing up. \n\nFor myself, I did a lot of 'writing up' as I went along with the research. I didn't think of the research phase and writing up phase as being entirely separate from each other. I don't know if this is possible in your field, but there is nothing to stop you drafting chunks of chapters, or just writing mini essays/papers/chapters on whatever thing your working on now so you have hard, written up material to work with when you tackle the chapter down the line.\n\nLastly - your thesis doesn't have to be perfect, it doesn't have to be  some ground breaking magum opus, it just needs to b a good piece of work that holds up under peer review. I took a lot of comfort knowing that I was a PhD *student*, doing my *first* research project, and at the very beginning of my academic journey. This is how your examiners will view your thesis. Nobody expects you to be submitting work on the same standard as the surrounding secondary literature, whose authors have spent decades working in their field post PhD. I'm not saying it doesn't have to be good, or at the highest standard you can manage - but don't let unrealistic notions of perfect get in the way of getting it done. \n\nAnd I guess as a post script, if a dumb dumb like me who do it, anybody can, haha :D", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i2219o/3rd_year_slump_1yr_to_go_uk_full_time/g02pdmu/"}, "122": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "imightjustcry", "Date": 1596361272, "Score": 4, "Body": "I spent the entire afternoon making this lol, pls hmu if something doesnt make sense.\n\n**PSA**: I'm a biologist, a structural biologist, and will be using examples from my field to explain how writing LitReview in excel sheet works for me. You'd have to figure what the components are for your field to work this out. Sorry about some jargon that is there in the sheet, I would def help if you have anything you dont understand.\n\nHOW THIS WORKS:\n\nThe main idea is to \\*break down\\* all info from the papers that you read into readily accessible information. Generally, writing it down in the form of a paragraph makes it harder to retrieve the information and hence use it while working. Writing in in Excel sheets has shown to be MUCH effective in that respect. I've explained more in the sheets!!\n\nHere is how I do it:\n\n1. For a week I go on Literature sprint where I parse through \\~4 papers/day.\n2. I fill in the sheet as I read a paper, so no double work of reading and highlighting and coming back to it to make notes.\n3. Update info by writing references across contradicting info -&gt; most often it helps you target experiments that can answer this contradicting info\n4. I break down all the information that can be taken from papers into sheets (example: component information, structural information, mutational information)\n5. The more papers you read the more it helps in understanding what these sheets need to be.\n\n**Advantages**:\n\n1. ALL your information is available. organized and in soft copy hence can be accessed anywhere.\n2. Helps you think critically because you HAVE to make sure that its information you can use in your research. I found that while reading a paper I find SO much information interesting but they weren't exactly relevant for my research, I did note those info somewhere just not in this sheet.\n3. Having your litreview in one place helps others if they want to take over or join in your project.\n\n**Disadvantage:**\n\n1. Can get cluttered if you dont know how to write down info and break it down to a sentence.\n2. Hard to bring in a new system to a bunch of people, works better if its only you making it.

I then tag the article, save it in whatever folder I need for organizing, and then I \"update\" the mendeley app by \"pulling down\" in the folder menu.

You are trying to always answer questions like how can we more accurately model social decisions rather than why the social decisions take place, or even what the social decisions are. The theoretical aspect of the PhD will mostly deal with improving the methods that we use in statistical research, rather than the outcome of the research itself. If that's your thing, I think it's a great idea to do a phD in stats. \n\nIf you care about social decisions specifically and want to understand the decision-making itself, i think a more conceptual field may be better.

It also depends a lot on your supervisor and whether they also share the vision for the project that you do. \n\nTLDR: it doesn't matter what the label on the PhD is, but rather the topic itself.

I found a professor whose work I've read and admire and sent them a short email (like three paragraphs) where I introduced myself, gave some examples of their work that I've read and my thoughts about it, explained that I'd love to do my PhD studies under their supervision, and asked if it would be possible to meet to discuss their research and look around the lab.

We eventually met and spoke for about an hour and I was encouraged to apply for an upcoming position.\n\nHowever, I don't know if it had a huge effect on my chances of being accepted. PhDs in Sweden are jobs, not studies, and as such personal connections between the supervisor and the student are not really factored into the hiring decision, it's more about credentials and relevant experience. In fact, the final decision on who to hire wasn't even taken by the supervisor, they just rank all applicants based on their credentials (I was the third choice on that list, which is why I don't think my email and meeting had a huge impact on my chances). The final hiring decision was taken by the dean, based on the supervisors ranking of the applicants.\n\nThat said, meeting the supervisor and talking about their research with them allowed me to gauge whether or not I would find the research interesting and if I would fit in with the department. I was also able to get a better idea of what exactly they were looking for, which helped a lot when writing my project plan. It's also given me a bit of a head start in developing a relationship with my supervisor. There also were no interviews at all during the hiring process, so if I hadn't emailed the professor I wouldn't have had any chance to meet with them.

The PhD takes a break when I walk away from my laptop (granted it seems like those with worse experiences don\u2019t take this mental break when away from the laptop), but I still need to figure out everything to keep the kid alive and happy 24/7 and the chores seem to increase exponentially. Sitting at my laptop with my PhD work feels so easy and less draining in comparison to making sure she doesn\u2019t kill herself in ways I previously couldn\u2019t have even imagined all day long. However, none of that matters because my daughter is the best thing in my life and I would give up the PhD in a heartbeat for her.

Obviously you want to aim for a \u2018good\u2019 university/department, but because researchers are so disparate/heterogeneous in their research interests \u2014 especially in a newer subfield like entrepreneurship \u2014 it really helps to drill down to look at who the specific people are you would ideally want to work with, and then work backwards and see where they are based. \n\nTo give a few ideas of schools with good entrepreneurship scholars: UVA/Darden, Notre Dame (US), Babson (they host a big entrepreneurship conference), Queensland University of Technology (also host a major Australian-based conference), University of Melbourne, Copenhagen Business School, Bocconi, yes, INSEAD and all the usual super-brand suspects like Cambridge and LBS.

I kept three notebooks: one for observation, one for interviews (record (if possible) and write the interviews, trust me) and your thoughts after coming back from the field. Try to be consistent. Back up your data, make copies, constantly.\n5. There will days and weeks where you don't feel upto it- be kind to yourself then. \n6. Fieldwork will be a whirlwind of emotions- it will be hard. But this is the most solitary thing you will do so customise it to make it good for you. \n7. Discuss your thoughts and feelings with friends. It helps to get a different perspective and you go back to the same field with new ideas. \n8. My supervisor required me to send a detailed fieldwork report and plan every two weeks. That really helped. Keep your supervisor informed (even if they seem to not give fucks). \n\nHope this helps.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i3fbig/preparing_for_ethnographic_fieldwork/g0bcff2/"}, "461": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "la_barque", "Date": 1596538987, "Score": 6, "Body": "Neuroscience", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i3c3b2/whats_your_phd_in/g0bcfsp/"}, "462": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "la_barque", "Date": 1596539510, "Score": 2, "Body": "I think that the UK doctoral loan is around \u00a326k max, so be careful as I don't think this is enough to cover fees and living expenses for 3 to 4 years (but I might be wrong you should check this out).\nI know there are also possibilities of beeing a post-graduate teaching assistant (PGTA) depending on if your department offers such opportunities.

PhDs often also teach, but the focus is on academic research. \n\n2 - Doing a PhD is very different from doing an MBA or other kinds of degree. We don't learn that much by taking courses, we learn mostly by working as a researcher. Either doing our own research under the guidance of the faculty, or assisting the research of the faculty. So, doing a PhD is very close to getting a job, and a very hard job, a very time-consuming job. You should think of it as a full-time job. There were periods when I worked up to 15 hours a day (not common, but still something that can happen). \n\n3 - It depends on your goals. If you have an advisor who is considered one of the best of the best in the world in a topic, that can surely open doors to universities with higher reputation too. It also depends on how strong you are as an applicant, because competition to enter Finance PhD programs of universities with strong reputation is fierce. We see a lot of amazing applicants, with near perfect GMAT/GRE scores, good research experience, strong letters of recommendation from professors with a good reputation in the scientific world, etc. \n\n4 - As I mentioned before, a PhD is like a job.

Never ever just look at how many papers a PI has published as a way of determining whether she/he is or will be a good fit. It doesn\u2019t matter if a PI published amazing things as a grad student or postdoc. Their previous success will not necessarily translate to their grad students and they probably had a decent avisor to start with. \n\nIf having access to previous grad students is complicated or if current students don\u2019t say much, you can always still look at the publications of a PI but do not simply focus on the number of papers or the names of the journals. Some nice, and easy to spot, metrics are for example the papers where previous/current grad students or postdocs appear as first authors. This will tell you, at the least, how active the group is. There is more into it but as a first approximation it is a useful piece of information. If you spot a sensible lack of grad students in the publication list that should be your first red flag. Now, in how many of these publications does the PI\u2019s name goes at the end of the author list? Are there usually other PIs involved. Does the PI always publish the most important/sexy papers with other senior level researchers? This second metric says something about the ability of a PI to be an independent researcher that can actually provide her/his students with decent projects without the involvement of other PIs. \n\nSorry if the advice seems overly specific.

They can be helpful for figuring out the community sometimes, but also think about why they would be so willing to seek out an outsider and share their perspective with no basis of trust.

There are MANY dynamics at play that you are not going to be aware of. There's a balance. You entering that space can change that balance. Tread carefully, especially if you want to be trusted and welcomed back into those spaces. \n* While you're doing the ethnography, the people you are interviewing are the experts on themselves and what you're seeking to learn more about. How are you incorporating them and what they want in your research plan? If you're investigating X, but they're really interested in learning about how Y affects their community are you also making sure to address those concerns?

You're taking data from them in these interviews, so if you can also make slight changes to your research design to also address things they're interested in learning about I think that's a good thing to do.\n* Remember that you need to establish relationships, not just extract data.

I plan out my weeks on a vertical Monday-Friday A4 page using my Outlook. I will add meetings to my Outlook calendar as soon as they are made as we use Outlook for email so it\u2019s easy. I set reminders in Outlook so I\u2019m physically alerted to things appropriately. E.g. 15 mins before, the day before, 2 days before depending on the item and also a second reminder prior to if needed.\n\nIn my Filofax I will block out my time so I can visibly see what I am booked in for and when. When we were on campus I used a whiteboard blocked off for my weekly schedule and updated it at the end of each week ready for the following week. Some things were fixed so I just left them there and moved others.\nI have also been using a yearly wall planner to see the overview so I can easily see how many weeks away something is (it has a daily place marker so you can easily see today).\n\nI use Scrivener to do my writing as it\u2019s easier to use than a long Word document.\nI have an iPad Pro and pencil and use GoodNotes app to read and annotate papers I\u2019m reading.\nOnce I\u2019ve made notes on my papers I can print them out and put them in a ring binder in a specific section for each topic area my PhD covers. I use Dropbox and also have Zotero to collect my research papers in.\n\nWe have an online portal where we keep track of all the training/monthly progress reports/milestones but we also have a VLE where we can do some of the training online in the VLE. \n\nI currently don\u2019t have any more compulsory training to do as I did it in a couple of months of starting (I got it over and done with) so now it\u2019s just CPD type stuff or webinars that I think will help me with my research area. \n\nAlthough everything has been online recently it still gets hectic! Like last week, I had 2 conferences and one workshop to attend across the week, the workshop was just Monday 11:00-15:00, one conference was at 16:00 for an hour each day with 2 sessions on Friday and the other conference started at 10:00 Monday and was an hour each day but started an hour later Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by 2 workshop sessions on the Thursday and networking on the Friday. If it wasn\u2019t for my Filofax and Outlook calendar I would have missed stuff all over the shop! \n\nThe visuals help me get my head around the look of each day and the reminders help me keep focused on the right thing at the right time.\n\nHaving a ring binder means I can also easily file notes in one place and have them separated by a divider. \n\nI then have colour coded hardbound note books for planning some of my work, I lecture and need to sort out the curriculum for my students. Not a lot of PhD\u2019s have as much responsibility as me but I am a fully trained teacher. You might have other things you need to plan for - maybe you get involved with helping undergraduates in your area or you have a PhD group you help with. Keep things like that in a specific notebook, if you randomly don\u2019t have it with you, make a note of something on a piece of regular paper or sticky note and transfer it to the right place later. This also works for using GoodNotes or OneNote (or any other digital notebook) as well a physical notebooks.\n\nSet aside time for your reading and writing and stick to those times as much as you can. Only change the time if you absolutely have to attend a training session at that time for example. But make sure you re allocate the time for your reading/writing.\n\nTry and attend the online networking type sessions and when we can get back to having them in person attend those as much as possible. I feel really awkward networking and having to talk to people (I have Aspergers, ADHD, and dyslexia) but with every event I\u2019ve found it easier. \nMy supervisors find this funny as I stand up and teach in front of large groups of students and I\u2019m fine but ask me to network (or present my own work for that matter) and I\u2019m not so great. Going to special PhD events and talking to anyone and everyone there, it was the first time most people had met, really helped me feel at ease. I asked them questions as much as possible which helped me feel less nervous and helped me find areas of interest to talk about with them.\n\nAsk questions! Your supervisory team are there for a reason, or ask your fellow PhD students. \nAlso, obviously ask here! But sometimes you may need to know about your uni specific regulations or procedures. \nSome times just having a chat with my fellow PhD students has helped me feel less stressed or given me ideas. \n\nJust don\u2019t stress about it all, keep your milestones in view, chip away at the work towards them and make sure you take time out for yourself. Drink water regularly throughout the day, eat sensible food - I find meal prep helps with that. Try and have a social life and get regular exercise. Get some decent headphones, stick on a playlist that will not distract you wanting to sung along (I use a Trance mix on Spotify, it has a decent pace and I can\u2019t really sing along! Or a different language or classical). \nSometimes even just sitting there or wandering around thinking maybe with headphones on to block out too much background noise helps. Definitely take a walk and get some fresh air every couple of hours! \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve just started using MomentumDash, it replaces your home page in your computer browser with a nice photo as the background, quotes, the time, and stuff for free. If you upgrade to the pro version you get additional things to use such as a pomodoro timer. I have now linked the Todo list area to my MS ToDo as that also links to my Outlook on my computer and the ToDo app on my iPhone.\n\nEnjoy the journey!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i48g7x/organization_tips_for_starting_a_phd/g0i3dz4/"}, "691": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "ashtonibalogna", "Date": 1596670976, "Score": 1, "Body": "this guy posted a while back and i adopted a lot of his methods https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gu0hw4/my_system_for_reading_and_writing_during_my_phd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i48g7x/organization_tips_for_starting_a_phd/g0i3xv1/"}, "692": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "OrganisingMyLife", "Date": 1596671864, "Score": 3, "Body": "Academic positions - not always available and you definitely do have a boss! \n\nI\u2019m currently doing my PhD full time and I\u2019m also lecturing (basically full time - but I am a rarity). \n\nWhere I am, as a regular academic staff member you have to do a certain amount of teaching hours in an academic year as well as your research. If you don\u2019t fulfil your research quota each year you never hear the end of it. You need to put out high quality research to attract funding and make the uni look great. \n\nIf you are teaching, you need to keep students happy to keep the numbers up whilst keeping the complaints down, but whilst ensuring they are still performing to a suitable level. \n\nAcademia isn\u2019t an easy job, and even once you\u2019ve gained your PhD it is not a certainty that you will stay in academia as there might not be a role available, you might not be a good fit at the uni you completed you PhD at, it might take you a while to secure a role after your PhD. A lot of PhD students go into other areas on completion.\n\nA PhD is hard work and a journey. Don\u2019t take it for granted you\u2019ll automatically be an academic on graduation, the actual numbers of PhD students staying in academia is a lot lower than you\u2019d think. If you don\u2019t like the idea of having to teach students, grade papers, and do your research at the same time then it might not be a good end goal. \nHowever, there are plenty of other roles out there that would benefit you having a PhD if they are your thing of course. Basically, if you want to do a PhD because you want to do several years of research and you have the funds to do it then go for it.

Here's my experience + advice\n\n1 - Don't do a PhD in econ. Terrible job market, universally terrible faculties, and IF you manage to get a tenured position after graduating, expect no more than a ~$100-120k salary at the best of schools. Finance PhDs are better still, easier job market (although its getting tough these days) and any most top 100 schools in the US, you can expect a starting salary of ~180-220k. culture amongst faculty tends to be much more supportive, since student intakes are 2-4 max (as opposed to Econ's 10-30 students which they plan on failing half).\n\n2 - Your first 2 years of PhD will be coursework, very heavily involving mathematics, statistics, econometrics, micro/macro economics + seminar classes. If you haven't otherwise taken linear algebra, real analysis, multivariate calc, and intermediate statistics - i highly recommend you do so. During my first semester, I was probably studying around 40 hrs a week, excluding class time, although most of it was for a notoriously difficult class. 2nd semester was a bit better, but that was because I was burned out and just didn't care if I got a B or A.\n\n&gt;Secondly, as a person who loves comfort and quality, academic position in universities seems to be very attractive. You don't have a boss, you can choose the topics you want, \n\nFrom what i've seen an heard, this isn't the case. The head of the dept is technically your 'boss', and you have a ticking clock above your head. If you want to make tenure you have to come out of your PhD strong, with some very promising projects in the pipeline. \n\n&gt;you can choose the time you work, and so on \n\nExcept for professors approaching emeritus, one thing I've noticed is that everyone is always working. Especially assistant professors, but even associate and full professors probably work upwards of 60hrs a week on research (in the US). \n\nYou also don't necessarily have a weekend, unless you plan your time well. It's not like a 9-5, where mon-fri and the rest is 'me' time. It feels as though everyone you meet is an overachiever, and works super hard, so if you want to outperform, you have to put in the hours.\n\n**Pros**\n\nWhen you find an interesting topic, it is extremely fun to work on. ive spent the last 2 months working on a project with a really cool dataset that I discovered, and my supervisor got really excited about it. some days you can just read endless literature, understand what you want to contribute and then actually work on executing it. You may not be changing anyone's life, but if you have something you are interested in learning about, you will really enjoy working on such a project. You may even publish a few papers in your sub-field, and then you'll be recognized in the inner circle as an expert on the matter. \n\nI also doubt you are changing anyone's life in a 9-5.

Congrats on writing up your manuscript! You're about to enter an interesting, exciting and perhaps a little soul crushing experience. Regardless of the outcome, keep your chin up.\n\nHaving said that, when it comes to identifying good venues for your manuscripts, you must consider several factors, the most important ones being the quality of the manuscript, the methodology and scope, and the time you're willing to spend in the back and forth of reviewing. Regarding the first factor, be objective: is your manuscript very well written and very well developed? Has it been proofread several times? Have you asked a few peers to give you feedback? Is it as solid as it can be? You'd be surprised as to how many poor manuscripts get to my desk every month (I'm editor and reviews editor for two influencial journals in my field). We call these \"desk rejections\" and they take me about 5 minutes to identify. My advice: don't be one. Of course what for me is a desk rejection, for a low ranking or predatpry journal it can be an opportinity. Don't fall into those traps.once you have evaluated the quality of the manuscript, if it's perfect, you may start thinking about better journals. \nRegarding methodology and scope: is your paper parhbteaking in any way? Is it extremely original? Is its mwthodology rock solid, or even inovative? In what ways? These questions will help you identify journals that focus on certain topics or subareas. Even journals that focus on specific methodological aspects, helping you narrow down the possibilities.\nFinally, are you in a hurry? This is always a bad thing, but if ypu happen to be (say, you need the publication to graduate, or for tenure) you might want to look for journals with a reputation for quick response. The fewer papers tbe journal receives, the quicker. But also, the lower ranking. This is an oversimplification but it'll help you.\n\nIn sum, find a journal that will welcome your already wonderfully well written manuscripy because it'll value it's methodology and scope (as evidenced in similar publications the journal has got out recently).\n\nTip: cite publications from the journal you're submitting to :) \n\nBest of luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i4q9yy/advice_regarding_publication/g0k9yvm/"}, "748": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "One-Light", "Date": 1596723638, "Score": 4, "Body": "I have done this a few times and it's always a tricky thing to navigate.

Nobody here is in the wrong, and as you settle into your PhD you and your supervisors will hopefully figure out how your professional relationship works. \n\nThis is also a good time to work on a skill that will be super valuable for you down the line. As academics we often feel like we work almost exclusively in the written word, but you will have to be able to articulate your work outside of the written word as well. No getting around it, you gotta. You will most likely be presenting your research at conferences, where you will be expected to explain your work and field questions. Also remember you will eventually have to defend your thesis in a spoken exam. In the UK we call our PhD defense a 'viva', from viva voce or quite literally the living voice.

I am six years into a PhD in the US in cancer biology and have been in a highly toxic situation with my PI and institution for over 3 years. I feel that the PhD system in the US is horrible and many statistics say that up to half of PhD students quit, and many more are depressed. \n\nAs for my particular case, I believe that once a student passes candidacy, the PI and university should do everything in its power to graduate the student since they've deemed them intellectually worthy. Unfortunately my experience was complicated and I am just a casualty within the economic/political power trip that is my lab. Weirdly, we have too much funding and I have never seen so clearly every way in which money is a vice. To sum up and simplify what happened - my advisor essentially blamed me for the lack of success in my project field despite the fact that the lab (10+ employees) has only produced one low impact non-methods/review scientific publication in the 7 or so years it has existed. I called it in February and have been navigating the murky process of quitting so late in the process. \n\nAt this point I am waiting for some university red tape so that I can at least receive my Master's and am wrapping up my writing in order to do so. As far as how it affects my work, I'd say it affects my entire life really. I was, and am still recovering from being, chronically depressed induced by the situations related to my progress and mismanagement. It has been 6 months since I made the call and I feel pretty good about it now despite anger and sadness that I believe will take years to fully process. I have no motivation to write my thesis now that it is a huge body of work that will only amount to a Master's, but I am working on it now that I have exciting job prospects that will likely require me to start soon.\n\nI do feel this is a change for the better, and I am not attempting to give advice to anyone since every situation and every individual is unique. Personally, I have interests outside of academia and science and I do feel very hopeful about those possibilities. It feels amazing to realize that there are people out there who see your skills and talent and actually value your time and sanity. It will always be sad that I did not receive my PhD, especially as I see my peers graduating having done about the same or less work.

For instance:\n\n\\- Your prospective advisor isn't likely to pair you up with a disgruntled or unhappy current trainee when you're rotating -- that's not the face of the lab they want you to see.  But when you're in the lab (if you're doing in-person rotations this year), try to pay attention to the hours people keep and any folks who seem to be working a lot less or a lot more than the norm, folks who seem to spend most of their workday on their phones/laptops procrastinating, or folks who give off a generally unhappy vibe.  Try to strike up conversations with any of these people -- sometimes it's best to have these conversations outside of the physical lab space, so you can ask them to grab coffee or lunch (or virtual coffee) -- and get their perspective on things.   \n\n\\- If you can strike up rapport with a senior grad student who's nearing graduation (or someone who's recently graduated), they can be a great resource for giving you a recent historical perspective on the advisor and the research group.  Hopefully they'll be honest with you if you ask them things like:\n\n\\-- \"based on what you've seen, what separates trainees who succeed here vs. those who struggle?\" \n\n\\-- \"do grad students here generally pass their quals/prelims/dissertation defenses?  if some have failed, why do you think that is?\"\n\n\\-- \"since you've been here, have there been any/many trainees who have left without their degree or switched groups?  Why?\"\n\n\\- definitely glean attitudes about how the advisor gives criticism from any group meetings/research talks you're able to attend (in person/virtually).  If you aren't sure that you've seen enough by the time your rotation in that group is finished, you can always try to continue going to their group meetings while rotating in other groups if your schedule permits.  In my PhD group, these group meetings more often than not resembled a group of sharks attacking prey -- this should have been a red flag, but I ignored it.\n\nDespite due diligence, you probably won't be able to figure out everything before making your advisor/lab decision.  For example, I totally missed the fact that my advisor had a habit of kicking trainees out/forcing them out with a master's after 2, 3, or even 4 years if he decided they weren't up to par.  I only realized that was A Thing with him when he did that to multiple colleagues during my time, but later on I heard about many other people he had done this to in the past.  You see, my program only took students who were pursuing a PhD; coming in for a master's program wasn't an option, but you could leave with a master's if the PhD didn't work out.  Yet looking at the lab alumni page, it appears that about \\~25% of degrees awarded  to our group's alumni were master's.  Also, if you left my advisor's group without any degree (like if you switched labs), any trace of your time in the lab was erased, your name and picture were deleted from the lab website, even the alumni section, etc.  This happened to a few people during my time in the lab, and it wasn't until then that I put together all the pieces and realized many people before my time whose names I heard occasionally but couldn't find on the lab website had been in this situation, and had literally been \"erased.\"", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i8uiyh/some_advice_for_those_starting_phd_programs_and/g1c1c8f/"}, "1564": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "b_33", "Date": 1597332847, "Score": 14, "Body": "I've heard horror stories where the person who does the work doesn't even get first authorship.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i8yh7k/professors_be_like_before_and_after_a_paper_get/g1c4v3p/"}, "1565": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "blacklist-007", "Date": 1597333641, "Score": 7, "Body": "Lol thats gotta hurt.

Maybe it's ok if you're fairly young, as you said. But I see people with much more to show than just excellent grades. So, if you apply later, I think you should be able to show more than just grades.\n\nAnd straight A students can have a very hard time doing a PhD. They are typically very successful at learning the existing knowledge, solving problems with the things they are taught. That doesn't mean they will do good when they don't even know what the problem is (finding the problem can be a huge challenge). After knowing the problem, they don't know if the problem has a solution. After believing the problem has a solution, they don't know where the solution might be (it could even be in a field of knowledge you'd never imagine, very distant from yours). After finding where the solution might be, they don't know if they will be able to get to that solution (maybe they'd need more resources, more time, etc.). \n\nStraight A students can have a very hard time working on a problem for a full year, for example, just to find that they can't get any result out of it. And that not uncommon in academic research, no matter how good you are. As a professor here said, this is one of the few types of work where failure is the standard, not success. Experiments fail, analyses fail, papers fail, etc. Straight A students are typically not used to failure after failure. \n\nNow, why I'm saying all of this? Because this may be the pro or the con that defines whether a PhD is worth it or not. If the uncertainty, the challenge, the stress of failure is a huge con for you, then maybe a PhD is not worth it. On the other hand, if you think you will love exploring the unknown, you will enjoy the risk that is part of this job, and facing failure just motivates you to do better, then all of this should sound like a pro, not a con. And then a PhD becomes very worth to you, because you won't find this kind of thing easily in other jobs. \n\nI'm much older than you.

Your place of work also might sponsor you to get a Masters if an advanced degree is required for advancement.\n\nPersonally I think it is a good idea to get employed ASAP and work for a few years to build up experience and capital before going for a PhD. You'll have a better understanding of the job market and skills you should be looking to learn. You'll also be able to lean on your experience to stand up for yourself in academic situations.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i9js97/is_a_phd_worth_a_low_salary_for_four_years/g1g1obt/"}, "1687": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "rhubarbidooo", "Date": 1597416175, "Score": 1, "Body": "The best phd salary in the world is in Norway.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i9js97/is_a_phd_worth_a_low_salary_for_four_years/g1g2cr7/"}, "1688": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "hilospind", "Date": 1597416325, "Score": 3, "Body": "Finishing writing the dissertation, followed closely by public defense of your research.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i9gkgz/hardest_part_of_phd/g1g2o98/"}, "1689": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "hilospind", "Date": 1597416409, "Score": 1, "Body": "Great advice.

Here is some advice (feel free to take it or leave it because everyone's situation is different and I'm admittedly in a pretty privileged situation now compared to a lot of grad students).\n\n1) Your mental health is more important than a PhD (some people may disagree with this but it's something I feel very true, what's the point of putting yourself through the rigor of a PhD if you are miserable the entire time). You say  that you are on meds, that's a good thing if they are helping, if they aren't helping or giving you weird side effects, make sure to talk to your psychiatrist or whoever prescribed them to you some times it takes a while to find the correct dosage. If your school offers counseling I would suggest trying some talk therapy or a grad student support group, I was in therapy for quite a bit through out grad school and it really helped manage my depression and anxiety in addition to a low dose SSRI. They also tend to have good coping skills when it comes to stress.\n\n2) I am also strictly running numerical simulations and coding and was having a really hard time being productive recently. Here's some things that I (and some other people in my group) did. \n\n\\- There are apps that give you timers for when to work and when to take a break. A friend of mine did this and she went from about 4 hours of good solid work a day to a full eight or more hours. \n\n\\- After meetings with my advisor (for you this would be the post -doc) I make a list of everything that I want to accomplish by the next meeting. I split this list up into each day and each day I make a check list. Even if I don't get everything on the list done it really helps with the feeling of being overwhelmed with the amount of stuff to do.\n\n\\- I'm not sure what the bottle neck for your coding productivity is but if you are like me debugging a piece of code can take a really long time and can get really disheartening. One thing I've done is make a list (again) of different things it could be and debug using cute little toy problems to rule stuff out. Sorry if this is something you already know but it took me a while how to figure out how to debug effectively.\n\n\\- One thing I also do is celebrate the small victories, for example I finally debugged a piece of code and I reward myself with a piece of cake (or a 15 min walk, or some time with my dogs, whatever reward works for you). It really helps keep you motivated.\n\n\\- Try to make a schedule for yourself and schedule breaks (the app I mentioned above helps) and stick to it!!! Taking time off also helps in the long run. Depending on your work load it may be impossible to take 1 day off a week but try to schedule a half day where you don't work, check your emails, work on your CV or anything. Just do something that recharges you. Then the time you have off you aren't wasting by feeling guilty that you aren't working.\n\n  OK here are some ideas of how to deal with your funding and communicating with the post-doc. I don't know what kind of relationship you and the post doc have  so this is all depending on how supportive they are and how comfortable you feel with them.\n\n1) Ask the post doc about the funding situation, they may not know but they may know who you can ask, also ask around with some of the other PhD students. You may be able to get a TA position if your advisor doesn't have funding for you, this is super dependent on the university you are at, so asking around will probably be better information.\n\n2) Talk to the post doc about ways they stay productive. Usually successful people have tricks that may help. This of course depends on how comfortable you are with them and how formal/ informal your relationship is. A good mentor wants you to be successful and part of that is teaching you how to be successful. If you come across as solution oriented like \" Hey I've been feeling like I haven't been as productive on this project as I would like to be and I was wondering if you had any tips about staying productive\" (or something like that), they may be more open to giving some advice. It also shows that you are taking initiative and they may be more willing to help you.\n\n3) Have a serious (probably uncomfortable) conversation with the post doc about their expectations of you and where you are at in terms of these expectations. You may hear some stuff you won't feel good about (like you aren't meeting their expectations), but in the long run it will help. However if they are rigid, have unreasonable expectations, or are abusive (yelling at you or putting you down) this is probably not the way to go. I check in with my advisor usually once every couple months about my progress and what she expects from me and talk about long term goals but she's pretty open about that kind of stuff.\n\nI really hope things get better for you soon and I believe in you!\n\n\\-", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/i9p1dw/stressed_help/g1gss96/"}, "1726": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "erned9097", "Date": 1597428176, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thanks for your positive comment.

You can inform yourself about what jobs you could do after your PhD, network with people in that field/job type, and do any \"extras\" that might give you a proverbial leg up when you do start looking for jobs.\n\nBefore you spend money to try to get help with transitioning, I'd recommend that you check out what services your university/institution provide (mine has a careers advisor that works with postgrads specifically) and DO join your professional body, they tend to offer help for free (careers advise, checking CVs and cover letters, preparing for interviews, networking events, etc.) and they will know what people in your field end up doing once they leave academia. (This advice is good even before the PhD, really.)\n\nNow, this is off-topic but the association I joined is called the Cheeky Scientist Association, and I do want to say that I have mixed feelings about it. There was a post about it in this sub (I think) not too long ago by someone who felt bullied by the CSA (as a member) and I agree with a lot of what that person said. Basically, they have their way of doing things and if you don't agree that it is the best way (because you've tried it and it's not working) and would like some help with flexibility, you're probably out of luck. Another note: the CSA is USA based and very American-centric.\n\nThey do provide some helpful information and you can network with the other members, which is one of its biggest selling points. But the information you'll get is more limited that you might think before purchasing the membership, and I now do think that you can get the same type of help for free from your institution (if they have a careers advice service) and from your professional body.\n\nDo research them before you join if you are interested, be aware they they have very aggressive marketing (don't fall for it and don't let yourself be pressured) and there there are lots of programmes within the main one (the association itself), which is why what you get from the CSA itself without the extras is/feels limited.

The funny thing is that, after joining the CSA, I actually reached out more to my university's own careers advice services (and found out the continue to offer this support to alumni for a limited time, it's not just for current students) and also to my professional body. They offer similar advice as the CSA, but in a less \"bully-like\" manner.\n\nYou are absolutely right that you'll have to do the same work whether you are in the association or not. It is very USA-centric. And what pisses me off the most is that the aggressive / manipulative marketing (thank you, I feel exactly the same way about it) doesn't stop once you join the association because they have all these extra advanced programmes that they also want to sell you. I even got that same email you shared here.\n\nThat being said, it's not all bad, and I don't really regret having joined. I resent their marketing tactics and I would have much more respect for them (and trust, really) if they gave you more actual information about their programmes/products before you join, but there is some good that you can get out of it. I find that the CSA is especially useful if you don't have a good network from your PhD for whatever reason, which is the case for me.\n\nThe main benefit, in my experience, is that it helps you feel less lost and/or alone, like you know where to turn, and the CSA, its materials and the private FB group are always there. They have enough members that even if you feel that you are \"niche\" or a minority in any way, there will be others like you in there. This also helps counter-balance the USA focus of the association itself.If you know that you want a specific career type, (and if you can afford to) you can join that advanced programme. I have joined one of them, I think it's high quality and I do recommend it. (But that's off-topic here.)\n\nBottom line, my advice would be not to join the CSA until you've explored your \"free\" options first. Reach out to your university's careers services. If you haven't already, join your professional body and make use of their services as well. Use LinkedIn functions to search for people to connect and talk to to gain more information about your options. Look for recruitment agencies that work with people/companies in your field, talk to the recruiters. Also talk with friends, acquaintances, etc. even if they don't have a similar background because they might know someone who may help you (as was the case for the OP).\n\nIf you do join the CSA, don't expect too much from it, take everything with a grain of salt, filter the advice as necessary (especially if you are not in the USA), and do be prepared for the marketing BS to continue. Do reach out to people there you have something in common with and join their meetings because the other members are the best resource.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/hgd2mv/my_opinion_on_cheeky_scientist_personal_job/g1toec7/"}, "1996": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "someth1ng_au", "Date": 1597656352, "Score": 2, "Body": "Is 13 conferences a small amount?

Just we usually bury that choice fairly deep down so it feels like enjoyment happens to us, rather that we are in control of that.\n\nHow do I exercise that?\n\n* Embrace the suck for some things - There are some tasks that just fucking blow. I can't escape them, so I just try to embrace it and clear them.\n\n* Goal management. Taking on too much and having big aspirations is a PhD mental health killer. I'm not trying to change the world, I'm trying to write just 3 papers in 4ish years. \n\n* Saying no - tied to the above, the best goal and time management thing there is is saying no to stuff. Socially over stimulated? Overworked? Generally burnt out? You are not obliged to say yes to 95% of your PhD stuff, so say no to the stuff that isn't directly going to help you\n\n* have a progress trackable hobby - Mine is weight lifting, guitar and hiking. Things to do in my spare time that have the feeling of output/progress. Computer games are a great hobby, but I find that they're too easy to make me feel guilty about not being productive.\n\n* internalize that it is just a job. Separate the PhD from you as a person. Whatever happens for phd, you are smart, valuable, worthwhile and awesome in your own right. Completing or leaving a PhD has no more baring on you as a person than what you had for breakfast. This took off all the pressure for me, and allowed me to make so much space for life around PhD.\n\n* Identifying negative spirals. Sometimes I used to think \"oh I will fail, and then I will have to leave this country, and then I will have to move here, and then I won't know anyone, and then I'll blah blah blah\". If you find negative thoughts feeding negative thoughts, make sure you identify that you're no longer reacting to any real stimuli. This helps me stop and take stock and refocus on things that need my energy. Negative thoughts seldom, if ever, need energy.\n\n* and finally... Control complaining.

I am an addict who has been sober for 5 years. it has really helped me to cope with life (outside of addiction) and that drives me. It makes me feel like I need nothing external to be happy. \n- The relationship with my ex is decent. I feel I am doing 3x better with my breakup that i'd ever have imagined. \n- I have some nice time to play video games now, and socialize with people I didn't before because of work. \n- Being able to stay resilient and accepting has shined the light on some friendships that I didn't think were that close, but have been. I know 3 people who also had rough breakups and I feel like I was able to be a source of strength in their lives. That makes me feel useful. \n- It feels like the first time that I have a job that is not morally ambiguous at all. I feel like especially in these times, the pursuit of the truth about something is the most important thing I could be doing with my life right now. It is hard, unpredictable and often frustrating in the moment. But in the bigger picture, I am satisfying the basic human instinct: *the desire to understand* just for the sake of knowing.\n\nIf I had to give my happiness right now a rating out of 10, it would be 7/10. The older I get the more I realize that my happiness is 100% my making. I could be in a shit place and be totally happy. I could be in a palace and be miserable. The key has been how to be self-propelled in my well being, rather than how to arrange everyone/everything around me just so I can be happy. The latter is an unsustainable way to live because if I can't even fully control my self, how can I control anything else?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/icauns/are_you_happy/g22x11y/"}, "2312": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "staringspace", "Date": 1597824872, "Score": 2, "Body": "Final year PhD feeling the same.

It's particularly difficult to navigate in the academic environment where senior faculty tend to be very sensitive about how they are treated within their little bubble of tenured privilege. It is true that as a trainee you must go out of your way not to appear defensive. The key is to appear calm, friendly, and collaborative while still being able to keep yourself from being steamrolled (i.e., say things like \"i don't know, I'll have to see\" instead of \"no\"). So when I say not to take any shit, that doesn't mean let your feelings loose, it means that you should know what you need and are willing to accept. Make promises that actually benefit you, then make sure you keep them. If it's something stupid or abusive you are being pushed into, not directly saying \"yes\" means \"no, at least for now\". Give clear direct yes's to good faith requests, ambiguous answers for bs ones. NEVER respond emotionally, it makes you look weak. If you aren't able to get what you need from them and the deal is just not working out for you, go behind the scenes and seek help elsewhere, just be quiet about it to maintain decorum and keep everyone calm. \n\nThe thing I am trying to warn against is the attitude many students take where they believe they are worms and that they owe a toxic advisor their loyalty.

I had an amazing rotation in a lab, and the project seemed fascinating. But the thing about rotations is that they really are pulling a hard sell. In first year when you're focused so much on getting through yourself, it's hard to pay attention to some of the subtleties that can be red flags (or you notice them and tell yourself that you can overcome them). All in all, the work environment was severely toxic. The lab manager was the PI's husband, and he very much was a \"Slacker\". He wanted strict control over many of the things in the lab, but he was never responsible at carrying out these tasks. All the other folks in the lab just accepted it and carried forward despite actions from both PI and husband that simply dragged everyone down. I was encountering mental struggles myself which were somewhat evident, but due to lab size, nobody reached out to me (bystander effect).\n\nAt the end of first quarter being \"settled\" in the lab, I had been shocked by how little I got done among other issues in an out of the lab. I broke mentally, and I took a quarter medical leave for some pretty intensive treatment. Near the end of that quarter I made some realizations. I left the lab! And not just that, I essentially left the whole department to work in another building. It was definitely a challenge to get through the early stage bickering among faculty about my situation, but I managed resilience and assertiveness. All in all, it was administratively easy to switch (I just had to block out other people's comments). Nine months after making the switch, I am still so happy that I did!\n\nSo my point is: It is a lot easier to switch labs than people make it out to be. You have to realize you actually have power over them. This is your degree, and you're not gonna let anyone f\\*ck it up for you. There'll be some shock at first, but it will dissipate. You will know you're making the right decision when the other lab is welcoming towards you. That's the most important thing. Atmosphere is everything!

You don't have class assignments and exams (well, some programs do, but mine doesn't besides the occasional workshop, so talking from that experience as I can give the best reflection on that). You make papers, and they can be rejected, you improve, send in again, etc. You don't send them in and get a grade and that's it for the semester. It might seem like a minor thing, but it is a big difference. Another one is that you might work on one thing for very long, instead of on several courses for 1 semester and maybe a master's thesis for 1 semester full time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe also see if the university allows you to do a PhD using the 'three paper model'.

Suddenly finishing in 3 years with a dissertation, becomes finishing a paper in 12 months, and then you can start somewhat fresh with your new experience and decide on your next interesting research. Keep in mind you discuss this with your supervisor in advance though!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also don't plan to continue in academics after my PhD, decided that during my PhD and not so long ago actually, but I am still motivated to finish it! But keep in mind always how to design your PhD so it will help you later in your career, don't just take any PhD for the sake of doing a PhD either but get one with a topic and supervisor that fit you. You don't need the PhD, it would simply be nice to have, so make sure it stays a nice experience (even if it is very demanding, it can be very nice still, that's normal).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/igcspa/phd_in_social_scienceswhile_working/g2xicmj/"}, "3051": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "MichaelMMeskhi", "Date": 1598463036, "Score": 19, "Body": "I'm calling 911", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ih1x26/my_masterpiece_ruined/g2xij0h/"}, "3052": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Kevinist", "Date": 1598463713, "Score": 1, "Body": "I actually don't get too teach much, as I'm doing an industrial PhD with a company in a different country than my university.

Linguistics, while relatively new, is a huge field that encompasses everything from physical measurements of air waves to blood flow in the brain to derivations of syntactic constructions in different languages.\n\nAs such, each school has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the specialties of the faculty. The schools you mentioned are considered very selective. However, it does not mean that they are the best. If you are not interested in each school\u2019s specialty, they are simply not going to be beneficial to you. There\u2019s a reason why there is no ranking for Linguistics grad schools. \n\nLinguistics is much more than just language learning. It\u2019s difficult, but not impossible, for applications to be accepted when the person is not a linguistics major for their undergrad. For international students, it is much rarer. \n\nProfessors are looking for someone who can come in with drive, a specific interest, and a set of goals. If you cannot be specific and your application seems like you are not focused or have enough of a linguistic background to erase any vague descriptions of your interests, etc., then you will simply be rejected. PhD programs pay you to go there. They do not want someone who is fumbling around. \n\nAdditionally, with this pandemic, many universities are financially bound to either restrict incoming cohorts or simply not open applications for the next cycle. This coming year will probably be even more selective and competitive than normal because there will be more applicants paired with fewer positions. \n\nI suggest you focus on what you like about linguistics then look through different departments\u2019 faculty\u2019s publications to find professors who specialize in the same topics.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ihnymr/phd_in_linguistics_need_help_for_application/g35suqb/"}, "3280": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Pseudonymus_Bosch", "Date": 1598639549, "Score": 3, "Body": "yep :/", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ii601w/covid_has_made_being_a_phd_student_100_times_more/g35szeo/"}, "3281": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "vajra_", "Date": 1598644253, "Score": 7, "Body": "Can we flair for general PhD areas?

One is when I have something fairly difficult to do and the 'deadline' or time I need to finish it by is a long way in the future - I think this is common for a lot of people. I try to solve that type by giving myself deadlines - these are usually meetings with my supervisor or group meetings. I can often get through this procrastination by 'buckling down' and trying to force myself to get started. Once I'm started, I find it much easier to keep going, and then often very hard to stop (eg. working right  up to the deadline and changing things to make it better up to the last minute).\n\nThe other type of procrastination is when I've gotten too worried about my work. Often it's because I'm worried I don't have the ability/skills to do it, or that it will give me the wrong result, or that I won't do it in time. This type of procrastination is way worse and I think it comes a lot more from anxiety. When I'm this type of procrastination, I literally can't think about the work/problem I need to solve, it feels almost physically painful to do so. I also don't find anything I do while procrastinating vaguely fun and I'll often do things that don't even enjoy - anything to prevent me from thinking about the problem. \n\nSo to get work done I have to have a delicate balance between having a deadline and putting pressure on myself, and staying chilled out enough to get stuff done without going into anxiety mode.\n\nSorry this isn't really advice, just my personal experience.

A key part of doing primary research is reading the primary articles, as tedious as it might feel sometimes. It's SO important to actually dig into the article, particularly to critically evaluate the data/analyses/hypothesis/etc. Critically analyzing other's work will both make you a better researcher and writer, and allow you to contextualize the work appropriately.\n\nFor example, any paper can claim \"we cured cancer!\",  especially in some less reputable journals, but the maybe you actually look at the data and they only killed 1 obscure type of cancer cell in a dish and never even tried an animal study. This work may still be valuable, as all work has to start somewhere, but if you just throw it through a pipeline that pulls out a conclusion sentence, you might learn from it that cancer has been cured, instead of what the actual take home of the article is (*I'm assuming you're in STEM with this example, but the idea holds across disciplines).\n\nSo, how would your tech sort quality of journal, author, work, etc (especially since there can be massive errors even in highly-regarded journals)? How could it make the qualitative judgements that are so important in digesting and synthesizing disparate information?\n\nThere are lots of other strategies for improving reading that don't involve losing critical evaluation of the original work. If you're new to a particular field, focus on quality review articles first. Then, once you're more familiar with an area of work, you can target your reading by strategizing, such as: (1) getting better at targeting which articles need your time vs which you can skim or skip; (2) skip the intro and methods, focus on the results and discussion, ref back to the other sections if you find you need it; (3) arrange your schedule and incentives to help your reading be as effective as possible (ie do you absorb more info if you sit down and read for a full day, or do you function better with like X amount of time per day, at certain times of the day, etc?).

It helped me understand how to approach writing in logical stages instead of dreading it. Dare I say I enjoy writing sometimes now and I used to absolutely hate it.\n\nYour number 1 priority should be to develop a writing habit. So start tiny but focus on doing it every day at a specific time and place. If you want to keep going, then do so. But for week 1, if you finish your 15 mins then you've earned the rest of the day to relax. It sounds like a drop in an ocean but this is how habits develop. And it will grow faster than you can imagine. Within a month you will be writing 4-5 hours a day consistently.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ijbn8y/writing_depression_and_anxiety/g3fmj1x/"}, "3573": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "shermet", "Date": 1598847624, "Score": 2, "Body": "I know multiple people with physics phds who went on to data science jobs.

(That's assuming that by written research statement, you mean an \"Expos\u00e9\".) It might also vary based on your discipline. I can only say that in general, it's been my experience that if a research statement is required, that means that if the advertised position is within a third-party funded project that already comes with its own topic / area of research, they might want you to describe how your PhD project could be realized within that framework. If it's a scholarship or a place at a graduate school, they might expect you to apply for that with your own \"Dissertationsvorhaben\" (i.e. you should already have a working title, literature / awareness of the state of research, timetable etc lined up - you don't have to stick to it later and can change things as you go along, though some schools / supervisors might want you to hand in a revised timetable or work reports once a year or something like that). If the positions you're looking at are regular research associate (WissMA) jobs intended for doing a PhD alongside, then the heads of department there might still want you to show how your ideas for a PhD project could fit in with the focus of the department. Very much depends on how the position is advertised.\n\nI would advise you to speak to potential PhD supervisors and talk to them about your interests and try to figure something out but the specifics of what that would look like are all very contextual. Based on my experience (in a different field though), I wouldn't write a general statement. If a research statement is required, it's mostly to show that you have a solid starting point for your research, even if all the details can (and very probably will) change as you actually do your PhD. I imagine that this particular field of research is pretty competitive, so all the more reason to \"bring something to the table\" right off the bat (not in terms of knowledge because of course the point of the PhD is to acquire that knowledge; but in terms of having some idea of how to go about it). Sometimes there are also positions intended to be sort of pre-PhD and bridge that gap between getting your degree and developing an idea for a thesis, they're advertised as being about preparing your PhD but this again differs a lot (sometimes these positions are called \"predoc\" in Germany but in Austria a \"predoc\" is just a regular doctoral researcher, for example, so it's difficult to say what keywords to look out for).\n\nAside from reaching out to the potential supervisors, you could also try contacting the graduate schools or PhD offices at the respective institutions, they're often happy to help with questions about the application process.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/ijxq06/where_do_i_even_begin_phd_application/g3hc1f2/"}, "3658": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Lydeckerr", "Date": 1598890538, "Score": 2, "Body": "This is very interesting to me because I've never heard of someone having their proposal written for them by their supervisor (in Germany).
