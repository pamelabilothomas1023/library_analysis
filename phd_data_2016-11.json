First and foremost thing to do is think within the bounds of a manuscript. Whatever you do, you do it for either publishing it or patenting. You got to be clear on the story of your manuscript or at least the pith of it. You have to have an idea about the sub-sections and know the types of graphs that are gonna be inside.

I am glad that some students have excellent support system, but, from my experience I am clear that most of us are on our own. The sooner we realize this the better we can perform. \n\nThe most important thing in a PhD is getting a grip on perspective. Whats the burning question in your field? What actually has not been answered? Can you make a process better? Can you create a completely new process? If so, what are the criteria and what exactly are the challenges?

Just to clarify, in psychology you write the first three chapters (intro, lit review, and methods) first as your dissertation proposal. That's the 100 pages. Then you do the experiment, run the data, and write up the last two chapters which are results and discussion. I have sufficient power and controls, the change just wasn't as strong as expected. I can discuss why I think that happened, intervention wasn't long enough, maybe instruments weren't as sensitive to change, etc. It's science- I tested a hypothesis and it wasn't supported. It's not the end of the world or mean I shouldn't get a phd. I'm just disappointed. \n\nI have other publications that I have done throughout grad school. This is just my dissertation project. It's a 1 year-ish project that you propose and defend. It's in no way the only thing I have done in grad school. And psych programs are more on the end of 5-6 years not 7-8.

PhD in CompSci. \n\nIt depends on where you're up to in the process. \n\nIf you're at the beginning of your PhD (like first few months) there's no way to measure productive. It will take time. Turn up to work (yes work!) every day at 8:30, work until 5:30, tun off Facebook/Reddit/twitter while you're at work. If you've got nothing better to do, read a paper. Try to figure out what the core contribution of the paper is (not what they did, but what they learned) and try to figure out how you could improve on it. What I would look at is conferences/journals that have a high reputation but some kind of low-bar to entry method. For me in compsci, there are plenty of quality conferences that will take \"posters\" as a submission. Great way to get your foot in the door, do something substantial and valuable. Submit your improvement idea as a poster, short paper or work in progress. Go to the conference and talk with people.  \n\nIf I'm the middle years, writing a paper or three should be your goal.

The first time you measure something you'll always find you're measuring something different to what you thought. \n\nIf in the later years, you goal is to write chapters.

Even then, a university career is not quite guaranteed. I'm not sure if you've published yet, but it is a very difficult goal to publish this much during a PhD.

Regardless of anything else, this should be your number one priority when choosing whether you want to study it for 3-4 years.\n\nMy PhD has a few added benefits. Namely, working with industry, enhanced multi-disciplinary training, and a little extra than the minimum stipend (Around \u00a314,300 at the moment).\n\nI didn't base my choice on a career in academia. That's never been a goal, but neither was a PhD or even a Masters level qualification. But if the right opportunity turns up, why wouldn't you take it? Plans are to get an interesting job in industry (Software/hardware engineering, government institution, private sector in ocean technology, offshore renewables...), or a post-doc if that's a better option at the time.\n\nFor motivation: it's going to sound depressing, but it's the fact that there is zero guarantee in life for happiness, or fulfilment, or even meaning at all. I've been told countless times that my skills are well-suited to a job, that I could be earning lots of money in an industrial setting, or that a PhD just means I'm still a 'lazy student'. But no, I'm ignoring all of that, because my gut tells me there is a good future ahead of doing this project.\n\nIn your position, I'd think about the following few points.\n\n1) Do you enjoy independent project work? The reason you'll here this many times in the coming years is simply because it is an incredibly important thing to consider.\n\n2) Are you considering a PhD just because you don't know what you want to do in the future? Because a PhD is probably the hardest way to cope with putting off starting a career.\n\n3) Is the area you are thinking of going into likely to fund your position? I have 3 friends who self-funded their PhD positions. ALl three dropped out within the first 18 months, due to finances, or stress from finances.\n\n**TL;DR** My motivation is fuelled from thinking about the future. Consider why you want to study a PhD before you go for it.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_5e5oa2.json"}, "202": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "angieShroom", "Date": 1479923779, "Score": 2, "Body": "nah man I read it all.

I assume that if it published, it is likely to be true (at least with the current knowledge on the topic). It's not your job (at this point) to prove if somebody is wrong, but to get founding to be able to do that.\n\nHaving that in mind, I try to build a background for my research with the available sources. Think on it like writing a story. First you start showing a little bit of general context, and afterwards you tell everything around your topic, leaving a \"gap\" on the information, to develop the context for your research. That gap is where your research will fit, which is the conclusion of the story. In the development you should care about topics as why are you going to do what you are going to do, why it can be interesting, what technical drawbacks can you expect, why nobody ever cared about that before, if there are another known ideas different to yours to solve that problem and why yours could be better... And any other thing related to your research that could be of interest (of course, always trying to keep a positive mood about why your research is important).\n\nIn my field, chemistry, first I write a little bit about the history of the family of compounds I'm going to describe (first compound of the family, most characteristic reactions or products, technical applications of compounds of that family, etc). Afterwards I describe similar products to my own, but leaving some gaps my research will fill. If, for example, my research is about improving X property in my compounds in order to get something from them, I would start describing similar compounds that doesn't have the property (so afterwards I can focus my research on improving those products with the X property), I would continue by describing different products (unrelated to the family I want to do) that do have that X property and how it affect their behavior, and finally I describe products of my own family that already have that X property (if any). After all of that, fitting my research idea into that background is easy, telling how that X property would make those products interesting fo achieve something specific.\n\nEvery field is different, and perhaps in engineering, social sciences or other fields the best way is different. Perhaps knowing the specific field would help us to give a more accurate answer.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/by_id/t3_5fnmq4.json"}}
