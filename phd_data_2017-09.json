However, PhD holders are human as well, and there are always a few 'bad eggs'. For instance, a researcher that cares so much about prestige that they are willing to falsify data - this only serves to help their career (so long as they don't get caught) and is counterproductive for the disciple/field as a whole (and goes against the most important point of advancing knowledge).

Without the public, the actions of the PhD would be useless and the esteem, and prestige, attached to the title would be useless.\n\nLets say an institute like Harvard, who participates at the highest levels in the Justice system, and critiques the end result - disparity in justice/punishment between those with means and those without.

What if no-Nazis use those statistics to sell hate and the university uses that hate to sell themselves?\n\nIf the university system bills itself as \"anti-rape\"/pro-women, and profits from it, while an accredited university pays off a victim - and doesn't prosecute a minor league/college sports star, is that ethical?  Or only ethical when it is convenient?\n\nMy overall question, regarding the use of a title, is if the PhD title uses a group reward system - shared esteem/prestige - does that also include negatives and failures?  \n\nIs the overall ethics of the system that grants the PhD the responsibility of the PhD?  \n\nIf yes, can the PhD ask the public to subsidize the university system without taking the whole system into account when acting?  If the PhD is beholden to the public, is the whole public considered valuable?  Including the shitheads, failures, and destitute?\n\nIf no, is the title, and PhD/doctor individually, going to survive until the 22nd-23rd century while being attached to so many different systems (Government, student loans, college culture, minor league sports, MD association with insurance monopolies, and the like) without being bastardized, weakened, and prone to avoiding schools of thought, industries, or even publicly revealing evidence of failure in a system or industry that they are reliant on or attached to?

Something that I need to read very critically (for this I set 3 days per paper) \n\n2. Something that I need to read for information (I set 1 day per paper) - these are papers that someone suggests and tells me that the data are good and there are good things to learn from the paper (like a technique or an elegant experiment) \n\n3. Something I need to skim over to stay in touch (i set 3-4 papers per day) these are papers that are very close to what I am working on and because of practice and hands on experience with the techniques I can read them very quickly. \n\nI keep 3 separate notes for each of these things so when i have to refer back to those paper, i know immediately how indepth i read into the paper. \n\nFor reading, I set 1 hr a day as soon as I wake up before going to work and for critical readings ..I might have another reading session in the evening. I do not read anything on sundays, i have sunday mornings to kind of reminisce on what i read through the week or check through some of the things that are more interest in the paper. This process is kinda slow but it is plenty enough for my field.\n\nHow I make notes: \n\nusually the articles that I read are a set of experiments answering certain hypothesis. \n\nI divide papers (many articles are already divided into bite sized pieces- 1 piece per experiment)in 5-6 parts based on no. of sub hypotheses. \n\nthe notes goes..\n\n1. The hypothesis --- the experiment-----my interpretation of the experiment vs the paper's interpretation of experiment--extra comments or something odd that I found. \n\n2. Many people in the lab end up reading or going through the same papers so I'll add any useful sentences after talking to other people. \n\nI try to avoid writing very trivial things or things that are obvious. \n\nFinally how I make use of this information:\n\nFor my field of work, this information is useful while presenting in journal clubs or when my boss has to write reviews and asks one of us to help her with a section, writing proposals or eventually when I write the thesis. \nSince my notes is organized by the sub topics and by how indepth in read the papers..i can find the papers that I read very quickly. sometimes it takes some digging through but thats part of the process. While writing i try to emulate famous review articles or news and views articles to get ideas about how to organize and bring together the information at hand. it is kind of different for each topic in my case so its a learning process everytime i need to write. A very good thing to do is practice writing news and views style articles just for oneself but i barely ever do it because of time constraints. \n\nHope this helps.

I, as well a bunch of other graduate students, were offered a contract upon acceptance saying we get some *minimal* amount of funding support per quarter.  It is an actual legal contract with actual dollar values attached to it, and it is guaranteed for five years.  Basically a five year fellowship.  This funding included summer. \n\nThis summer the department decided that it wasn't going to pay some students, the reason being that \"there weren't enough TA positions\".  It turned out that there were TA contracts offered to students and illegally withdrawn post-offer and given to other students.  There were graduate students who were given priority over others even though the contract says you are only guaranteed funding for the first five years, and there were 6-8 year grad students getting full support for the summer. Some like me who were still within their contract got literally nothing.  It turns out the professor in charge (why a professor would be in charge still escapes me) of deciding who gets a TA position made sure certain students got TAships and for anybody else that was out of luck just said \" there's nothing I can do.\" I  went to the department and they said \"there's nothing we can do.\"  I even contacted my school's graduate student union and got no response which I take as \"there's nothing we can do.\"  I'm about to go to the Graduate Division office, show them my contract, and half expecting them to do some kind of bureaucratic calculus to end up telling me \"there's nothing we can do.\"  This wasn't a payroll error, it was a clear breach of contract, with legal ramifications.  \n\nThe thing is, we are poor graduate students, we can't afford legal advice, let alone to take our department and school to court, and if we did, they would probably terminate our contracts and boot us from the program.   What they did was probably illegal, but fighting it would likely put me in more financial ruin or not amount to anything.\n\nYou'll probably get an answer like the one I did: you effectively volunteered your time and there is nothing the department can do.  Go to your graduate student union ( if you belong to one), and see if they can do anything.  I guess having your time and funding abused is just part of being a graduate student.

It really depends on your specific field and which journal you're submitting to.

Additionally there are some that are just weird and use their own custom format (*International Organization* is Chicago-esque).\n\n&gt;as journals will tend to reformat according to their own publication specifications upon acceptance for publication?\n\nSort of. They'll usually tell you on their website what the citation format for submissions needs to be. *International Security* for example says that any format is acceptable for submission, but after being accepted you'll be respinsible for converting it to Chicago before publication. By contrast, *International Organization* instructs everyone submitting to their journal to use their format by default.\n\n*Foreign Affairs*, is a sort of outlier in that they don't usually require any specific format so long as it's common within the field since they rarely include footnotes in their actual publication for aesthetic reasons. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know Chicago like the back of my hand because the graduate school (not my specific department) where I did my masters required all theses to be submitted in Chicago format.
