Another time my PI brought his wife to one of our meetings, I guess to prove we weren\u00b4t involved romantically or something. Over the course of my PhD he has frequently compared me to her. So i totally understand feeling like you have nowhere to go: it\u00b4s both borne out by actual experiences in academia, where power structures favour professors, especially white, male professors, and especially if you come from a lower position of privledge (ie, first generation student and/or not: white, upper middle/upper class, male etc), the intimidation tactics employed to hush up students can be very effective at making people feel like they really have no options available to them. Keep in mind this kind of isolation is a hallmark of abuse, and makes it easier to gaslight students, or paint them as \u00b4difficult\u00b4or \u00b4dislusional\u00b4, and that they are powerless, when often there are some, albiet limited, options available.\n\nI\u00b4m going to give you some of the tips i wish i could have given myself when i was in my first year:\n\n\\- Do no isolate yourself. I know if feels like you have nobody to turn to or who is on your side, but there are people out there going through similar things. Try to expand your network outside of your unversity and find other PhD students (in any field, shared experiences of gad school are more important then thesis topic) who are supportive if your immediate group isn't (mine werent either, often the intense in-group competition can bring out the worst in otherwise ok people). Try to reach out via groups, meetings, conferences, student associations, both within your area/university and outside of it\n\n\\- Regarding your supervisor: this person is predatory. Someone in the comments said something about a wife and honestly that only makes it worse because, as in my case, the wife could pop at some point. Basically, you need to find out your options for either changing supervisor, OR getting additonal supervisors and quietly removing this one from your main PhD activities. This latter tactic was used very effectively by a friend who was unable to remove her main sup, since he was very important in the field and her funding was attached to him, but she managed to acquire a co-supervisor who was great and basically in practice became her main supervisor and minimised contact with the first one. Check how your defense will work, because in the latter case, if you can get a supportive co-supervisor on your committee this can help minimise your current supervisor's power over you. Figuring out what you need to graduate, making some supportive contacts (yes it is possible, it's a matter of practising and gaining confidence putting yourself out there, having faith in your research and your abilities) and minimising this person's power over you and your PhD is critical. To wrap up this last point, depending on your field, try to be visible: whether its twitter, writing for a blog, conferences, etc, DO NOT let your sup take control of your image for his own advantage - let others in the field know you are a good student and person. Later on down the line, if he wants to paint you as problematic, he will have to do so in contrast to this image. This won't fly with a lot of academics because at least some will have realistic perspectives on what academic is actually like. \n\n\\- I totally understand, and very likely you are correct, thinking the the university wont take this seriously. However, it is really worth while finding the people at the university who deal with this (no idea in the US system), and asking if you can discuss this with them in confidence. You do not even necessarily need to mention this issue with them at first, but rather explain you are really unhappy with your lab and supervision and want to move urgently. When I need to talk about my supervisor problems, I generally say that he's just so overburdened with responsabilities that he hasnt been able to provide the necessary support. However, this will always be sympathesized with to some extent, because profs often actually are overburdened (clearly not your one if he has time to behave like this), and this could effect the quality of supervision. You do not necessarily have to tell the whole truth, if you dont feel you cant trust the system, you can try to work around it to your advantage (emphasis on try). \n\n\\- Regarding reporting this: of course you absolutely should report it. But i totally understand feeling that this is a waste of time given my own experiences, and i wish i could tell you that it would be treated professionally but that's hard to say in academia, which is invested in protecting those at the top. \n\n\\- HOWEVER agree with the person who said document everything. EVERYTHING. I suggest you minimize conversations that can't be recorded. Ie, aim for email exchanges and record meetings in person on your phone on the excuse that you can't write notes fast enough and his thoughts on your project are so valuable to you. On the other hand these types of profs often have a long history of walking a fine line in order to not get caught, so it can be very difficult to document their behaviour, since so much of it is obvious suggestion (PhD students are not idiots, we understand what the intention is, but they generally make sure not to say anything that can be produced at a later date that clearly shows harassment; this makes gaslighting easier, especially if the department or university is willing to join in, and they often are in order to protect their brand). \n\n\\- Another good option for making the best of a not great PhD environment is to take as much time away from it as possible - do fieldwork abroad, do an exchange at another university and extend your time there as much as possible, etc. I spent a lot of time abroad and working in libraries and this made a bad situation bearable. \n\nSorry for the long reply and good luck, obviously at the end of the day whatever choices you make will be the right ones for you.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vm3y10/my_advisor_thinks_that_i_am_in_love_with_him/iefopni/"}, "63": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1656671727, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

For jobs that require a PhD it's difficult to beat the US job market in terms of both availability of jobs and salaries.

If you hoped to do a certain type of job by getting a PhD, the USA offers the best chances of you getting that job after graduation.

Norway might be awesome place to do a PhD but unless your field is related to one of the few important sectors if the Norwegian economy like Petroleum or naval engineering, good luck finding a good job. The USA might not be the best place for the experience during the 4 or 5 years of PhD but after graduation the US might have the best job market for most PhDs after graduating. \n\nOne could try to get best of both worlds by getting their PhDs elsewhere and finding a job In the US but this is a lot more difficult  than it sounds especially if you are not a US citizen.

Many of your friends will be earning a lot of money, moving up in their career mean while you will be on a low paid salary. At times this is tough. The key to overcoming this is to remember your why. I.e., what made you do this PhD and how are you using it after that's so worthwhile. If you haven't got a why then it's going to be a struggle.\n2) Not sure what you mean by Eureka moment. The PhD is full of ups and downs. There's no real hitting the peak or sudden realisation of everything. It's a gradual, steady slow progress. But it's so important to celebrate every time you have a win (no matter how small). Always have the opinion that if you're too comfortable then you're not being intellectually challenged. So do a PhD that takes you out of your comfort zone. You might feel dumb sometimes but it's all a learning process!\n3) Advice to myself in the past - I would have applied for a PhD earlier! I let self doubt stop me but in hindsight I was more than ready. Another would be to remember that a PhD is an incredible opportunity to upskill for a lengthy time.

Thus, they can speak from personal experience. **Secondly**, as he or she is your dissertation advisor, I'd imagine they have been an advisor or reader on multiple dissertation committee's. From this experience, they've seen the good and the bad. They've seen areas where student's are prone to running into problems or struggling, including the structure of a dissertation chapter or the particular set of analysis one uses. Again, you don't have to always agree with your dissertation advisor/supervisor, but their opinion should be respected and given ample reflection/consideration.\n2. **Taking responsibility for your own decisions**: As I mentioned before, it is your dissertation and you have the ability to structure, format, write, and acquire data in anyway you prefer. You can do this even against the wishes or suggestions of your own dissertation supervisor. However, the important point here is you are responsible for your own decisions and actions that you take within the dissertation process. Therefore, during the 3-chapter defense, if two of your other readers/committee members bring up issues related to the general structure of your dissertation or the set of analysis you chose, don't look over to your dissertation supervisor and expect them to speak on your behalf or bail you out of a tough situation. Sometimes, grown up decisions means also facing grown up repercussions.\n3. **You have to know the rules if you want to play the game**: Academia is a scary place, especially for prospective doctoral students who want to become professors within our respective fields. This is an environment that is full of discrimination, power-dynamics, politics, the strong preying upon and exploiting the weak, and dictatorship-like rule occurring within classrooms and departments. For this reason, you have to be very self-aware of how you are perceived or come off to other people in power, your supervisor being one of them. You disregarding his/her recommendations and squabbling over a different set of analysis may have already painted yourself in your supervisor's mind as a: individual who is difficult to work with, a know it all, egomaniac, stuck up, and someone to be avoided. When I say \"knowing the rules of the game,\" I'm making reference to all the dangers that exist within the environment of academia and the repercussions that potentially await you if you \"play the game\" and make a wrong move, one being disrespecting a supervisor. Professors are very prideful people, with some thinking very highly of themselves, bordering on being a egomaniac. If you challenge their power, hurt their pride by talking back to them, or question their suggestions on your dissertation, who is to say they don't hold a grudge and make certain your 3-chapter or final defense is nothing short of hell? It seems petty and a very un-adult thing to do, but I've personally seen it more than I would have ever thought possible. I've seen a friend come out of a 3-chapter defense **twice** in tears after failing and ultimately being kicked out of a program. I've seen dissertation advisors sit quietly as their advisee (student) are ripped apart by the other two committee members for not taking their advice. I've also seen supervisors just drop a student/advisee in the middle of their dissertation for \"irreconcilable differences\" between supervisor and advisee. Again, I'm not saying you have to agree with everything they say or suggest, but just be self-aware of how you speak to your supervisor, come off, and the potential repercussions of saying no.\n4. **A privilege, not a right**: There is a saying, \"don't bite the hand that feeds you.\" In my field/program, I was able to choose my dissertation supervisor and two readers for my committee. For other people and programs, it seems that you are just assigned a supervisor based on dissertation topic and a professor's field of expertise. One has to keep in mind that regardless of if you chose your dissertation supervisor or were just assigned one, it is still a privilege, not a right to be advised and given guidance by a supervisor. Their time, effort, and willingness to advise you should not be taken for granted or simply \"expected.\" It's a privilege that a supervisor/professor is taking time out of their busy schedule to help you and advise you through the dissertation process, with hopes of getting you graduated and onto the next part of your life. The last thing they want is have their time wasted (due to missed deadlines), be talked down to, or be disrespected by a advisee.\n5. **A good dissertation is a finished dissertation**. The title says it all. Your dissertation doesn't have to be your finest work or something you are 100% passionate about. That is where post-dissertation research or publications can come into play. At the end of the day, why cause more obstacles to be put in your way or cause unnecessary stress simply because you wanted to \"shine,\" whatever that means or implies. Keep in mind, we are no longer undergraduate or Master's students. We are expected to get nothing but A-grades and keep 4.0 GPAs at the doctoral level. Thus, getting good grades is nothing special, it is the norm, standard, and to be expected. If you want to shoot for one of only 10% in the country (USA) that receives a \"pass with distinction\" honor on your dissertation, good luck. That is certainly a high-bar to shoot for an if it's important to you, I say work to turn in a dissertation that is worthy of that quality. For me personally, I just want to submit a quality dissertation, defend my dissertation and pass, and move onto the next chapter of my life. There are more important things than simply receiving individual praise or marks, you have to see the bigger picture.

I'll assume you're speaking to funded length and not the actual length (which tends to be longer). \n\nThe same first point from u/mnc01 applies to many but not all programs, and is the primary consideration. In my dept, we have 5 and 4 year PhDs (in terms of funding; our average times are nearer 7, and even higher with covid). 5 year direct entry: typically two years of coursework and a qualifying exam year, followed by two years funded thesis writing. 4 year, entry from recognized masters: one year of coursework and a qualifying exam year, then two years of funded thesis writing. You select your committee after entry, and your thesis ideas may pre-exist, change, or be developed along the way. \n\nAnd of course, the standard considerations about further time sink are contingent on your area of study. Someone writing on Proust's symbolism isn't about to be upheaved along their degree in the ways that a new PhD student writing on eg rhetorical analyses of covid media would be, or someone who was doing work on archives that closed during the pandemic or where an archival piece was acquired by another institute etc. I research some contemporary issues and my fields have evolved substantially over the past years that I've been in the program, and has required adjustments to my research along the way, and this is without failed starts, and without ethics approval (since I've forgone the qualitative data I might otherwise wanted to collect, etc). \n\nMy degree duration was a shock to grad students in other countries, whose programs were structured such that (a) there were very few direct entry options; and (b) your application to the school required you'd already secured sponsorship of a faculty member and a thesis plan. So you'd enter and start writing right away. Thus, the program could be two or three years, versus our four to five. \n\nThe four to five largely reflects the additional frontmatter, coursework and exams, which isn't as present elsewhere.

Also, start networking on Linkedin or sign up for coursera courses to expand your skill set. Just find ways to spend as little time as possible with research and shift your focus on your future. That should help.

You cite other people's work, you teach other people, you go to conferences to exchange ideas with other people. Yes, a lot of the work can be isolated and isolating, but this doesn't mean that social networks aren't vital to how academia works. You have to know the people in your field.\n\nNo, \"networking\" is not important and totally counterproductive in the sense that if you approach every interaction you have with anyone in academia as a potential opportunity for you to \"network\", then a *lot* of people are going to be put off, because they can see right through you that you only want to talk to them to try to get something out of them. People on the whole don't want to be made to feel like they are just an opportunity for your own career advancement. Case in point: a PhD student I know once went to a big association conference in the US; a fellow attendee went up to them and they started chatting, but as soon as this attendee found out this person was a PhD student and *not* faculty, they just killed the conversation and went away, presumably to find someone with tenure or on tenure-track. Clearly, this attendee was so preoccupied with \"networking\" that they forgot how to have basic interactions like a normal human. \n\nBasically, think about how and where you can interact with the people in your field, and when those opportunities arise, just be yourself and try to enjoy meeting people. In hindsight, you may very well realise, \"oh hey I just 'networked'!\".

Then go through the faculty profiles to find which ones match your research interests and contact them to see if they're willing to meet with you. \n\nWith my program you apply and then they match you (you can state your top 3 supervisors).

Do you want to do research? Is it essential for your goals, or are you just trying to get a good salary? If you want to learn to do research (i.e. start over) and think it's essential, it may be possible to continue. If it's simply for job placement and salary, unless it is explicitly required it's probably not a good idea.\n\nNow for the main issue: making up numbers. This is unethical, and while you ask people not to mention this, your standing as a student and researcher (and later in a regular job) typically involves maintaining a certain code of ethics. This is a relevant point, so there's no way around it. However, the best course of action if you wish to continue is likely an honest one. Universities are sensitive to the pressures of graduate school, and if you have not yet published any of this research, if you come forward and say \"I made up all of this data; it's not published, and I want to admit my wrongdoing and start fresh\" there is a fairly solid chance that you will be disciplined but likely not removed. Believe it or not this happens all the time, and universities know it. They will probably respect and appreciate the fact that you cut this short of publishing something that could damage their reputation. Of course I can't be sure of this, and I believe a lot of how the repercussions shake out will rely on how you present it, carry yourself, and express contrition, but really there's no way around it other than the truth.\n\nI faced a lot of \"ethical\" situations with my university and department (legal, not academically), and always found that if I approached people honestly, didn't make excuses, and demonstrated change that they held me in the same regard as everyone else. your mileage may vary.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vrxulv/time_to_leave/ieydoqw/"}, "1035": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "PopCultureResearch", "Date": 1657035957, "Score": 1, "Body": "Still out there looking!

People either misconstrue this idea or this narrative gets pushed by narcissistic or manipulative people.\n2. \\^To piggy back off this first point, I counter the \"putting oneself first is being selfish\" narrative with the the point that \"the more you put yourself first, the more you're able to serve and help others.\" I think as humans, every action we partake in has to have some sort of benefit to us. If I constantly put others first before my own needs are fulfilled, at some point I as a human being am going to become resentful or spiteful. However, if I want to be a selfless person and help others, I have to first help myself. When my own needs are met, only then am I ready to help out others.\n3. **The need to be single-minded with your focus and time**: I'm sure many people within this sub-reddit will echo my sentiments, but you're about to embark on one of the most challenging endeavors of your life, both mentally/psychologically, physically, and spiritually. Your going to be challenged academically, be forced to multi-task and manage your limited time well, and most likely will suffer at some point (if not, for long stretches of time) with sleep-deprivation, imposter syndrome, loneliness, depression, homesickness, and perhaps even fear of missing out (FOMO) as your friends and family enjoy their happy lives of not doing doctoral work. They don't hand doctoral degrees out like candy and there is a reason only about 1% of the population have doctoral degrees. For this reason, you have to be hell-bent, unwavering, and sometimes, single-minded in your focus and time to your doctoral studies to give yourself a chance at seeing this doctoral program through to the end. The means minimizing or canceling out (altogether) any potential distractions that could negatively impact you in anyway. Based on how you described your family, they seem to be a prime example (minus your mother). If talking to them throughout your doctoral studies is going to put you in a negative mood/mindset, place unnecessary stress upon you, and draw you away from your studies, I would think strongly about limiting your contact with them.\n4. **Seek out positive support systems**: You're at a disadvantage sadly because in most people's cases, their family would be a vital support system for moral and emotional support during your Ph.D program. However, make an effort to build positive relationships with your cohort mates and other students and professors within your program. Get to know them, go out for food and hangout, and take time out of your busy schedule to spend time with them. Reason being, by investing in them, they will hopefully reciprocate those feelings and likewise, invest in you. This will be valuable down the line when times get tough, dissertation writing seems like a herculean task, and you question whether you can continue on in this doctoral journey. It will be these very cohort mates, friends, and professors who will pick you up, give you words of encouragement, and hopefully cheer you on to the finish line. You should do the same. Lastly, keep in contact with the friends you have back home and make an effort to communicate with them as well, even while living across the pond.\n5. **Considering your doctoral journey a chance at a new start in life**: Yes, your family life and life back home may be in shambles, but consider yourself lucky. Not everyone has a \"golden ticket of sorts to get out of that situation in the form of studying in another country. Yes, you may not have a lot financially, your family life may be crap, and there may be a lot of uncertainty you're feeling about the direction of your life at the current moment. However, I would view your doctoral program as an opportunity to start over, get a new lease on life, experience new things, and hopefully view obtaining your doctoral degree as a way to get your foot in the door to the career and life you've always wanted.

Chapter 2 took me 3.5 years to finish due to mental health and similarly to you, dealing with imposter syndrome. However, after I finished chapter 2, it was the snowball effect where my confidence, ability to stay focused, and productivity grew steadily. \n2. Sometimes, depending on your topic or research focus, there just isn't a lot of previous or relevant research out there.

Are you dealing with the issue of not finding a lot of previous research studies within the same field as your own dissertation research focus? That's how I interpreted your statement above. For me, I just had to find previous studies similar to mine, but outside my own field. My dissertation topic is related to first-year writing, disability studies, and 2-year institutions. However, I had to highlight findings from previous research that focused on results based within 4-year postsecondary institutions and outside the field of English/composition. Thus, you can set up the need for your study by highlighting how there have been similar studies in the past, but not a study that has a research focus on this particular population and environment. \n4. At some point, you can't continue to scour the internet for books, dissertations, master's thesis, and journal articles related to your topic.

I have been enjoying a roughly \\~28 to 30K yearly stipend (9 months). When I lived close to campus, didn't need any transportation, and didn't have a lot of friends to go out with, I was able to afford living in a 1-bedroom by my self,  resume my expensive hobby, and save like 1k a month. I used part of my savings to move away from that town and go to Manhattan, and still had some money left on the side.\n\nWhen I moved to Manhattan, I shared my apartment with three other people. I needed to take the subway and the train to go on campus, pursued my expensive hobby, started to date my partner and had more friends to go out with (which both mean that I went to restaurants, the movies, the museums... a lot more often). I was able to save maybe $50 (maybe a little more sometimes) dollars. I did not touch my savings or very rarely.\n\nThe pandemic happened a few months later, and I was one of those who moved to another state with their partner but kept their apartment in Manhattan since we didn't know how long the pandemic would last. I got even more intense with my expensive hobby. I need our car, so there is some gas and some maintenance to cover. The state where we are is pretty expensive + paying rent in the city + my expensive hobby = $0 savings and some credit card debt. Eventually I broke the lease in the city and it took me some time to recover financially. Waiting until mid-September to get my first check was rough.\n\nThis year I had no apartment in Manhattan, not much of my expensive hobby, I was paying Amtrak every month for commuting, we ate takeout a lot because we were struggling to cook at home, but I was still able to save more. This summer I am being super careful and probably will struggle again to cover bills + live a comfortable life (such as buying bird feeders and nice produce at the organic store, instead of living super cheaply), but my partner is covering most of our domestic expenses, and I'm cutting back on my expensive hobby. My goal this summer is not to get into any credit card debt. Next year I'm not teaching so I will only be spending my money on my expensive hobby, restaurants, and bills.\n\nIt all depends on where you live (are groceries expensive where you are? Will you *really* need a car?); what your spending habits are (will you splurge in your hobby like I did? Will you cook at home exclusively during the week, or do you also go out for beers and food with friends during the week?); what your philosophy is (Do you have hobbies? Would you rather drive everywhere, or are you ok with walking/biking?).\n\nYou can also get into additional work on campus to make more money if that's worth it (sometimes an extra job sounds worth it, but then if you have to take the train to go in an extra day than your normal schedule, then you're not actually making money). I did extra TA stuff, research work, and also worked as a projectionist for cinema classes. You can also work at the language lab, be a grader (that's a lot of work though), maybe do some proofreading/translation work when you hear of such offers.\n\nIn the summer, we are able to teach classes (online or in person) which are decently paid, but I always choose not to do that despite the money. Summers are important for research and writing. There are also other opportunities, like intensive studying abroad programs for undergrads which we can help teach, but those were taken away from me when the pandemic happened. I haven't re-applied to any because I couldn't afford it with regards to my writing.\n\nPS: I have university fees to pay for every semester, for which I use a student loan that I took in my original country because the interest rate was close to 0.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vc3nha/on_your_monthly_stipend_how_much_are_you_able_to/if3yqir/"}, "1249": {"Subreddit": "PhDStress", "Author": "GigglePuss2", "Date": 1657134151, "Score": 5, "Body": "Thanks!

However, there is nothing to stop you from taking the FSOT right now and going into the foreign service with your already considerable educational credentials.

I'm a bit older than most of the grad students in my office (33) so I wasn't necessarily married to the idea of a PhD anyways. I just really wanted to be able to contribute to the scientific world before I left academia, so I told myself that the only way I'd go all the way through my PhD was if I could find a project I was interested in. After months of searching, only one or two really sparked my interest, and I felt like one was COMPLETELY out of reach (MIT), and the other was in an area that I really didn't want to live, so I gave up on the PhD and started job hunting for a job at the Master's level. Less than a month later, a new professor at my current school contacted my previous school and specifically asked if we had any students interested in materials research with regards to a new additive manufacturing process. Every single professor that knew me forwarded me the email, and I immediately applied thinking I had a decent idea of what I was diving into. However, I almost immediately realized that wasn't the case once I started classes. I was also led to believe that my focus would be more on process optimization using the specified materials, but it was starting to feel as though I'd only ever get to test samples somebody else had made in their own optimization project. It was very disheartening at first because I wasn't getting to do what I thought I had signed up for, and instead felt like I had been shoehorned into a bunch of chemistry research (chemistry is my least favorite subject). It has gotten significantly better recently though, as I've now been trained and given access to the machine so I can create my own samples. All in all, getting into an unknown field has broadened my knowledge base to such a degree that I am extremely glad things worked out the way they did. I guess what I'm trying to say is, regardless of how much you currently understand, as long as you end up being interested in the research material, it'll be worth it in the end.

Acknowledge that there may be gaslighters, free-riders, and plaigiarisers - try to recognise them from early on and keep a healthy distance. \n\n3) Stop being a perfectionist, and plan and prioritise realistically - no matter how genius you are, you only have 24 hours a day. If you're not good at it, download a productivity app. \n\n4) Invest in a decent ergonomic set up (e.g. chair, monitor etc). You will be spending a lot of time sitting down reading, writing and typing for years to come. There is no need to jeopardise your back and spine for the rest of your life just to get that thesis done. \n\n5) Join a student committee to help arrange quarterly social events for PhD students. Every department has a small pot of money they can provide for students' socials, at least in the name of supporting mental health and morale. Everyone's inboxes are always clogged, so people will rarely check and show up at such events. At the end of the said event, you can take home all the remaining untouched food and drinks home for free. If there isn't a committee, take the lead in making one. You will get to know the department staffs in the process which might come in handy sometime in the future for finance related (e.g. travel reimbursements) or random things (e.g. tips on easy people to talk to if you have a favour to ask).\n\n6) Reach out to other PhD students supervised by the same professor for a coffee or (even better) beer. Make it casual but you want to learn from their experience, and be aware of things/ people to look out for. \n\n7) Last but not least, dare yourself with a public speaking course early on in your PhD. You will tremendously improve your communication skills which will be useful for conference presentations, random Q&amp;As, and the final viva. I've come across PhD students in fields that seem really complex or out of my rearch but I was still left in awe of how cool it sounded because of their great communication skills. Knowing how to pitch your ideas to the audience is a precious skill both in and beyond the PhD.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vtkh45/what_toolshackstechniques_you_wished_existed_or/ifa0cp5/"}, "1609": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "TemporaryRatio3988", "Date": 1657239817, "Score": 1, "Body": "Yeah, I agree with many here!

Every country, university, and department can be different when it comes to requesting or being assigned a supervisor/advisor for your dissertation. It seems like you have the opportunity to choose and request a professor to be your dissertation advisor, like I did. To be clear, they still have the ability to deny your request. Thus, it's your job to be a salesman or saleswoman and explain why you believe this professor is vital to your dissertation and research study during the meeting, explaining in detail what you think their expertise and inclusion within your committee provides you personally. This could be expertise within your dissertation topic, providing you the type of support you need during your dissertation writing (Ex. are reachable by meeting or E-mail as opposed to professors who are not and expect you to be more independent), and liking the type of feedback they've given you from past experiences (Ex. having taken previous courses with this person). This may require you to go on their university professor page and look at their recent publications, look at their research interests, and do a little bit of homework on your part. For some people, especially ones choosing a professor for their expertise in your topic, you sell them on your project by trying their previous work to your own (dissertation) and again, how their knowledge in the field would benefit your project.\n2. I want to say though, there are a lot of doctoral students that are under the illusion that a dissertation advisor always has to be an expert on your research topic. That is simply not the case. My current dissertation advisor is not an expert on my topic and was chosen by me for the type of support he offered, his feedback, and his welcoming personality. My two readers played the role of experts (disability and first-year writing). The advice I always give students at the stage where they are in the midst of deciding on a dissertation advisor is to ask themselves this question, \"do you trust this person to get you out of here in 5-years?\" When it came to my advisor, I asked that question to myself and the answer was \"yes.\" Doesn't matter if you like them as a person or professor and if you really respect their scholarly work. There are professors who I like and respect within my department, but their advising style just did not jell with mine (impossible to reach/contact, set-in-stone deadlines, expect you to finish your dissertation in the manner and speed they did). \n3. **Ask for a \"keep it real\" speech from the professor regarding a career in academia**: For me, I never realized the ugly side of academia until I started my doctoral studies. At this level, you work GA-jobs, co-publish with professors, take multiple courses with professors, are in department organizations where a professor advises the group, and you interact a lot with fellow professors. Whether a professor discloses grievances after a few drinks or you see it with your own eyes, as the years go by in a doctoral program, you begin to see the power dynamics, politics, egomaniacs, instances of inequality, the strong preying upon the weak, and examples of dictatorship-like rule being implemented within classrooms and departments. For some people, they learn this too late into their doctoral studies and even if they've been turned off my academia, they realize they have to complete their Ph.D as their too far invested (financially, academically, work put in). I would have this professor explain the good, as well as the bad in regards to a life within academia and only then, you decide whether pursuing your doctoral degree is worth it. I'll be defending my dissertation in October and while I have chosen to pursue a career in academia moving forward, a lot of these negative factors has definitely soured my view of the occupation a bit. In saying that, you would see many, if not all of these negative factors in any job you work, not just academia. \n4. Lastly, self-reflect and ask yourself, \"what do I need from an advisor?\" Again, this in regards to the type of support you need emotionally-is he a type of person you can talk to if you hit a rough patch or experience imposter syndrome? Can this person offer you support as a student-help you find sources, suggest certain framework or theorists to look into, provide sound and helpful feedback during chapter revisions, and be reached when needing to schedule a Zoom or in-person meeting? I would determine all the things you need from a dissertation advisor and pose these questions to this professor during the meeting. If they can't promise you most of these things you require, perhaps it's best to look at other options.

So, aside from the potential salary bump (which I assume will occur since you are in public education), finishing before 40 vs. after 40 is no different than finishing before or after 30, 35, 45, or 50, etc. Once you have the credential in hand you have it forever. You cannot yet fully see the full range of new opportunities this will provide in the second half of your career because those opportunities are not yet open to you. Think 5, 10, 15 years down the road.\n\nI finished at 42 (with career, house, established marriage and family) and found it to be a perfect age. I do not work in academia. Top leaders in my organization and in my field immediately recognize my personal maturity and calm self-confidence \\*and\\* I also have the benefit of being considered a \"fresh PhD\"and thus \"up to date\" on all the \"latest\" research and best practices. It's almost the best of both worlds. But when I was in your shoes, what really transformed my attitude was when I stopped focusing on how I'd failed to achieve my original timeline and started focusing on my perseverance.\n\nCompleting a \\*long\\* PhD is a tangible marker of your commitment to your field, your perseverance, tenacity, and personal strength. As senior scholar once told me, regaining the momentum after a break is infinitely more difficult than not taking a break at all. Wether they say so or not, people recognize this. Whether they express their admiration for your perseverance or seek to cut you down because they sacrificed their own personal or professional dreams at some point, they recognize this.  Above all else, remember that once you have the PhD \\*no\\* one, \\*no\\* circumstance, and \\*nothing\\* can take it away from you. It's yours that you earned forever. What else in life can we really say that about?", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vu11ce/lady_phds_will_you_give_a_fella_a_word_of/ifdtnra/"}, "1762": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Suspicious_Star4535", "Date": 1657308819, "Score": 2, "Body": "That makes sense. I'm actually also past the coursework stage and am now in this nebulous phase where I am working completely on my own and only really see my advisor once per month (common in the social sciences if you're unfamiliar). Honestly what I hate the most is seeing everyone around me being so much \"farther ahead\" than I am. My partner and his friends have awesome, well-paying jobs, my own friends are living their best lives, and I'm over here living on poverty wages lol. Personally, though, I can tolerate one more year. Surprisingly, I found my coursework more difficult than what I am experiencing now with my research. Its funny how everyone has their own unique experiences. \n\nI currently see my counselor via videochat. I think as long as you are still in the same state as your university you can access those services (as long as they offer videochat meetings). \n\nIf I were to have any advice related to your last comment, I'd say that you deserve a more positive narrative especially in terms of the feelings/thoughts you have about quitting. You've already come so far and now that you're ABD, you're actually in a really solid place. A lot of employers will happily either accept either an ABD applicant or a graduated one. So in terms of investing time and energy, to me it doesn't seem like you would be letting anyone down. If anything, life is so crazy and circumstances change. Ask yourself what would be gained for you and your family by quitting, as well as what would be gained by staying. If you can find more positives about quitting, then your family will thank you and you will thank yourself for being iterative and open to making a big change for the best possible outcome. And if you can find more positives about staying, pretty soon you'll be a Dr. and you can use and be proud of those credentials.\n\nThis actually reminds me of a blog called \"the professor is in\".

Instead, please make a habitual plan and follow it.\nI made a plan that I would work 3 hours in the morning, 3 hours in the afternoon and 2 hours at night. That was my goal, and I didn't care whether I met deadlines or finished anything. Whether it was a good day or a bad day, I forced myself to stick to the plan.

My therapist also helped me a lot in this process. When I looked back after six months, I was indeed able to be productive enormously and met all the deadlines. Moreover, please don't worry about academic deadlines.

And academia appearing to \"reward\" these behaviours might seem to be the case on the surface, but again - i do not think academia rewards the extent of anxious behaviour you are describing here.\n\nThere are layers to behaviour, personality and performance. Someone might make lists and struggle delegating because they are a classic Type A perfectionist. This is their typical manner of functioning. Of course a person with Type A personailty traits is vulnerable to aspects of mental ill health, and it's likely these behaviours heighten during stress. But if the behaviour is not disrupting their daily life, ability to function, or relationships, it's not pathological. Their list making is not the same as the list making of someone with an anxiety disorder.\n\nThey may appear same on the surface, but that doesn't make them equal.\n\nAre these behaviours common in academia? Yes. At certain levels, might they be rewarded? Sure. Are they perhaps ways that some people cope with stress? Likely. Are these behaviours possibly symptoms of underlying anxiety issues? Of course that's possible. But it might be *situarionally appropriate stress/anxiety* or a much larger issue. The behaviour can look similar on the surface.\n\nI say this because some people may read this and freak out that something is wrong with them, when in reality they are stressed and fatigued and in need of some down time/better work systems. \n\nI also say this because academia does not reward a lot of this behaviour when it's pathological. Imagine being a PI and needing constant reassurance at every moment of the day about your work and decisions. Literally the opposite of an independent, expert researcher. A good PI knows what they know, knows they know their shit, but consults other experts when needed.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's always good to pay attention to your behaviour and function. If you find you make a lot of lists but get literally nothing done/feel overwhelmed all the time, then it's a great idea to book an appointment with your doc and talk to them about it. They can refer you to a professional who can help you unpack your experiences, whether they are clinically diagnosable or not. \n\nBut overall, I think you've taken a clinical issue about disordered behaviour and layered it over non-pathological workplace methods.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vutby1/academia_strongly_rewards_behaviour_associated/iffvljt/"}, "1871": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "JesseH1994", "Date": 1657344305, "Score": 3, "Body": "It does not really matter which one of these programs you choose.

You can always make a paper better. You can always add another experiment. You can always expand that literature review. The person who obsesses over demanding a perfect paper isn't going to publish though. Excellent papers are often written quite sloppily because the scientists aren't focused on the technical skills of writing, they're busy doing the science. \n\n\n&gt;obsessively making lists\n\nThis one is pretty subjective to the person. If making lists helps you, cool. But no productivity habit is going to be universal for everyone, and I guarantee you a list does not magically make you more successful or productive. This grants you organization in a way that you might find helpful, but that's far from success.\n\n\n&gt;always working on something\n\nI think this is beyond academia. Capitalism demands more and more of your downtime be spent working on something. This is true in every job. I was scolded as a dishwasher at 17 when I was sitting down rather than restocking the kitchen storage items. I also remain unconvinced this leads to success. Just because you're quite busy, doesn't mean you're quite productive and successful. You can spend 6 months doing busy work for 10 hours a day and get very little done. This capitalist demand for work expectations doesn't translate perfectly to success. Just look at experiments with 4 day work weeks. People are just as if not more successful if they give themselves down time. \n\n\n&gt;lone wolf behavior\n\nThis one is entirely, 100%, false. Academia hates lone wolf behavior. Trying to be successful in academia without networking, collaborating, sharing your work, learning from others, and having a support system is extremely futile. The field is not particularly coy about that either. Workshops, conferences, lab groups, material sharing systems, and even academic Twitter are all set up to encourage and reward non- lone wolf behavior. Once you get a degree the best way to get a tenure track job and be successful? Networking and academic social service and collaboration.

This would of course mean unpredictable events can occur and delay the project, which is fairly common. But as you said, the supervisor never gets the blame as they are usually juggling many phd students.\n\n  \nHowever, in this regard, many supervisors do take advantage of vulnerable students who have no say in how their phd progresses, and end up doing alot of extra work just out of the supervisors own interests. I have seen students in our lab get side tracked for 6 months just to explore some new and flashy research that the supervisor saw on twitter one day and wanted to try it out himself. Of course the supervisor will quickly forget about this idea after a few months but the student wasted theri valuable time and ultimately caused delay in their own studies. this is a common occurance purely due to the fact that the supervisor has complete control over most aespect of the students. Supervisors are also quick to target students are very obedient and who knows will do extra work without much question since some people are just like that.\n\n  \nOn a darker note, many supervisors also purposely try to derail their students so that they simply stay longer and do more work since phd students get paid close to nothing to do world leading research. This would be the most plausible explanation for students who take a decade to finish. Let be honest, theres no way it will take 10 years to write a 50k word thesis, most of the contents would have been work done in 2-3 years. in this case, the students also dont have much of a choice, as they often feel they've already stayed XX years, whats XX more years, an excellent example of sunk cost fallacy.\n\nIn my personal experience, I finished my PhD in 3 years, but half of the time was wasted on useless tasks and projects which were completely irrelevant to my thesis. My supervisor had extremely poor planning which resulted in a lot of his students falling behind. In the first year, my supervisor made me write a review paper and resubmit it to 10 different journals over and over again even though the topic was nowhere near the level for those journals. It was simply for my supervisor to feed his own ego which resulted in most of my first year being spent writing and rewriting the same 5,000 word document to his pleasure. Luckily I was a quick worker and did most of my phd work in my second year, but my 3rd year was also full of random tasks and projects that my supervisor suddenly took interet in.

In others, you have creative agency in the process. You make creative suggestions and guide the work based on your developing expertise. Your PI is not your boss, they're your mentor. They don't tell you what to do, they make suggestions based on their understanding in the field. You have an entire committee you're meant to work with. If you don't like your PI you can switch. If you don't like a lab you can move. I get not everywhere is like that, but it's important that people know this difference.\n\n\nAlso, whether we like it or not, sometimes it does come down to work ethic. How effectively is a student working? I know students who refuse to start experiments (10-15 minutes) on weekends, which is totally fine, but will slow down their entire week. Biological experiments don't give a shit about your strict work preferences. 15 minutes on a Saturday could mean finishing an experiment 4 days sooner. That adds up. I worked at a lab once where the computational students would spend 2 hours an afternoon playing ping pong and dip out at 3 on Fridays. Again, that's fine, but it does add up, and that's not on the PI. \n\n\nAlso, a project/PhD will have bumps and detours. Some people do internships. I knew a student who did a fellowship at another university that added 2 years to their PhD. That wasn't on their PI. The pandemic derailed everyone's schedule. Sometimes PIs or collaborators move institutions and projects have to take a back seat. Again, not on the PIs project management skills. \n\n\nSometimes materials don't come in time, or get contaminated. Sometimes equipment fails (my spouse's lab had their -80 fail a month ago, they lost a *lot* of work). \n\n\nSometimes new methods need to be developed. Sometimes students need to go to a summer workshop to learn new methods. Sometimes new methods are discovered that better answer your research questions, so you have to start parts of your projects over. None of this is a dependent on a PI's project management.\n\n\nThis doesn't include funding struggles out of the PIs control. Mental health struggles by students that even the most supportive PI can't alleviate. Teaching duties taking up more time than they're meant too. University politics mucking up the process. Simply getting scooped by some random lab doing similar work. Publishers taking forever getting papers pushed out. Family troubles. Societal distractions making concentration really hard. \n\n\n\n&gt;To my mind as someone who has worked for so long\n\nI think this is just silly. PhDs are not office jobs. They're not teaching gigs. They're not tutors. They're not even lab techs. PhDs are teaching you to be the most creative and capable and ground breaking experts in a field. There's almost no other position that compares to a PhD because doing a PhD is learning how to be completely novel, in highly technical fields. There's almost nothing else that demands that of you. \n\n\nAsk an author how long it takes to write a completely original book, or an artist how long it takes to create a completely unique gallery installation. \n\n\nPIs are important, and can make or break an experience, but let's not pretend this is as simple as \"*do they have good project management skills*\".

Poorly structured research programs which have the express intent of either expanding the research profile of the university (supervisors) in order to seek grants in \"hot topic areas\", treating PhD programs as simply a cheap source of labour, lying to students about what they are sacrificing and the realities of applying for the few academic openings that exists, or the fact you don't need most PhDs in industry cause you can make it with enough experience and a master's into research roles and or leadership roles or advisory/policy roles some of which are within these academic institutions.

The requirement came because my dumbass university made a list of \"approved journals\" from 2020 onwards. And guess what, my first publication isn't on that list (as it's a new Journal). I requested the university to reconsider as my paper got published before 2020.  No avail. \n\nAs my other paper is in review (which will take a long time due to the typical review time of the journal) I am in limbo right now, my funding is over, and in the 4th year of my Ph.D. If he had some sense of responsibility, he could have presented my case better to the University and I could have started proceedings leading up to the defense (by the time in which my 2nd paper would come).

A PhD will likely be in control of some of the creative aspects of the research and have some authority over the direction/workflow even when they first start. Having received an MS and now almost finished with my PhD, in my opinion (and the words of my supervisor), a PhD program trains you on how to answer scientific questions by designing, executing, and analyzing the data. It\u2019s not as much about the specific wet lab protocols or computational packages you gain experience with, but your ability to quickly learn new things and be extremely flexible intellectually. You have to amass a body of work by the end of the PhD in the form of a dissertation, have published (a lot of the time, at least one first author paper) to show you are able to have an impact in the field. You also often have teaching requirements, apply for fellowships, not to mention the crazy involved qualifying exams during your second year. In qualifying exams you are expected to be able to communicate and defend a thesis project to a panel of PIs who often have expertise in that exact field, and who can ask you anything they want during the several hour exam. There are more components to that, but I won\u2019t get into it. Also, the PhD is a good two years of quite advanced coursework, all while rotating in labs trying to prove yourself/ become matched with a supervisor. After that you have about 4 years of straight 40+ weeks of intense experimental design, seminars, conferences, collaborations, meetings, etc\u2026 in comparison, I\u2019d say the MS is more of an advanced undergraduate degree. It usually takes 2 years, you have a high ratio of coursework to lab work, and you are not as independent. Granted, you usually have a thesis to write and some sort of defense, but it is way lower intensity and smaller in scale. Everyone\u2019s experience is different, but in my opinion, the PhD trains you in a way of thought, scientific communication, independence, and professionalism far beyond an MS.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vuxc2v/phds_that_are_too_long_to_complete_are/ifigpm2/"}, "1987": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "dzalf", "Date": 1657397366, "Score": 1, "Body": "-\"Has Mendeley crashed too many times this week?\"\n\n-... \n\n-\"There, there.

I think you're correct that a terminal MA is more akin to an undergraduate degree program, but my question wasn't about terminal MAs.  Instead, I'm wondering why people feel the need to continue in their PhD.  Why not just 'master out' of a program after qualifying exams  (especially if conditions are as bad as OP say they are).  As you mentioned, qualifying exams are extraordinarily rigorous, and test not only one's knowledge of the field, but the candidate's intellectual/creative abilities.  I'm not in the sciences, but by the time I went through my quals, I had already a number of independent research projects under my belt (many were published or on their way to being published).  So.. returning to my original question: is there real value in continuing in the PhD program?  From my own experience as a humanist, the dissertation is extraordinarily valuable because tenure decisions are largely determined by whether one can publish a book (and an excellent dissertation can turn into an excellent book).  So, if one's aim is tenure, there is real value in continuing with the PhD.  I still don't see how continuing with the PhD bestows value in the laboratory sciences (where the vast majority of people have no hope of securing a TT)... it still strikes me very much as a credential.

So, I still wonder the following: if one has made it through quals and has proven that they can engage in independent research and are 'scientifically mature,' why stay on in the PhD program?  The only answer that seems sensible here is that the PhD program is a credential.  Failure to jump through this last hoop means you won't be able to progress as far in industry.\n\n\"Let me ask you this, though. Given your questions, do you believe that a non-terminal MA and PhD are the same?\"\n\nI'm not quite sure what you have in mind by non-terminal MA.  If by this you mean the degree you get after passing quals and then existing the PhD program, then my answer is that in many cases there might not be much of a difference between non-terminal MA and PhD.  In my own case, there wouldn't have been too much difference in terms of value between these two degrees.  After quals, I wrote a few more papers and stapled them together for a dissertation (this is unusual for a humanist, though.  As I mention, books are the norm).  Sure, I benefited from discussing papers with peers and my mentor, but I still discuss my papers with my peers and mentor post -PhD.  So in my case (and once again, I think I am pretty unusual for the humanities), going the extra mile and completing the PhD didn't bestow any value -- I had already done a lot of work prior to quals and post-quals was a period of peace and quiet where I could write a few more papers.  Finishing the PhD allowed me to apply for TT jobs, though.  So I think in my own case, the PhD was really more of a credential (a 'useless' degree that is nonetheless necessary to move up the ranks).  It strikes me that many in STEM are in a similar situation, and it is all the more heartbreaking because -- unlike myself -- they seem to really, really dislike their PhD experience.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vuxc2v/phds_that_are_too_long_to_complete_are/ifinos4/"}, "1997": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1657401051, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post has been flaired as \u201cVent\u201d.

This is a life decision you are committing the next 4-7 years of your life toward so a campus visit may be worth sacrificing a little money toward just to assure you made the right decision. You get to hear their pitch about their program, ask any questions you may have, get to know a few professors or two, and get a feel for the vibe you are getting from the program. While this is not generalizable across all campus visits, if you planned your visit for sometime in the fall when classes are in session, at least at my institution, the program allows you to sit in on one of the courses that they have on the given day you come for your campus visit. What was helpful for prospective students when I gave a few of them a campus visit is I allowed them to ask any questions they had that they wouldn't feel comfortable asking to professors within the program. This included questions regarding: student/program atmosphere, support by professors, quality of the program, courses offered, life in the city the university was located, etc. \n2. **Do some background research**: If the institution has a doctoral program page, I'd pull it up and see the bio pages for the tenured faculty they have in their department. I'd look at the courses they teach, their research interests, and what they've published recently. Again, if you have a chance to ask about these professors from current students or meet them during a Zoom/in-person campus visit, do so. The reason being is while there may be a faculty member who aligns or specializes in your research area/focus, that doesn't always mean you opt to choose them as an advisor. There are other factors to consider, such as: do they offer you the type of support you need (emotional, easy to contact/meet with), do they offer clear and concise feedback, and a question I tell all doctoral students to ask themselves when choosing a doctoral advisor, which is \"do I trust this person to get me out of here in 5-years or less?\" You can absolutely love a professor, enjoy taking their class, and respect them as academics and still opt to not choose them as a dissertation advisor. It's all about fit and what you need in terms of support during the dissertation process. For me, my advisor is not an expert on my dissertation topic, but I chose him because of his feedback style, ease of getting in contact with, easy going style, and offering the type of support I required from a advisor. You can always have your 2 readers play the role of your \"expert\" for your dissertation committee. That's what I did for my dissertation committee. In some cases also, while professors may be very reputable and well-established within a field, they may be complete dickwads or egomaniacs, and thus, may be hell to work with. Thus, it's always nice to ask around or see what the reputation or personalities are like of other faculty within a particular program if possible. \n3. **Don't be mislead by the \"size\" or \"lack of reputation\" of the school**: I'm finishing up a doctoral degree in Composition at an institution that has a faltering reputation within my particular field. While my institution is small in size and may not have the reputation it once did, we have professors that are quite well-known within their particular, niche field of research (transfer, rhetoric, identity, etc.). One has to remember that not all professors opt to teach at large, R1 universities. The factors that play into a professor opting for a small, less prestigious institution includes, but is not specific to just: family decisions, pay, course load, timing of the job opening, research opportunities, cost of living, tenure-track opportunities, etc. \n4. **At the end of the day, you still have to sell yourself and your research interests (Ex. Dissertation topic) to potential employers:** Whether you go to a big name school or not, the point here is name value of a institution only gets you so far. When you're in front of a hiring committee for a job interview, you're going to have to sell your self, your skills/knowledge, your research interests (dissertation research), and the benefit you bring to a company.

He ultimately lost his own fight with his illness and everyone dealt with achieving their own PhD goals differently, one even quit entirely taking this as a sign not to be a scientist. \n\nMy best advice is to look for things that elevate your paper to their critical list. Can they be counciled or scolded by a coauthor, their boss, a friend? Are you able to back channel things to achieve this affect?\n\nNext is to appeal to their empathy. Go to their office and beg. Crying / getting choked up with emotional pain can help. Offer to break it up into small pieces that you review together at their convenience. Offer to have someone else do the work e.g. a postdoc in the lab. \n\nInvestigate your legal alternatives. Can you change labs and take your thesis with you. Can you submit without their input. Would you be able to change labs entirely and do an abbreviated thesis given your circumstances? You will need to set a meeting with the head of graduate studies to learn your options here.\n\nRepeat all the above until you succeed or run out of time on your personal or institutional  clock and quit.

The ranking doesn\u2019t mean too much between the top 10-15 schools other than broadly impressive names like MIT and Berkeley standing out.

That\u2019s both current and visiting students. Top departments will do good research, so mostly just try to be happy wherever you end up. \n\n3. Talk to current students and see if a PI seems respectful and like a good leader. If you are at least a little interested in the research, having a good PI and group will be more than sufficient to get you through. \n\n4. My school is in a fairly small town with lots of nature, so that\u2019s been super helpful!

You're sensitive to her phrasing and, although you say you don't, it definitely sounds like you *do* discredit her struggles. (To be clear: you could be totally right to discredit them, I dunno... but reread those two sentences---- you reduce things like \"her mom is sick\" to \"something wrong\" in a very dismissive way. And later, you call them \"excuses.\" Pretty discrediting!) And you're right, too; there are likely much better, more constructive ways to comment on a draft than to just write \"ouch.\" \n\nYou don't seem terrible... but based on this, she doesn't either. (She seems a bit autistic, if I'm being honest.) She tries to admit that part of the problem is her fault, after all. I tend to agree with you (that she is disrepectful), but maybe to her point: isn't \"egregiously disrespectful,\" like... redundant? Like, is there some acceptable amount of disrespect? I could see her interpreting \"ouch\" as trying to be 'jokey' about a situation she feels she has to address. It's not at all constructive, but she may think being constructive has been meaner than making a joke and hoping you come up with an edit that you're both amenable to. (Again, I'd agree with you that this isn't a good strategy; I am just trying to put myself in her position.) Furthermore, you note that she *used* to be constructive - if she's still not getting what she wants, maybe \"ouch\" is her way of throwing up her hands and admitting that constructive criticism wasn't working.\n\nIn any event, the scenario seems to be that you don't find her struggles valid (and perhaps you are right!) and you don't vibe with her communication style, at least anymore. From her side, she's dissatisfied with your work now (despite little evidence that she has any valid reason to be) and her shift from constructive to flippant may indicate that she's as much at wit's end as you are, and is doing a crummy job of expressing it in part due to her (from her perspective, quite valid!) struggles.\n\nIf you can continue to progress somehow without working together, I'd recommend doing that - it sounds like it'd be better for both of you. (With just the two other advisors, maybe?) And if not, I guess I can only give advice to you (she's not here): try to put yourself in her shoes when interpreting her harsh commentary. From her perspective: her mom and dog are sick and things are pretty bad, and she's failed to get whatever she thinks she should be getting from you, and she's tried 'constructive' in the past, but what she's getting (to be clear: *in her mind*, not necessarily in reality) evinces that constructive criticism isn't producing the desired results.\n\nLastly, even if you're 100% right (remember, this is unlikely even for the \"rightest\" among us), my advice would still be pretty similar: get away if you can and, if not, reduce the psychic trauma you endure by doing your best to project into her shoes and interpret her actions from her perspective.

Some insecurity is normal and good for productivity and motivation, but important to try to see past it when it gets out of hand.\n\nWith regards to time-frames. I wouldn't worry about comparing your age to other graduates. It tends to be that in school and academia we all try to rush through at the same time.

Here it goes :P\n\nThe idea of the DCIM (discrete complex image method) is to approximate or fit a spectral function by a sum of exponentials by finding the poles and residues using the GPOF (generalized pencil of function) method. In the case of an electric field, the resulting function has the same form as if it was produced by multiple images of the source charge for which the distances  are complex numbers.\n\nI'm trying to reproduce the results from the following paper:\n\n[SHOORY, A.; MOINI, R.; SADEGHI, S.

The spectral electric field (Green's function) are sampled, then fitted by the DCIM. Now here is the problem I'm facing: when I try to fit the field E1, the residues are exploding (NaN's and Inf).

I was so depressed, taken advantaged of by my senior, pushed aside by my PI because my senior and her bffl were important for the lab while I was leaving, and my committee didn't help because they were collaborators of my PI or they were too busy to care since my PI was paying me and letting me graduate.

I procrastinated/acted as a depressed person for 95% of the time and that was OKAY. It is ok to not want to write. You just need to write it, even if it is your worst writing work. I wrote each subtopic in my introduction one at a time, edited it before I moved to the next topic, and never read it again...even when I was putting my thesis together at the end. I procrastinated my conclusion until the day before it was due and I wrote it in one morning (8-12) because I was physically sick of looking at and thinking about my thesis. But of course, I had my topics outlined but not having to reference every sentence, like in the introduction, made the writing really fast. No one on your committee cares about the substance of your thesis. They just care if it is done or not done. \n\nAfter I finished half of my introduction, I started applying for industry positions and spent a month on getting my next job. It was a good break and gave me hope while I was deep in depression. \n\nMoney and leaving academia were the huge motivating factors. My salary almost triple in one month after I moved to industry (I defended at the beginning of the month and started my job at the end). I dont work after 5pm or weekend, I continue to do discovery research, I feel appreciated because my company pays me for my worth, I don't have to play politics for paper authorships, everyone works as a team to push projects to clinical trials for real-life impact, and success of the company translates to more money for me.

Some people may take longer, but they might be very productive during that period and accumulate more experience and achievements (e.g., more projects, more papers, more networking with other professors).

And you don\u2019t have the luxury of taking extended time off anyway because\u2026\n\nSecond, it\u2019s financially stressful. Your stipend (if you even get one) is usually at or below the cost of living for your area. You will have little or no safety net for unforeseen events/circumstances unless you have significant savings coming in. You\u2019re likely to accrue debt, even living fairly frugally. And I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019s like in an unpaid program where you\u2019re given nothing and expected to pay tuition.\n\nThird, it\u2019s a straight-up unhealthy work-life balance. You start to feel guilty for every moment you spend doing anything except working, because you *could always* be working, and not working is just delaying your progress. You can\u2019t even enjoy your time off because you can\u2019t help but feel guilty in the back of your mind. There is no balance. Only stress.\n\nFinally, stress in general. I\u2019m not paid enough to do the things I do, and I\u2019m expected to be *grateful* for the *gift* of the income I receive. And I am. But man, this job isn\u2019t worth it. There\u2019s a hypothetical light at the end of the tunnel, but you get *nothing* along the journey. It\u2019s the ultimate test of your capacity for delayed gratification. How many consecutive years of no reward whatsoever can you put up with for a nebulously-defined reward at the end that they totally promise is worth it?\n\nPeople drop out of PhD programs all the time.

To clarify, for this degree I produced a 21,000-word thesis in less than 5 months. Many experienced academics I talked to told me despite the quality of honours degree output cannot be as perfect as PhD's, honours degree is way less manageable than PhD for many many many people.\n\nI had a similar experience with you - I skipped entire days and mucked around. I watched NBA finals, went out with my girlfriend who was my honours degree fellow, and did many many other things. One thing I found quite important is that I recognised the loss I made from these muckarounds, so I would make up for what I left behind the next day. Here's a few things I found quite inspiring:\n\n* I rewarded myself big time. For example I bought myself a Razer keyboard once I cleansed my initial data. I never had coding experience so that was really hard for me. And I forced myself to close Razer website unless I made some progress. I rushed to the digital market first thing in the next morning to buy the keyboard.\n* Find a partner to work with. For me it was my girlfriend. She did completely different topics, but that didn't stop us working together. We would go to school together, sitting side by side. During working hours we strictly limited our interactions on work only. No food or vacation discussion. We monitored each other. You can talk to a fellow candidate and ask hey you keen to squad up with me and monitor each other during work hours? We can game together or hang out together after work.\n* Polish your work environment. We each had a locker in our office, and enough desk space. I had all snacks, tea bags, a mug, and everything I need to make myself comfortable. I left my gaming mouse in the office so I'd want to work in the office to use that mouse. My office is even more comfortable than home in terms of working.\n* Be instinctive to impulsive ideas. I wonder if you feel the same way - the days you do absolutely nothing are usually the days where you have no inspirations? You don't have any ideas, so of course you don't want to do anything, cause you don't even know what to do! It's totally normal. Be honest with yourself. If you have no inspirations today, fuck it, call it a day (even if it's only 2 pm), go home, shower, game a bit, then sleep early. But when you for a second come across an idea, fuck anything you're doing, grab your gear, rush to your office, start working. This is the typical me: once I have an idea, I don't care what day it is or what I'm doing, I'll grind until I fully redeem my ideas. So more often than not I wrote 0 word on Monday, 0 word on Tuesday, but 3000 words on Wednesday. On average it's still 1000 word/day, but I enjoyed my free time and I validated my impulsive ideas (even tho sometimes they didn't yield significant results).\n* (Personal) Get yourself a decent pair of headphones and good music. I find myself productive when listening to classic piano music. So I just randomly typed in \"piano\" in Apple Music and played the radio station in my headphones and started working. These days I found Lofi music very very calming and fit for work. I played \"lofi girl\" streaming on YouTube. I see hundreds of similar people in the chatbox of that channel.\n* Don't draw clear boundaries between weekdays and weekends. The research is your own stuff, and you have to be responsible for it. Taking weekends for granted when you have an idea is disrespectful to yourself, so is forcing yourself to work on weekdays when you have no inspirations. When you do your own research, there are only workdays, and offdays. Any days when you have ideas are workday even if it's Saturday, any days when you have no ideas are offdays even if it's Monday (given you don't have other things to do at school).", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vwczsa/how_often_do_you_have_days_where_you_do/iftw6d5/"}, "2541": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "REC_HLTH", "Date": 1657611682, "Score": 2, "Body": "1) Yes, that sounds feasible.

I will first say that coming up with a research topic for a dissertation or any research paper at the doctoral level for that matter can be tough at times. Within our respective fields, there can sometimes feel like there are endless sub-genres and areas of research that can be explored. This can be both a positive and negative thing. On one hand, you have a plethora of research areas to look into and choose as a research topic. On the other hand, it can feel overwhelming and you may feel some hesitancy in regards to determining what is relevant within the field and worth researching. In saying that........\n2. The skill of self-independence should be a common character trait showcased by students, especially at the doctoral level. The rhetorical question I pose to my students when they slacking is \"do you consider yourself a grown ass, independent man or woman? When they answer yes, I follow up with \"if you consider yourself a grown ass, independent man or woman, should you not showcase grown ass, independent man or woman characteristics?\" Point being, I couldn't call myself \"independent\" if I relied on another man or woman to do work that I know damn well I should be doing and dare I say is a \"right of passage\" that has been undertaken by hundreds, if not thousands of doctoral students before me within the same program, and other doctoral programs within the same institution. To each their own, but as much as being a doctoral student has sucked something awful at times (and extended periods of time at that), I want to feel like I actually earned that degree and didn't have it merely given to me. Going through the struggle is part of the journey and actually putting in the work to research an area within your field, looking through mounds of research (books, dissertations, journal articles, etc.), identifying a gap in the literature/research, and discovering a research topic that could benefit the field is most certainly part of that journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I love research and I have a few broad areas of interest, but I am honestly not that fussed about the specific topic or research question. I want my PhD to be useful and fit within the field.\n\n\\^ This issue here with this statement is I think an issue of perspective, specifically \"tunnel vision\" versus \"long-term vision.\" You state that \"\\[you\\] want my PhD to be useful and fit within the field,\" which to me, implies that your just focusing short-term on being given a topic that could fulfill your dissertation requirement and be viewed as a contribution to the field. That's fine, but again, what gives me pause is the first half of your statement when you said \"But I am honestly not that fussed about the specific topic or research question.\" That to me is a red flag of sorts. I am well aware that not everybody who gets a doctoral degree opts to continue on in a career as a postsecondary professor or researcher. However, if you are, I'd imagine you have to have an authentic, passionate tie to a research topic(s) that you yourself came across and invested yourself in over an extended period of time. Being invested in a research topic is how  someone stays dedicated to researching and publishing journal articles and books within the field well after you've obtained your doctoral degree and you're fully into your career as an academic. I have serious doubts about researchers adding to the body of knowledge of a field if it were potentially filled with academics who were merely just given a research topic and don't truly have a passion for the topic at all. To end this point, you state that social science professors know the field and literature very well, likely from their decades within the field itself, both teaching and researching. However, with each passing year, the OG professors retire and the young blood comes in. If the younger generation of academics don't develop their base knowledge by putting in their blood, sweat, and tears (time) into establishing their keen understanding of their field and research interest(s), how can one expect to continue on the cycle of having social science professors who are well-versed and knowledgeable in they field and the literature?

This sounds kind of crazy but I had an advisor who expected us to basically take notes on interesting things we saw to include the PI of the person presenting (if a student) and the university they were from, but he only told us of this expectation after we got back and we were all first years. That being said doing this at future conferences was actually super helpful for finding relevant papers later so I\u2019d recommend some amount of note taking regardless. It\u2019s easy to forget all of the stuff you see and hear in a day at a conference and jotting down some notes will be super helpful later. \n\nWrt dress code that sort of depends on the conference/field, but you\u2019ll probably be ok with some business casual clothes and if you\u2019re in doubt go a bit nicer to avoid feeling weird and young and underdressed (feeling underdressed made me feel more like a baby compared to experienced researchers than I was already feeling early on). \n\nI do feel for you going by yourself.

First thing is there is a lot of key details missing in this post and it's somewhat vague. From what I gather, your issue is homegirl has a Ph.D already and because you are still in the process of obtaining your own doctoral degree, she gives off that \"I'm more of an expert and possess more knowledge on a given topic than you\" type swag. She views her doctoral degree as all the proof needed to put herself on a higher pedestal than you on this project, research study, or co-published paper (was not clear what you two are working on). To this I say, this does not seem like anything out of the ordinary when it comes to the realm of academia and the type of people you would come across in that environment. Based off your description of this woman, words that come to mind to describe her are: confident, egomaniac, elitist, prideful, expert, etc. Again, regardless of country, institution, department, and degree program, you'd find a student or professor who could be described using one of these words.\n2. A question I have is was this project optional or are you bound to this project and working with this individual?\n3. There is a saying, \"A closed mouth doesn't get fed.\" Like several posters have alluded to, I can tell by your post that your pride has been damaged and there is some deep animosity toward this person. If your description and interactions with this individual are true, I definitely could relate to and understand how you feel. In saying that, before I make the decision to bring in outside help (from a professor or supervisor), I would definitely try to handle it myself. If I consider myself a grown ass, independent man/woman, I would showcase those very characteristics by pulling this individual aside and telling her how I feel. I would tell her specifically what actions by her have offended me and to please stop and respect me as a fellow academic. If you need to give her a subtle, G-check (gangsta check) and push back verbally to show her you are not a doormat or a \"little bitch,\" that would be fair as well. Again, supervisors and professors don't have time for this high school drama BS, they got more important things to attend to. Thus, I would only go to them as a last resort and only after I've attempted to solve this issue myself first.\n4. The part regarding how she \"she just blurts her ideas out orally\" sounds like she's an oral learner and this is clashing with your own learning style. I may be wrong, but without more detail, I'm only speculating here. While I'm a visual learner, there are instances where I verbalize an idea or point I'm attempting to make (for my dissertation), but I don't have the name of a researcher(s) or author(s) off the top of my head. One thing that may help is finding a happy medium in terms of a system where you can bth work productively while catering to each other's learning style.\n5. I'd find a research study or journal article from your field and go directly to the \"analysis\" section. I would point out the fact to her that previous research and a call back to previous studies is indeed the norm within this section of a journal article/research paper and is vital to making the overall point you are attempting to make for your own project/study. I would make it crystal clear to homegirl that a author's \"doctoral degree\" or call to the reader to \"put trust in an author's knowledge of the field and recollection of past study's data from memory\" is not a sufficient enough reason to not cite one's sources. Doctoral students, doctoral degree holders, academics, professors, and well renowned scholars are not above the established rules set by academic institutions and scholarly journals.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/vzqfz2/dealing_with_young_but_na\u00efve_phd_pretending_to_be/igabv77/"}, "3210": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Agreeable-Sport6623", "Date": 1657905126, "Score": 1, "Body": "I disagree with most of these comments.

Person Z could be in a program that has clear outlines and boundaries and both person z and advisor know exactly what they are doing with amicability and clear guidance and direction, whereas person m is in another space altogether.\n\nThere is just so much that can move one away from the research, but my advice is to just focus on finishing the piece of research as much as possible and pay only minimal level of awareness to everything else that isn\u2019t about leveraging your career, keeping yourself healthy, and eventually seeing your degree as a small piece towards making socially beneficial and personally meaningful impact.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w0fyzq/why_is_almost_everyone_so_toxic/igep1m5/"}, "3422": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "nnomadic", "Date": 1657987312, "Score": 6, "Body": "Some people use their degree as a way to help people, others use it as a cudgel.

They will shelf a product that the world needs if their marketing research does not show that the product can be marketable. No one is willing to work for free, not you nor I. And companies are looking to invest in something that can generate the most profits for them. That said, it is naive to believe that any research or products can be put out into the world for people to actually use if it isn't due to the work of pharm companies. Research that comes out from academia lab alone cannot and will not get through clinical trials, FDA approval, large scale/high QC production, etc without pharm companies. The actual corruption comes from the lacking US policies (assuming you're in the US) that allow pharm companies to charge an arm and a leg for the same products that only cost a fraction overseas. Insulin cost ~$10 in other developed and developing countries while it cost $100 in america. HIV PREP (truvade) cost $10 per month in Australia but $500 per month in the United States. Is it immortal for pharm companies to charge the same product at different prices? Yes. But you cannot argue for a capitalism society (over socialism or communism, etc) while hope that companies will care for people over profit. That is the role of the government. If you want to make HUGE impacts, then maybe policy making may be another option aside from industry or academic jobs. \n\nAside note, academia also cares about money, and you get promoted based on how much money you can bring in. Example, in my PhD institute, postdocs need a K01 or any grant to be promoted to research assistant professor, and from there a R21 or of similar $$ value in order to be internally promoted to assistant professor. Hiring committees will also consider your potentials in bringing in grant money as a decision factor, as universities get a sizable portion of all grants. And even if you get in, your lab size and position are tied to how much money you can continue to bring in.

Do they tend to write dry, jargon-filled methods papers? Or is your field more subjective, with some 'as left to the reader' type nuances? Or is your field more about demonstrating some technical novelty? We can't speak for you there but chances are your PI and your colleagues can refer you to the Big Names in your field. If your group does a Journal Club, pick a few noteworthy articles and really dig into how they wrote it.\n\nRead their work, get a feel for how they write, and you'll find yourself emulating it in no time. That brings me to point number two:\n\n**On Writing:**\n\nYour first few pieces of writing are going to suck. Chances are, you're going to continue to suck for a while until you have enough experience/revisions/metaphorical beatdowns from reviewers/PIs/colleagues to get your own work published, and even then you're still going to look back at your previous work one day and wonder who wrote such garbage =P\n\nIt may feel harsh, but it's true, and almost everyone starts out the same way. Academic writing is completely different than other kinds of writing, and like you say, you're making a jump from undergrad/masters' level to PhD levels.\n\nSome tips: \n\n* Practice writing, even if it's just a GoogleDoc where you start bashing out methods or the beginning bits of an introduction. \n\n* No matter the paper, make an outline that crafts your general theme/narrative, fill it in with loose bullet points / data, and then fill in the rest as you go. If you're in a STEM-type field, start planning out what your Figures will look like, because it becomes a heck of a lot easier planning what your paper is going to look like if you know what the pictures are going to look like, because face it - no one really fully reads papers in their entirety anyway; they read the title, skim the abstract, focus on the figures, and then skim the rest.\n\n* **'Perfect' is the mortal enemy of 'good enough'** - don't fall into the trap. You'll be tempted to stare at a blank page for a while, writing and erasing and writing and erasing while you search for the perfect phrase - don't do that; just vomit your stream of consciousness onto the page and then go back and edit it later. \n\nGood luck!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w1kbw5/starting_my_phd/igkylhz/"}, "3631": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1658104096, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

Apply for a doctoral training programme in your field of interest and if you get accepted, you then get to choose a project from the ones they offer (I did this, pros: they are usually okay with people not having a lot of experience, as that is the whole point of the programme. cons: if you have a very specific project in mind, it might not be the best choice). \n\n2. Apply for a PhD that is being advertised. pros: you apply directly for the project you want to do. cons: you will compete against people with a lot of niche knowledge around that specific project and here it might matter more if you don't have a Master's.\n\n3. If you have a very specific thing you want to research, you look for possible supervisors and contact them telling them about yourself and your project idea and seeing if they have any way of taking you in. pros: you have more control over what and where you research. cons: unlikely that they will already have funding available when someone emails them about a random project, you might have to apply for funding separately.\n\nAs someone who did a PhD via option 1 without having a Master's degree when I applied, I definitely recommend it.

This varies somewhat between fields, but in a top program, students do not pay; the university pays the students. This has changed due education funding cuts. But the top programs still operate this way. Also, this is one major difference between the PhD (a scholarly degree) and masters' degrees (usually unfunded) and \"professional\" terminal degrees (e.g. JDs, MDs, EDs, etc.) (also usually unfunded).\n\nFor example, at the university where I graduated in 2020, PhD tuition is officially $50k/year. But the PhD students (international and domestic) sign contracts upon admission that include 5+ years of free tuition, monthly stipends, and health insurance (for themselves and their dependents). They also have access childcare subsidies and emergency funds (e.g., international travel due to family emergencies). So, when all is said and done, the students actually receive $30k+ year plus health insurance. Not much, but livable for a single person. These funds are not loans, they are completely separate from federal financial aid, and are thus available international students too.\n\nFunding is one reason why admission to these programs is so competitive. It's also one reason why these PhDs are done in person. Even though the top students in the top programs may be paid via fellowship (i.e., they are simply paid to attend class and do their own research), funding is often organized around teaching and research assistant positions, etc. You need to be in person to do those work activities. Also, top departments usually have additional recruitment funds. For example, I know of one particularly competitive international student who negotiated a higher paid contract because his wife, who came with him, couldn't legally work for a U.S. company, and because he was also supporting his kids. That might be unusual but it gives you a sense of how the system works.\n\nRelocation costs are something to consider, as is is the opportunity cost for your (or your spouse) who might be leaving a job. (These are the dreaded \"opportunity costs.\") A remote PhD may make it more accessible for you if you don't want leave or can't leave your home. That's wonderful. However, I'd hate to see you limit yourself to an online PhD simply because you think it will save you money.  When all is said and done, if you gain admission to a fully funded program, a remote PhD would the more expensive option. (On a side note: unfunded in-person PhD would be the worst of both worlds. You'd have to pay tuition for a lower ranking program and and you'd have to move.)\n\nPart of the stigma surrounding online PhDs is that they charge for tuition. Such programs prey on people's ignorance by making students pay for something that is historically and, often still, \"free.\" They exploit the people that can't get into top programs by charging them for the privilege of earning a meaningless credential. Unlike bachelors, masters, or professional degrees, the PhD credential is not about the knowledge you learn from classes you take (though some are definitely required). Rather, it reflects that you have acquired new knowledge (from classes) and then applied that in a tightly monitored and highly rigorous setting to create and contribute new knowledge that is relevant to pushing the science of your field forward. The purpose of your time in a PhD is to create *new* *knowledge* and *new methods* (not just new products). The only way to objectively evaluate whether or not you've done that is through rigorous peer review (e.g., years of close mentorship, comprehensive exams, dissertation, etc.) Does the online PhD offer that?\n\nThink about it from the perspective of scientists. I've never met anyone who would argue that a PhD is required to create new knowledge; certainly not! But if you are already creating new knowledge, just publish that, undergo peer review, and don't bother with the PhD.  Think about it this way; a university can't write exams or offer classes for knowledge/concepts that haven't yet been created.\n\nThe stigma is also about the quality of the education you receive, which is not comparable. All of that may sound harsh, but it's just reality.\n\nIf you just want to put the letters behind your name, you certainly can pay for that privilege by taking and passing some interesting classes that will undoubtedly teach you something new. Will that impress non-PhDs? Maybe. Will that grant you the ability to speak with objective authority in your field? Assuming you aren't already an authority, no it will not, because the peer review in those programs is inferior to absent (e.g., loose comps and dissertation requirements, if any). Again, if you already are an authority in your field, you'd be better off just publishing the new knowledge that you developed and not even bothering with the PhD. Will you receive the same caliber of training and discipline had you enrolled in a traditional program that requires 60 hours/week of classwork/research,  grants you access to start of the art lab and equipment time, and puts you under the mentorship of cutting edge experts over 5 years? Absolutely not.\n\nAn online PhD may be totally the right fit for you. But as far as cost, don't be deceived. Carefully consider what you are paying for. Opportunity costs aside, any PhD that you have to pay for is more expensive than one that you get paid to do.\n\nEdits: spelling and clarity", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w1xng4/id_like_to_hear_your_thoughts_on_a_distance_based/ignw5fb/"}, "3758": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "gradthrow59", "Date": 1658165711, "Score": 3, "Body": "while some of those platitudes are meaningless, the fact of the matter is that you couldn't get *into a program* if you weren't supposed to. your presence there means that you belong there.\n\nthe problems you describe with your supervisor and generally being ignored by your program are not reflective of your ability, but rather a huge failing in educational responsibility by the people in charge of educating you. it's a really unfortunate situation that sadly, many do go through as \"part of the process\", but that doesn't make it right.\n\nyou must have a committee or someone overseeing your progress, right? my goal at your stage would be to finish my dissertation and get out ASAP.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w23h5t/6_years_of_failure/igo1rfl/"}, "3759": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Musicianboy98", "Date": 1658165980, "Score": 43, "Body": "I have read over someone's statement of purpose for a management PhD and it was a legit train wreck. \n- they would say social psychology instead of management \n- grammatical and punctuation errors everywhere \n- structure was an absolute mess \n- they would talk about a different school instead of the school they are applying to.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w215sh/what_are_the_some_of_the_most_commonworst/igo2g7h/"}, "3760": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Musicianboy98", "Date": 1658166052, "Score": 6, "Body": "Be careful of online PhDs...", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w1xng4/id_like_to_hear_your_thoughts_on_a_distance_based/igo2muh/"}, "3761": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "VWMMXIX", "Date": 1658166727, "Score": 4, "Body": "Consider doing a Professional Doctorate.

There are some programmes with deadlines in December, but usually there's also plenty that advertise at different times of year. Individual projects (as opposed to doctoral programmes) will get advertised at random times of the year, based on when the supervisor manages to get funding, etc. You can start checking if there are any doctoral training programmes that would cater to your interests, and see when those in particular start recruiting.\n\nI think provided that you integrate the experience you described into your CV and have a good cover letter (+ good marks from your previous academic degree), it could definitely get you through to interviews in most programmes, but past that, it all rests on how well you perform on the day of the interview. \n\nThen for your last question, I think yeah, if we're talking about a very prestigious MIT-Harvard programme, it's likely it could give you an edge over other candidates in terms of your CV later on, but it would be more like \"oh we're gonna interview 5 people for the job, first this guy from the MIT-Harvard programme, next this other guy from this other programme etc.\". So maybe you'd jump up by 1-2 positions, in the list of preferences initially, which might get you an interview you wouldn't have otherwise got, 1 out of 10 times or so... Not sure how it is over there, but here what university you attend stops being important after undergrad/master's and it starts being a lot more about whose group you were in, what papers you published, which journals you published in, what conferences you attended etc. The differene between the \\*most\\* prestigious programme and the next one could be big, but after that, the difference between the 2nd and the 3rd, or the 3rd and the 6th is much less. To sumarise, yeah, if you were gonna go to the BEST programme in the country for something, it could open a few extra doors, but it probably would be a very small part of what makes you a good candidate.

In that way, it's not a waste, it's just a different path. Like others have said, there are parts of the experience that will just come far easier to us than younger students. You're obviously doing a PhD for the right reasons, and you've had more time to think about this. Also, what's the alternative? Going back to a factory and still not having much money?

Judging by the fact that you were hospitalized for several days, you had some type of minor surgery or a serious infection, etc.? Of course, you need to rest and you will need time to adjust back to your old routine!  (And resting isn't just sleeping, you can rest by doing things that you like, spending time on hobbies, etc. Resting isn't a strictly physical thing but also a mental vacation.)\n\nAre there funding issues with your PhD like you need to be done strictly by a certain semester and getting even a one-semester extension wouldn't be possible under any circumstances? If that is the case, l might understand the motivation behind feeling pressured to go back to work immediately but otherwise, of course, things will take time, and you deserve a break during your healing process (i mean you would deserve a break anyway even if you have to finish at a certain time that's very close).\n\nWith that said, if getting back to work slowly makes you feel better and sharper, of course, continue with it. I totally feel like once \"my engine stops\", it's a lot harder to \"re-start\" it so I tend to plan some light work around as long as I'm feeling well even at times l feel like I'm ahead of schedule.  (I absolutely make sure I get a full-on break for at least a week per semester though. In fact, I'm working on making it two weeks per total per semester with no work at all, plus taking the weekends off consistently). But the pace you're at sounds perfectly reasonable, and it is normal that it takes more time for you to internalize or understand things after not being healthy for a while (medication &amp; anesthesia, etc. might also contribute to feeling foggy, and illness/infection/exhaustion, etc. definitely causes fogginess). I would absolutely not advise pushing yourself too much, bc not taking things slowly when you need them and when you can afford it just makes it so that your body and mind decide when to take the next break, and chances are it won't be a convenient time.\n\nAs far as I understood, your advisor is also on board with taking things slowly as you heal (as they should be). So I don't really see an issue here, you're doing perfectly fine. Even if you take the entire month to do things at a slower pace or take breaks here and there, it's very very unlikely to affect your overall finishing time or your overall progress. Doing mentally demanding work requires having a sharp and rested mind and body, and also many requirements or aspects of a PhD tend to get done in \"sprints\" simply because of the process of research, and the process of analyzing what's been obtained during research (this includes doing literature reviews or readings) is never a linear line anyway. \n\nAlso, depending on the major or the research, your current \"slow\" pace could even be considered a fast pace. Some people take breaks for an entire semester or they end up never recovering from something etc. so they keep working at a slower pace than their previous one permanently, and they still end up fine, especially if their advisor/PI is good at navigating his kinda change (which they should, or at least try ti become). There really isn't a set \"right\" pace in doing a PhD, since \"the ideal\" for every individual person (as a researcher AND personally -having different needs, responsibilities, goals, etc.) and every individual research will be different. Often times how fast you have to finish depends on practical or material things like how much or when you can get funding though. \n\nl wish you a speedy recovery, and please be mindful of getting the rest you need while you're adjusting back to your studies!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/w2rvjc/how_slow_is_too_slow/igs0g7i/"}, "3922": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Signal-Photograph-23", "Date": 1658238762, "Score": 2, "Body": "Thank for your suggestions.

I\u2019m doing it for the reason you mentioned - because I enjoy research and wanted to switch my career to something more research-based. I work full time and have a family, so it\u2019s been challenging and a sacrifice in a lot of different ways, but no regrets. I am the person I am because of the many years I worked in the field. That experience also made me the researcher I am. I also have about one-third of the stress that my classmates in my 20s do because more life and work experience seems to put things in perspective, and also I have confidence in my own work ethic and a pretty good understanding of my limitations mentally and physically, which I didn\u2019t have in my 20s. My time management is about 200x better too.\n\nI don\u2019t feel at all like an outsider. In fact, I\u2019d say my work in the field makes me a better student. \n\nTHAT SAID, the ONLY reason I decided to go back was the circumstances that allowed me to do it:\n\n1) My parents retired and my husband switched to working from home, which gives me a lot more help on the childcare front. \n\n2) We are in a stable place financially after scraping and saving through our 20s and 30s, and because of my job, even though I\u2019m doing school part time, I don\u2019t have to pay tuition - only fees, which I pay from savings.\n\n3) Even though I still work 40 hours a week, my job allows me a flexible schedule to attend class and my coworkers are *extremely* supportive. I could not afford to live on a $20k GA stipend (which is about what you could expect in my field of study). I need to work full time. So this was crucial.\n\n4) I\u2019m not interested in joining the tenure game or uprooting my family once I\u2019m done. I looked into options for non-tenured research positions in academia and in the public/private sector, and had many conversations with others about what my job options would be, before I even applied. Luckily, there are some good options for me, so that also sealed my decision.\n\n5) I wanted to have several years\u2019 experience in practice before seeking a PhD, both because I enjoy the work and wanted to get better at it, and also because people with PhDs in my field get shuttled straight to management positions. This would have prevented me from really immersing myself in practicing in my field and gaining a solid understanding.\n\nWithout one of those 5 factors, I would not have considered a PhD program, even though I always dreamed of doing research in the latter part of my career. It took many years for them all to align, but much sooner that I originally thought. I was thinking I wouldn\u2019t be able to enter a PhD program until my mid to late 40s, which would have been fine too.\n\nSo, there are a lot of personal things to consider when making this kind of sacrifice on your finances, time, and energy, plus the sacrifices your family makes by you spending time on school work.

In what should have been my final year, when I had overcome all these obstacles and was ready to start my user tests (literally had my first session booked at the end of the following week with an 'expert' in the field and a translator), the faculty moved me out of my office with no notice, then took months to organise a replacement room (some of the 'fun' included them losing my computer in the shift, not being able to give me a key for the new room because the previous occupant hadn't handed it in and apparently spare keys or getting a new one cut just aren't things that exist and taking 3 weeks to move my other furniture in there even though it should have taken like an hour at most). Because of these delays I had to cancel the sessions I had with the expert users, and when I went to rebook them there was a shortage of translators, so I had to wait another month).\n\nThese delays, coupled with the previous delays I'd faced, meant that I would not get my PhD finished before my deadline, and I'd already had to use my leave to absorb the delays with getting the system built. When I asked if I could get an extension to make up for these delays, I was told no and that I'd \"just have to discontinue\". The most frustrating thing was that all through that final year when this bullshit was happening, people in the faculty kept telling me to \"reach out for support\", but when I did reach out for support, I was basically told to go fuck myself. At that point I had a significant mental and physical health breakdown as well.\n\n3. **How did you go on professionally after?** Still working as a sessional TA and have also started lecturing. I was also asked to develop a unit for a new online Masters course and then ended up running that unit as well, so not bad in the professional regard.\n\n4. **Did you ever regret your decision? Why?** I regretted not discontinuing earlier. The wheels really started to fall off the project 3 years earlier and I should have discontinued then, or at the very least, I should have discontinued at the start of that final year when the faculty started fucking me over because it really became clear to me then that they didn't want me to finish (I still don't know why they treated me like that though because I had never had many encounters with them and when I did we were always cordial and friendly). I can't really regret 'choosing' to discontinue because it wasn't a choice, I was forced into it.\n\n5. **Would you consider going back and trying it again? Why?** After discontinuing there is a certain timeframe during which you are allowed to re-enrol and try to finish. I am still within that timeframe so I have been discussing things with my former supervisor to see if there is any way I can complete my project without having to rely on the faculty for support (ie. if I can finish it without doing more data collection). She seems to think I have enough data that it's feasible so I am thinking of trying to finish it without enrolling, and then only enrol once the thesis is finished and ready to submit.\n\nI have to be honest and say that I don't actually care about the project anymore. The thing I was doing was supposed to help people in a certain demographic feel more included in society, but now I pretty much don't give a shit if it never sees the light of day. I am only doing it because I want the qualification, because I don't think I should be denied it after doing all that work simply because of other people not doing their jobs properly, and because even in teaching they are starting to require a PhD to teach some of the postgrad-level units.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w34tsd/to_those_of_you_who_quit_their_phd/igvjcdm/"}, "4117": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "eternal-salad", "Date": 1658293313, "Score": -14, "Body": "That\u2019s going above and beyond", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w2xfoj/my_advisor_just_quit/igvo344/"}, "4118": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "The_Woman_S", "Date": 1658294665, "Score": 1, "Body": "Started my MBA when I turned 30.

Burn out is serious and every grad student has felt it in some way or another. If they say they never felt burnt out or a wall they\u2019re lying. Anyone who says that you don\u2019t have many options is wrong- there are always choices.\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way I can tell you what I did when I was dealing with some pretty serious burnout/depression earlier this year - maybe some of it is applicable to you - hopefully :/. Firstly, I told my prof that I needed to take a week off - if you think your PI isn\u2019t going to be understanding then just email them saying you have an emergency to take care of and won\u2019t be around lab for a week (it\u2019s true and they may grumble but tough luck for them). A week isn\u2019t enough time to solve burn out but it helped give me a little energy to make another push. If you think another push isn\u2019t enough to finish the paper - take more time off. I generally produce higher quality work when I come back after a break, maybe you will too.\n\nDuring and after my break I had some long conversations where I vented to my friends and a department admin who is known to be a good listener. I got some great advice about limiting my working hours and forcing some work life balance. It slowed me down in the short term but really helped make me more productive in the long term (after all it slowly pulled me out burnout). If you can\u2019t talk to your friends or an admin about this, consider talking to a therapist. They can provide advice. Grad school isn\u2019t a singular experience that no one understands. It\u2019s a job we take home with us, simple as that. Therapists understand this and can help.\n\nLastly, after I submitted I took another week break. I don\u2019t know about you but I subconsciously forced myself to  not take vacations because there was always something to do. Post paper submission is a great time to hit pause and recharge the ol\u2019 batteries.\n\nIf you feel like grad school isn\u2019t for you, that\u2019s okay too. There are other ways to do what we love but keep in mind, no one loves everything all the time.

That may not apply to the rest of the world, but for what I've heard, it's quite similar if not worse outside.. (for example adding the debt it comes with for a lot of people in USA). And it's an opinion based on my experience and insights after years of talking with people from different fields. I'm an engineer myself with a master's degree and have been pondering the PhD for some time because I admire good researchers.\n\nI think universities programs are not tuned with the necessities of the market. The more time it passes the less communication I see between industry and universities. The institutions are over bureaucratized and full of paperwork that doesn't really make any sense. The outcome is manifold, but it's no good for anybody.\n\nI've met a **lot** of people  struggling  so much after graduating when they discover the job market, that they end up changing career to other things different to the ones they have studied. This is a waste for the society, which is financing a part of the studies in Europe and a frustration for the person that has dedicated time to reach that goal. If that person gets in debt the worse, that's how a new system's slave is born.\n\nUntil 2010s companies used to ask for a lot of degrees and stuff, you needed like a career, 3 MS, a PhD and a PostDoc (I'm being sarcastic) to get a decent job. But, at least in tech industry, this started to change some years ago. There's very motivated people that hasn't gone to the university but have been able to do the industry courses leading to positions that were occupied by engineers before. (An example is Coursera and Google specializations. Change Google, for Amazon and whatever industry monster you prefer). I'm not saying that's bad, I'm happy for the people that can't go through a university to get a nice job. But something weird is happening with the universities. I've done some Coursera courses myself because they end up giving you things that academia doesn't but I thing that it should. Some of the courses are like university subjects themselves, once there's a subject covered by one university in the world, the rest of the universities looses significance. There's very little incentive to get into a university when you can do it online and for a ridiculously lower cost. And not all the universities are transitioning to the new paradigm. The management is worse than poor. I've rejected positions because they enforced me to go physically to the department for things I could do fully online. The salary didn't compensate the fuel, and the worse of all is that the department was willing to let me work online, but the university bureaucracy wasn't ready for that. And still isn't. Shame.\n\nThere's a cost for people doing only online courses only, you can get the position in industry but you're not paid accordingly. So at the end of the day you need university + courses to be able to negotiate a decent salary for the job you're doing. When 30y ago with only the university degree you already were entitled to negotiate. In this regard universities already lost some power.\n\nMost of the teachers I've known are burned out, 8 out of 10 PhD I've known are burned out severely (there's lack of investment and poor paying). And when the PhDs have had some time to breath, in retrospective most of them agrees that their work could be done in half of the time they spent. That's mostly because in departments PhD and PostDoc are the ones doing all the job and they didn't had help. That shouldn't be the case IMHO. You are there to do your research, not to do the maintenance and all the shit your advisor doesn't want to do. And the advisor should help you, instead of  putting more trouble on you.\n\nOn the other hand, people staying too long in academia are very good with abstract concepts but they lack so many productivity skills that the time they take on half of their tasks is ridiculously high. And I'm not blaming them, it's not their fault. They are trained as a researchers not as production people. But I've seen researchers dedicating months/years for something that could be done in days/weeks) just because the system forces them. And most of the time should be the advisor who should hire someone to do the technical job instead of wasting a PhD time to do such things.. But again, there's no $$ for that. Another approach should be production-wise subjects given by universities, I've never understood why there's so much split between the two worlds. Both are necessary.\n\nThere's a last thing that comes from the academia side. There's a lot of researchers publishing things just because it's publishable. News like the ones in Russia from a few years ago, where it came out that a high amount of the papers where copies of other papers, are damaging the institutions. And I've seen that kind of publishing first hand myself. Those that are not poor studies, most are not reproducible. Now I've started to see some people is adding the sources, with the code, and licensing their findings. But those are like 1%. Except of that %, most of the results are not reproducible. So the person publishing has it's merit, but social-wise and industry-wise half the knowledge is lost.\n\nAgain, I'm not blaming anybody. This is like a picture of how I see academia and industry interaction as an outcome. There's a lot of burned out people doing jobs they don't want to but the system enforces them to. Frustration from both sides. Industry keeps taking advantage of some people and academia takes advantage of the rest. Lots of misconceptions, poor outcomes in both sides and a lack of efficiency and efficacy which are so key nowadays with all the crisis we are through.\n\nThose are the reasons why I think universities actually have already lost impact in overall as an institution. I may still have the image of the university as the knowledge and critical thinking place, where some revolutions started in the past. If you compare that kind of institution with nowadays universities, nowadays they are a bit of a joke.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w3o3lj/published_4_journals_more_than_enough_to_graduate/ih1bxdm/"}, "4345": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Sad_Document_8962", "Date": 1658402661, "Score": 1, "Body": "Thanks all!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w41fu8/how_much_are_graduate_students_expected_to_help/ih1byoo/"}, "4346": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Caridor", "Date": 1658403109, "Score": 1, "Body": "That's what worries me.

I don't have resources to share with you but I have a few tips that have helped me :)\n\nFor example, it's always said that it's important to look at the audience. While it's true, there are some people who may not be comfortable looking at someone directly, so you can tend to look at the back of the audience and avoid the front rows. Another thing that I think makes it more dynamic is to alternate looking at the audience with looking at the computer screen and then pointing directly at the screen where the PPT (or whatever) is being projected. I think this works if you are a shy person. \n\nNow, concerning the rehearsing part: I rehearse my presentations as if they were a play I'm about to perform (also, if you can join some drama group, that will do wonders!). I imagine the audicence in front of me and I practise while recording myself, so I can see when I look awkward. I even rehearse what to do with my hands because having a proper body language is imperative and sometimes I can look like a praying mantis if I'm not thinking about it. \n\nHow you finish the talk is also important. You should try to make it very clear that you are done. Try to avoid saying things like \"ehhmm... and that's all I guess\" (I've seen this). Instead, you can find a 'line' that works for you and finish with confidence. For example, I usually say \"and that is all for today!

I think everyone's thesis/dissertation comments and the sheer volume of them is going to be subjectively different for everyone and based a lot on who is on your committee. Furthermore, you have some committees who all see your thesis/dissertation the same and offer similar constructive criticism/feedback and other committee's where all 3 members have very differing opinions and thus, the comments can sometimes be overwhelming. In some cases, you're getting conflicting suggestions. \n2. This is just my opinion, but in the grand scheme of things, who really gives a shit at the quote unquote \"quality of the work\" in regards to the dissertation, especially if you defended and past? I think when you get to the \"date setting\" stage for a dissertation, you can self-reflect and pose the question to yourself of \"do I believe I put in my best effort to write this dissertation?\" The answer should most likely be yes, and if you can honestly say to yourself that you put your blood, sweat, and tears into writing that dissertation to get to the stage of defending, you shouldn't even ponder about the \"quality of the work\" based on reviewer feedback. This is because you know in your heart that you put everything into writing the dissertation to the best of your ability. Furthermore, you assume that your advisor has guided you well enough and given you enough constructive feedback to be well-prepared for the defense. That should be the main focus and most important emphasis point for a advisor, prepare you to defend and pass a dissertation defense. Trying to mitigate every area where some constructive criticism could be raised just seems a little trivial. \n3. I'll also add this last tidbit. I've worked in my institution's writing center for 5.5, going on 6-years in the fall. I've seen dissertations from literally all departments (social sciences, STEM, arts, etc.), pre and post defense. I can tell you, I've seen some absolutely horrid, dog shit dissertations that truly left my mouth on the floor. Like, I didn't even know where to start or begin with the a given tutee when it came to what issues to focus on within our 30-45 minute tutoring session. Issues included, but were not limited to: spelling, punctuation, grammar, APA/MLA citation, citing sources (plagiarism issues), issues with vagueness/specificity, poor organization/outlining of chapter, sections, and information, etc. Despite being a doctoral student in a English-related degree program, I don't think this has anything to do with me potentially being a quote unquote \"grammar nazi.\" At this level (Ph.D), there just a level of writing ability, writing dos and don'ts, and awareness of writing structure/formatting within your own field that I would expect people to have. You would imagine people would develop this keen level of writing knowledge within their 2-years of coursework or certainly during their dissertation writing phase. I'm not expecting people to be the best writer in the world, as I, myself am not and in no way do I expect that from my students I teach or tutees I work with. However, from my experience, I definitely say that there is some differing standards among departments when it comes to writing ability and \"quality\" of dissertations prior and post dissertation defenses.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w4ouih/does_the_number_of_corrections_say_anything_about/ih3wo8l/"}, "4429": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "bitzie_ow", "Date": 1658440144, "Score": 1, "Body": "Those are people with very, very fragile egos.

The city where I am doing my PhD is only about two hours from my hometown; much closer than where I did my undergrad (10 hours away).

However, as my research picked up and COVID lockdowns prevented travel out of the city and banned travel across provincial borders, the visits stopped altogether. With the addition of curfews preventing me from leaving home in the evening, except to come home late from an experiment with an exemption letter in hand, I have lost contact with nearly all of my friends. Now, as COVID lockdowns (and two years) have passed, my friends have gone their own ways. I am happy for them, as they figure out what they want to do and explore new cities and careers. I have been writing my thesis full time for several months now, so I don\u2019t really go into the lab anymore either. Our lab has shrunk down from 10+ members to just 3 of us, and two of us are about to graduate (me and another PhD). They have not been successful in securing a new grant, and the atmosphere of the lab is stressful at the best of times. I really only hang out with my girlfriend.

For example, I had a really hard time with analyzing some recent HPLC data because I didn't understand what the technique was actually doing, so I wasn't seeing the connection between that and my samples. If you don't understand why the hell you're doing the analysis, then you're probs not going to understand how to interpret the data. \n\nAsk yourself the following questions: 1) why am I doing this experiment? what am I trying to find out? 2) based on the answer to #1, how can I find those answers out? what techniques are complementary to my goals? (FTIR, HPLC, NMR, etc.) 3) how does this technique show me what I want to know? i.e- I do polymerization reactions and at the end of them, I want to know how long my chains of RNA are. so, I do HPLC analysis and I get a chromatogram with a bunch of peaks on it- the peaks correlate to oligomer units, and the longer chains take a longer amount of time to come off the column, so the number of peaks correlates to number of units in my oligomer chains. 4) how do my results relate to the original question i asked? for me and my polymerization reactions, im trying out a bunch of conditions and then seeing how long my chains are. so based on the chain length, i can say whether the reaction is being promoted or inhibited, and that's the answer to my initial question. \n\nSo much of my PhD journey has been figuring out the ways that my brain works/processes differently than others. I'd encourage you to view your current predicament not like \"Im incapable of doing data analysis and conceptualization\", but rather that you just need to think about it in a different way so that it clicks for you. For me, I need to know the big, zoomed out picture of what I'm ultimately trying to accomplish before I can get into any of the details. If I don't get the zoomed out big picture, then I will not get any of the small details, and if someone tries to explain the small details to me before I get the big picture, I get lost really easily. \n\nSo anyway, my take on this is that maybe your brain just processes differently and whatever way you're conceptualizing your experiments/results or whatever way they're being explained to you is not conducive to your learning style. You're not dumb, you just haven't figured out what works for you yet. \n\nGood luck OP!!", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/w5dnx4/do_i_have_imposter_syndrome_or_just_a_bad_phd/ih7vlje/"}, "4685": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "skullmarauder", "Date": 1658513032, "Score": 10, "Body": "I just have a year to go.. that\u2019s why I am not giving up.

You can start reaching out to professors you like at your desired universities. Make sure you have done a bit of homework on why they are the profs you want to work with. Read some of their work. You have two years at USC, you can use that time.\n\n2. I know there are Mitacs programs for Canadian internships. You could check that out.\n\n3. You could do a thesis at USC, that gives your thesis advisor a chance to eventually be a referee for you. Or you could do what is known as \u201cdirected studies\u201d with a prof. It is like a thesis, but you do the research only for 1 term and submit a shorter report. Gives the prof a chance to see your research skills and write a reference later. You can also just do really when in a relevant course and that may lead to decent reference, not as good as the other two options.\n\n4. I\u2019d start at 60% completion of your MS.

In truth, the experiment may have been set up slightly incorrectly, this happens ALL the time, to everyone. Next time, instead of wondering if you';re good enough or beaeting yourself up for making a mistake, frame it different. The experiment goes wrong, question why that might be and try an alternative, goes wrong again? Tweak it some more and see what you get. Still getting an unexpected result?

I can definitely relate. From Washington State and in a doctorate program at a university in the state of Pennsylvania (for the last 7-years). Outside of working/studying/living in Japan for 4-years, the furthest west I had ever been in the USA prior to starting my doctorate was Nevada. Even though you may stay in a non-home location for an extended period of time, it may never feel like a place of comfort or homely for that matter. Some things that helped me fight away the homesickness when I first moved here was:\n2. Deck out my room in the exact manner as my room back home. That meant sports/music posters covering every open surface area in my apartment. Furthermore, I have a plethora of Funko Pop figures adorning my desk, book shelves, and dresser. It essentially is my room from back home and by doing this, it brings a little comfort to me that this is indeed home or the closest thing to it. \n3. It sort of unconsciously happened for me, but if you haven't already done so, set up a system to where you speak with your parents and loved ones back home weekly or as often as you need. My family and friends back home have been absolutely instrumental to my mental/psychological and emotional health, as well as getting me to being on the verge of defending my dissertation after 7 long years. My younger sister communicate daily via text messages, memes, videos, and in doing so, it takes my mind off the stresses of grad-school and homesickness. \n4. Really invest in your cohort mates if you haven't already done so. That means helping them out with aspects of coursework, go out for lunch/dinner, and socialize/hangout after class or on weekends. For me, when you no longer have the forced interaction via coursework and your on a deserted island that comes in the form of writing your dissertation, it can be absolutely depressing to be in your room, seeing the sun come up and the sun come down for days/weeks/months on end. This is where building friendships with cohort mates, professors, people within and outside your department come into play. They offer you the emotional support to persevere, vent your frustrations, and fight off homesickness during this very trying time in your life. A professor told me that a doctoral program is very much a \"group effort\" as it is an \"individual\" one and I believe it 100%. If it wasn't for my cohort mates picking me up at different points in my doctoral journey when I was struggling with mental health, depression, imposter syndrome, homesickness, and questioning my own abilities, I would have been swallowed up by my own sorrow and most likely have dropped/failed out of my program. If you have not really developed any friendships in the year you have been in your doctorate program, take part in activities where you would interact and socialize with people. This could come in the form of clubs on campus, Master's thesis/dissertation support groups, or even taking up a job on campus. There's a reason why I've been a writing center tutor for 5.5 years  (going on 6-years in the Fall) at my institution. While I love the job and English is my doctoral program focus, it's the ability to socialize with not just other tutors, but students from the undergraduate to doctoral level. This way, I get out of my stuffy apartment for a few times a week and get the opportunity to interact with other human beings XD\n5. I think it's worth noting that \"getting out of your comfort zone\" and \"getting comfortable with being uncomfortable\" are very valuable life, character, and even occupational skill. There's nothing inherently wrong with living and working in the same environment in which you grew up, but in saying that, there can be drawbacks. Some that come to mind is never feeling the need to change, grow, and adapt, shying away from things that are foreign to you, and feeling discomfort with things that are unfamiliar to you. For me, my time living in Japan, as well as doing my doctorate in a state all the way on the other side of the country from my home forced me to become more independent, advocate for myself, meet new people, and respect viewpoints/ways of life that are different from my own. These new and uncomfortable instances I experienced benefitted me down the line when living and interacting with people in a country that was not my own and whose first language was not my mother tongue. Within academia, developing the skill of \"being comfortable with being uncomfortable\" benefitted me when I taught (and tutored) students at my institution who were multilingual learners, had learning disabilities, were combative, dealing with mental health issues, and had a learning style opposite to my own. On a professional level, this skill helped me when dealing with toxic professors/colleagues as well. \n6. Some advice I'd offer is visit your institution's counseling center and see if talking with one of their psychiatrists/health professionals would be helpful to you. I visited mine when I hit rock bottom in terms of my mental health during my dissertation writing stage and it helped a lot. \n7. If your advisor is somebody you trust and is someone who you feel would be receptive and offer you support during this trying time, I say go for it. He/she may be able to offer you some advice as a person who has also gone through a doctoral program and I'm sure experienced homesickness and loneliness at some point during that time in their life. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/w67aa7/feeling_homesick_but_dont_necessarily_dislike/ihcd47t/"}, "4867": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "I_Poop_Sometimes", "Date": 1658596490, "Score": 5, "Body": "This literally reads like the situation I'm in.

Did your professor and department have an expectation for all their dissertation students to write the chapter within that time frame as soon as you were given dissertation stage approval or leading up to that point, you were expected to be finding relevant literature, reading, synthesizing the material, and essentially writing major sections of your chapter 2?\n\nI mean, at the very least, most people get 2-3 months to write a given chapter, especially chapter 2, as it is the foundation for your study, explains the gap in the literature your trying to fill, and because it's so dense in material.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, I was on the other extreme where it took me 3.5 years to write chapter 2 **solely**  and I'll be defending my dissertation in October. Not only did I feel incredibly behind my cohort mates when writing chapter 2 for that extended period of time, but also the feelings of depression, inadequateness, anger (toward myself and my cohort mates for making successful progress), unnecessary competitiveness, and a feeling of being completely lost. While it ultimately was issues with mental health, chapter 2 was the chapter that almost engulfed me in sorrow and made me fail out during that 3.5 years time frame. I don't know what the eureka moment was, but I got my head out of my ass and I wrote and defended my 3-chapter in 5-6 months after that moment of clarity. Reflecting back on that time, as many people echo, chapter 2 is one of the hardest chapters to write. However, if you can make it past that, it's sort of a snowball effect where you ride that momentum into chapter 3 and 1, which for me personally were significantly easier to write.\n\nI can understand your feelings of feeling rushed, panicked, and feeling behind. I think most people in this sub-reddit would have similar feelings based on your time constraints to submit chapter 2. I personally think it's a herculean task to ask of anyone and incredibly unrealistic, especially to turn in a quality, well written and thought out chapter 2.\n\nI'm not sure if you have any say or sway in establishing your own dissertation chapter deadlines, but what worked for me was being honest with my dissertation advisor on what I was capable of, the type of support I needed, and the parameters that needed to be put in place/accepted for me to be successful and not waste the time of my advisor. That meant, giving me double the amount of time then other dissertation advisees to write a given chapter. How I rationalized it to my advisor was while the input of my advisor and other cohort mates on how long it should take to write a given chapter was appreciated, (**A**) they are not me, (**B**) they don't think and work like I do, and (**C**) as long as I meet the agreed upon chapter deadline and the work is solid, ultimately, who gives a shit how long it takes me to write the chapter. To me, taking a longer chunk of time to write a chapter clearly, concisely, and well was better than feeling rushed to write a chapter and knowing it was either dog shit quality or I miss the chapter deadline altogether, wasting the valuable time of my dissertation advisor.\n\nWhile the dissertation journey has been the furthest thing from smooth and most of my cohort mates have graduated and gone onto their teaching jobs in their respective locations throughout the world, all I can say is \"it's not how you started, it's how you finish.\" It will have taken me until my 7th and final year in the program to finish my degree, which included a lot of very low moments, but I would not trade them for the world or change my journey up to this point because I learned a lot about myself. **I found out how truly mentally tough I actually was**. It not only takes a mentally tough person to see out a doctoral program from start to finish, but to be able to climb out of the pits of despair during the dissertation writing process. I think experiencing feelings of self doubt and worry are pretty normal for doctoral students. The advice I would give you is be kind to yourself, don't dwell on negative thoughts, continually chip away slowly and steadily on your dissertation chapters, and DO NOT compete or compare your progress to that of others.

I came to the decision after working at a company for a year &amp; seeing what the people with PhDs were doing versus what non-PhDs were doing. The ones right out of school were essentially lab techs (in research &amp; development) and to be able to make their own decisions instead of following others\u2019 it would take 6 years to work their way up. So I thought, I can get a phd in that time. Plus I wanted to learn more about things I was more interested in, which I didn\u2019t get with my undergrad degree. \n\nI think to answer some of your other questions, the PhD can be like a job if you\u2019re intentional about making it that way. That is, working 9-5 and some weekends. BUT this is will be a time where you have the most control over your schedule. No boss to approve your PTO. Being in school means that (depending on your advisor) you will be able to take off during holidays, go on vacation whenever you feel like it etc. That for me is a huge perk. If I don\u2019t feel like going to the lab that day, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have to ask anyone I just do it. \n\nAs for social life, mine is great still. Once again you have to be intentional about maintaining it. I have kept friends from high school, college, &amp; made a lot more in grad school. You can gauge how the community is when you visit the school. \n\nMoney: like someone else said, I am in a worse financial position than my friends who didn\u2019t do one. I am unable to save for retirement &amp; don\u2019t have a lot of savings. This of course will be fixed once I graduate and get a job, but it\u2019s still true. However, I was able to buy a condo with my finance as a grad student since I saved up a lot of money. So I am ahead of some people in that sense. We are also able to get married while I\u2019m a student but I have my parents helping us &amp; his too. So I do have that privilege of my money always being mine &amp; not having to pay for kids or my parents or others. \n\nI don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll wanna go to get your PhD but I think you should think about if it\u2019ll help your career or not firstly.

They go for about $150 with the paper notebooks included. You can buy more ink and notebooks on Amazon or directly through the Livescribe website.\n\nEssentially this pen has an audio recorder in its body and a tracker at the pen end of the pen. The special notebooks have paper with tiny dots that the tracker in the pen record when your write over them. That is what enables it to jump to audio pertaining to the exact note you wrote. E.g. If I wrote something 15 minutes and 34 seconds into a meeting but don\u2019t remember what that note is pertaining to, I just tap the start of my sentence in and the audio will jump to 15:34.\n\nYou must plug it in to charge.

She took weeks to get back to me and seem to be disinterested in what I do.\n\nBut when it came to proposal defense time, when I had to apply for awards, or when I was submitting my manuscripts, and even now - when I am close to my dissertation defense; she has been very involved. Her turnaround is two days to a week per dissertation chapter, and she provides a lot of guidance and edits, and sends me resources my way. \n\nHonestly, PhD wasn't what I expected - I thought my advisor would be much more involved, be able to bounce ideas with, guiding me every step of the way. Whether this is a systemic issue or a misperception, what I hand envisioned was not the case.\n\n But now as I looked back, I am grateful that I had the time to figure my way out; came up with a gap in the literature that is worthwhile and significant to explore, and really got me to take ownership of my doctorate. Part of the training is to establish independent thinking and be prepared to be challenged by peers. It really allowed me to see my research that is different from her even though my study is nested in her larger study. She came in when I made substantial headway and challenged me - pushing me to do my best. \n\nI think there's different advisor styles, but if your thesis topic and interest does not align with her expertise or interest, then that can be a red flag, and should be addressed. Because you will need the topical/theoretical/methodological guidance at key milestones. \n\nOne of my friends changed his thesis advisor in second year because the theory and method he was using no longer aligned with his advisor's research.

I think with your GPA, that would give you the best chance to get into a graduate program. Just bust your ass to get good grades and raise that GPA above a 3.0. Like you stated, also build good relationships with professors so they can write you good letters of recommendation and speak on your behalf in regards to your work ethic, intelligence, and potential benefits you bring to a graduate program as a prospective student. While the field you are applying to is significantly more competitive than the Master's program I applied to 10+ years ago (Teaching English as a Second Language, TESOL), I got accepted into my Master's program with a 3.01 undergraduate GPA. I fucked around early on in my undergraduate journey, as well as struggled to adapt to the postsecondary environment without my learning disability accommodations in place. If you're serious about getting into a doctoral program in the future, get your feet wet first within your chosen field by doing a Master's initially. This way, you can potentially have a higher Master's GPA and show potential doctoral programs that you are capable of higher quality academic work. For me, my Master's GPA was a 3.8 and I think it partially showed my doctoral program that I shouldn't be judged on merely my undergraduate GPA, but the growth shown by me as a student and academic with my Master's GPA.

This is a major misconception, and frankly I hate it. A PhD will take up only as much of your life as you give it. You do not have to give your PhD your weekends and evenings. You don't have to miss weddings. You don't have to forgo dates or even having children. You don't need to skip holidays with family. You don't need to skip therapy for that extra hour in lab once a week. You won't be living in a box.   \n\n\nSet boundaries. Make decompressing and relaxation a priority. Learn some health coping strategies. Build some resilient hobbies and habits. Talk about this with everyone and refuse to be shamed by tweaked out lab rats who haven't left the building in 36 hours and think this makes them impressive. Support your colleagues by inviting them to do social things away from your work. You all need it.   \n\n\nAnother misconception is that your PI/ supervisor/ mentor is some kind of god/ messiah/ giver of ultimate validation/ one true deity who controls your success or failure. People hero worship their mentors and then wonder why they leave academia disenchanted and hurt. That's a recipe for disaster. PI's are human. They're really good at their one subject, and only proficient at everything else. They're not usually very good at time management, or team building, or even communication because this wasn't in their training either. They've got a billion demands for their time and usually a little resistance to accepting help from lab managers/ techs/ assistants because they cost money. Don't expect them to turn you into the next great researcher in your field. They don't determine the success/ failure of your projects, the science does. Go to your PI for topical expertise or bureaucratic navigation tips, not life validation and guidance. They're not a career or life coach, do not treat them as one. They can be decent role models, maybe even friends, but it is you who determines the quality of your work, not them. To reiterate again: do not hero worship them.   \n\n\n  \nYou'll probably get imposter syndrome at some point. That's because you're in uncharted territory, not because you're a fraud. If you find yourself feeling like an imposter, you have to find a way to stop, take a step back, look around, and realize you feel lost, because you've gone beyond the map. You're beyond textbooks. You're breaking new ground. You're lost, because you're one of the first people to be doing this stuff. When doing truly novel stuff, everyone looks around and thinks what the hell did I just get myself into, I am not qualified for this. But... you are. That's how you got here. Getting to a PhD doesn't mean you know everything, it means *you're capable of figuring it out eventually*. So when you're lost, take some time to get some perspective and start figuring it out. For me, this means talking to my younger siblings about this stuff. I've got more than 10 years on them, and they think the stuff I do is awesome.

I\u2019m on a fairly high dose (30mg XR daily during the week) and it really helps me stay focused throughout the day. Not to mention I don\u2019t feel absolutely exhausted all of the time, which I hadn\u2019t felt since I was like 12. \n\nPlus it actually REALLY helped with managing my depression and anxiety. I was able to stop taking the SSRI I was previously on for anxiety, which has been great. I\u2019ve found that the adderall helped a lot with social anxiety in particular (I\u2019m also autistic, so social situations can be tough). It helps me feel less stressed about the possibility of \u201cmessing up\u201d in social situations, which I honestly didn\u2019t expect when I first started taking it. Maybe something to do with the rejection sensitivity that comes with ADHD? Overall, it\u2019s really been helpful for my mental health.\n\nProbably the most noticeable thing that adderall does for me is clear the \u201cmental noise\u201d that\u2019s always going on in my head. Off my meds I tend to get songs stuck in my head on loop, have trouble maintaining one train of thought for long, get confused because I\u2019m thinking about 10 things at once etc. On my meds, it\u2019s much easier to follow a train of thought through to the end because there\u2019s not a bunch of random thoughts fighting for my attention. It\u2019s kind of hard to describe and I honestly didn\u2019t realize it was happening until I started taking my meds. \n\nThe mood swings you mentioned you were worried about did happen to me a little when I started on the lowest dose of adderall instant release. I found that extended release and a higher dose pretty much eliminated that side effect for me. I know some folks have better reactions to Ritalin or vyvanse as well. There are a lot of options out there and a good psychiatrist will help you find what works best for you.\n\nThere are a couple of other side effects I had to learn to manage, but nothing that has really hurt me long term. For example, I found that instant release adderall wasn\u2019t for me (gave me mood swings when it wore off, anxiety). But switching to XR solved that. There are some side effects that still affect me, but they\u2019re super manageable (ex: adderall xr messes with my appetite a fair amount so I have to be really careful about scheduling meals or I\u2019ll just power through the day without eating enough.) Working with a good psychiatrist who has experience with adhd in adults has made finding the meds that work for me fairly easy.\n\nPersonally, the process of figuring out which adhd meds work for me was totally worth it. I\u2019m much happier, more mentally healthy and a more organized, effective student on my adhd meds. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s just my experience.

Here\u2019s more context for mine, sorry if it\u2019s a bit long-\n\nGot in to top-ish school on other side of the country from which I am from. Committed. Went early (June as opposed to Sept). Immediately joined a lab as my PI had recruited me. LOVED my lab, the PI, the science. Did not make a single friend or connection outside of my dept (really only my labmates). Struggled with homesickness. Struggled with culture shock. Suffered socially and mentally for 8 months. It seeped into my lab work. Many a broken glassware, couldn\u2019t concentrate, all that. Tried therapy, didn\u2019t work. That\u2019s when I made the decision that, while I absolutely adored everything about that entire lab, I couldn\u2019t let the rest of me suffer. Even if I loved it.\n\nSo I told my PI (tears fell during that meeting lol). He was incredibly supportive. Helped me find labs and schools back home that may interest me. Moved back home between fall and spring semester and took a break the next couple of months. Applied to PhD programs during this time. Some, I had applied to last round. Others were new options. \n\nSome had initially accepted me but denied me the second round. Others accepted both times. I ended up at a school that I\u2019d only applied to during the second round. I felt that the atmosphere aligned much more with my personality, interests, and attitude towards science. Had to start over essentially (could only transfer 1 credit). Here at my current institution, I didn\u2019t get placed in my top choice lab, which hurt for awhile, but I still felt like I belonged. I grew to love the science that I do. I have friends here. My labmates are great. My PI matches my work ethic/etc. Things fell into place.\n\n\nMy takeaway advice: Figure out what\u2019s most important to you in life and frame your decision around that. For me it was: holy shit I love science and I am fascinated by my work, but I want to be able to have connections, relationships, and hobbies outside lab too. And I don\u2019t want to make half of me suffer even if another piece of me is thriving. (Not knocking anyone that puts their work at the forefront, it just isn\u2019t for me). \nTalk to people. \nListen to your gut. \nYou know what is best for you.

I, myself, have a core group of friends that are made up of people within and outside my own cohort. I not only have cherished the general friendship, but having a group of people who personally know the stresses and emotional toll that dissertation writing can take on a person, have allowed me to vent to at numerous times, and have given me important opinions on various matters has been invaluable. \n\nI think you definitely shouldn't be hard on yourself because you were the one initiating hangouts, get togethers, and overall, just general social get togethers. At the end of the day, you can't put a gun to people's heads and tell them to hangout if they don't want to. I saw so many people within my own program who had tunnel vision and just never saw the value in building authentic relationships or interacting with other doctoral students if it didn't relate to coursework and academics. I understand some of them had family obligations, worked multiple jobs, and had other responsibilities I didn't have as a single male with no children. However, it was these same people who found themselves very isolated down the line when there was no longer the forced interaction that came in the form of coursework and now they were on an island by themselves when dissertation writing time came around. They really had nobody to socialize with, turn to for academic emotional support, and because of that, it added to the emotional toll they felt when finishing up their doctoral studies. \n\nAs a last point, while you couldn't have the comradery that you yearned for in your doctoral program, I think it's something that you should continue to push for and initiate moving forward when you look for a future teaching position or whatever future occupation you choose.

So I've presented at conferences in the fields of generative language acquisition, general linguistics, comparative literature/modern languages, TESOL, language testing and assessment, and so on. There are annual conventions of societies or associations that can get long and there is no need at all to stay for the entire duration, let alone come early. They often have workshops and SIG (special interest group) meetings after or before the conference, and so you could stay if you're interested. Some conferences in neighboring fields sometimes run consecutively or simultaneously, which can come handy. If I stay for a couple of days, I pretty much only stay at Airbnb close to the venue. It's often cheaper and networking doesn't really suffer. If it's not a huge conference with thousands of people attending, but a small workshop which is just my small field, I do definitely stay for the entire duration.\n\nI was very hyped to present at my first conference, and attended a whole lot of sessions on a whole lot of topics -- since it was an annual meeting of a big society and I was the only one from my field presenting. After quite a few presentations, for one big international thing this year I just flew in to Pittsburgh in the morning, attended two panels, gave a talk at noon, and flew out in the evening. It really depends on the conference and what you want to get out of it. For me it's either meeting with colleagues, or making new connect, or just conveying an idea to a new population whose work I am not necessarily interested in. E.g., if I would like to convey my findings or a theory from one of the fields I work in to another whereas general populations of these fields rarely interact.

I would say anywhere from 0 to 2000 chf. Going out is sort of expensive. I can speak to my budget and some general costs. \n\nRent for my studio is around 1200 per month. My phone and internet come to 100, and my health insurance (a student special insurance and not the general one everyone has, though it has the same coverage) is another 100. My monthly Zurich travel pass is under 100 per month. \n\nI personally use many of the most expensive grocery options (Partly through laziness/for convenience and partly for quality/getting hard to find items) so say I spend maybe 700 per month on groceries. You can definitely reduce this number by day a factor of 2. Note that I am mostly vegetarian so these prices can also easily go up a lot since meat here is very expensive. \n\nApart from that, it\u2019s up to you. A meal out for two (like a date) can easily be 50 to 70 per person with (a glass of) wine. The cheapest dinners are still around 25 tk 30 (ignoring fast food and D\u00f6ner and whatnot). Cocktails are around 15 to 20 chf each. Labor costs here are a lot since most workers get livable wage, so anything that requires service is expensive. \n\nBut things like hiking or using many of the outdoor grills in the forests are free and can be done with friends cheaply (basically paying only for food and beer and like some charcoal for grill). Ski lift passes here are cheap compared to US but accommodations in ski areas won\u2019t be so cheap. Train tickets to nearby places can be as low as $10 (with a half fare travel card which for me is a benefit from the university) and farther (say Zurich to a ski resort) 45 to around 75 (the cost of an all-Switzerland day travel pass with half fare travel card). \n\nYou can see how the doing things part can be cheap if you love hiking and outdoors stuff to very expensive if you are someone who likes going out to trendy places for drinks and food.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/wawnqx/how_high_in_general_is_a_phd_candidate_salary_in/ii5n19g/"}, "6186": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "AutoModerator", "Date": 1659117682, "Score": 1, "Body": "This post is flaired as \"Need Advice\".

Make sure your advisor has the right mentorship style for you and has an understanding of your goals and priorities. Check-in each year about goals with your advisor. Talk to professors and find mentors who accept and help and don't judge. Most people struggle to make friends first year and feel left out - know that it's normal. Find ways to socialize on your own terms - so if happy hour is tough to make, just invite someone to meet up to eat bagged lunch together on campus. Co-working sessions can be great for communing and accountability and can be done remotely. My school has an activism group for students with children, but people also use that group to find other student parents and make friends. I was actually a part of this group as a non-parent student. A lot of non-parent and parent students share the same insecurities (e.g., feeling like we're falling behind, have a strained relationship with advisor, feeling isolated, etc) so this is where my suggestions are coming from.\n\nGood luck though!

He described the material as not hard, but the sheer amount overwhelmed him daily. They also made him take these practice board exams that he was expected to pass, otherwise he would be dismissed from the program.

Usually it's taken out of your paycheck. These scholarships neither pay IRS (if you have other income, this income doesnt count, although you do have an exclusivity clause, but there are some ways around it and exceptions).\n\nIf you do decide to be in SS, the FCT (the national body that gives out 95% of portuguese scholarships), will pay you an aditional 130\u20ac a month, basically, which covers the costs of the minimum voluntary SS program. So while you'll never get more net money, you can have more rights and benefits if you opt for this. You can pick the minimum program, entirely covered by the FCT, or choose to pay more to also have more benefits. Essentially it is a 130\u20ac raise that you have conditional of choosing to be in SS.\n\nTuition usually rounds 2k\u20ac (the state pays the rest, although here they're also paying it via scholarship lol), and your budget will be 2750\u20ac.

From what you describe everyone in a similar situation would feel the same pressure as you do. Unfortunately, the picture you draw is an awful familiar one, I\u2019ve seen so many PhDs getting into a state that is just one inch away from a burnout. \n\n\rIf I were you I would focus on two things: get your workload sorted out and seek professional help. Obviously you have a lot on your plate and you are close to finishing your PhD contract. I think it would be a good idea to meet with your PI/supervisor, and provide an exhaustive list with all the things you still need to do. It is your PI\u2019s job to manage your workload and prioritize your task such that you reach your ultimate goal: finishing your PhD thesis. Adopt a good-enough approach mindset and focus on the tasks that are absolutely necessary to successfully complete your PhD. Again, your PI should help you with that. Get rid of all unnecessary tasks, e.g. I would skip going to conferences to be honest. Together with your PI, make a priority ranking of your tasks in such a way that they are actually feasible to accomplish. By that I mean you should still be in a mentally good state afterwards. Then agree with your PI on when exactly you will work on the individual tasks. Meet regularly to reflect on how well this is going. If you have a difficult relationship with your PI, maybe it will help to first meet with a different supervisor to discuss the necessary tasks and then confront your PI with your plan together. If this isn\u2019t an option I would think about confronting HR if possible.\n\n\rSecond, from your description it seems like you are in a difficult psychological state and I would really advise you to seek help. Cognitive behavioral therapy can give you an enormous boost to your mental health and stabilize you enough to make it through the last part of your PhD in a healthy mental state. To be honest, I find this point way more important than anything else. Never, ever, put your PhD above your own health. It\u2019s just not worth it, trust me! Nobody will later come to you and say: \u201cThank you for sacrificing your sanity! I read your PhD thesis and it absolutely changed the world.\u201d If you don\u2019t have access or financial support to adopt therapy then ask around your institute/university for what they offer.\n\n\rI hope this somehow helps, I wish you all the best!

When I started thinking about my undergrad classes through the lens of potential future research directions or skills that I could apply in the lab, everything just clicked for me in a way that it didn\u2019t when I was thinking about medicine.

Many students apply to 20-30 schools, and many won\u2019t get a single acceptance. If you don\u2019t have a good chunk of money saved up, the application cycle itself could financially break you.

I went PhD, here\u2019s why. Note I\u2019m 5 years in, and my S/O is 1 year into Med school, so I have *some* exposure to both sides. \n\n1: My interest in the field is driven more by curiosity than it is by anything else. I would love learning about medicine and I enjoy helping people, but it wouldn\u2019t quite scratch the right itch. Research also can provide more autonomy and variety over your field of study even if you do research as an MD. \n\n2: Costs. PhDs tend to be fully funded, I\u2019m not swimming in money, but I make enough to live contently in a large city. I can save so when I needed a new car and a new computer I got fairly expensive choices. Yes, it\u2019s ~6 years at that pay. It\u2019s ~100k/year net gain over Med school. Yes you get out in 4 years, but then you have residency where you don\u2019t really get paid much anyway. Considering residency may last longer than the PhD by the end of a theoretically residency you could already be making PhD salary.\n\n3: I hate being overworked, and a PhD career is by no means light, but an MD/DO is top tier workload. I could do it but it wouldn\u2019t make me happy. PhD can also come with more flexibility in schedule and lifestyle, for example my PI comes in 10-4 then works from home 6-9 so he can drop off and pick up his kids from daycare. It can\u2019t be understated how valuable a job that works with the life you want is. \n\n4: I initially was thinking job security would be vastly better as an MD/DO. My opinion hasn\u2019t changed, but I think PhD in Biomed or related fields have pretty good options, given how well funded medical research is and how much money private industry has to through at people. While associate professors are more common, tenure is also the gold standard for job security if you can get there. \n\n5: It isn\u2019t just about what your life looks like after. You\u2019re giving like 5-10% of your life to be a fully fledged PhD or MD/DO. Your quality of life in that time isn\u2019t inconsequential. I would rather be a PhD student with more flexible work hours, a salary, and lighter classes, than a Med Student studying or doing rotations 12 hours a day who has negative money to spend on themselves.

Obviously you have to be voted into a particular position within the organization (secretary, Vice President, president, social media coordinator, etc.), but by joining the organization, you can organize a variety of events on behalf of your department that benefit your department, it students, and the greater university. For example, organizing guest speakers to give talks on a particular topic related to your field, potlucks/social gatherings where students and professors from the department mingle/hangout, and organizing workshops for your department or general students regardless of major. This could be on a very specific topic related to your field or a workshop that can help fellow doctoral students (Ex. common challenges for graduate students, avoiding plagiarism/patch writing, completing your dissertation successfully, writing your literature review, or effective research practices, etc.).\n2. If you're looking for a job and are up to it, join your university's writing center as a tutor. You could really emphasize the fact that your a person who believes that **diversity** is the norm and there's no better example of that than the students who walk through the writing center door and you have to help. You see and tutor students of all academic levels (undergraduate, Master's, and doctoral), writing levels (insecure to confident in their writing ability, from varying academic departments, and students from all different backgrounds (multilingual learners, students with learning disabilities, etc.). Due to these experiences and insight you would gain from tutoring, you could/will create workshops (PowerPoint presentations) that target the needs of not just students within your own department, but the needs of students regardless of major/department based on what you have seen. As a writing center tutor at my institution for 5.5 (going on 6-years in the Fall), some of the most popular workshops I've given personally at my writing center or at a professor's classroom include: communicating with professors, APA citation, MLA citation, peer review, proofreading, and resume and CV workshop.

Just like physics helps you understand how an airplane is kept in the air, it is a way bigger subject that encompasses much more than just airplanes and so is biology way bigger than medicine, which only scratches the tiniest portion of the study of life.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/wbmew0/to_the_stem_phds_out_there_have_you_ever/ii9z6us/"}, "6623": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "sadgrad2", "Date": 1659200771, "Score": 8, "Body": "This is the correct answer, not for your application, but in reality", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/wc0llw/how_can_a_phd_student_contribute_to_its/iia03xj/"}, "6624": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Yestodayy12", "Date": 1659200889, "Score": 3, "Body": "Please look at @OhjoOm response. \n\nI\u2019d like to add to it since you sound like me a couple of months ago.\n\nBy your description OP your psychological well-being is poor right now.

I worked in a doctors office as a nurse aide, and it was very frustrating to me when patients didn\u2019t \u201clisten\u201d. I consider myself a compassionate person, and it was really making it challenging to extend compassion when a patient would have an issue, the doctor would recommend a solution, and they would just not do it. \n\nSecond is I had an issue with death. I worked for a doctor who specialized in geriatrics and I learned I really love the elderly. They\u2019re fun to talk to, and I have a soft spot for them. At the same time, when we would lose a geriatric patient, I took it really hard. On the same note, I had to perform CPR on someone in public once, and I wasn\u2019t successful in resuscitating her.

The part of being a physician that involves actually seeing patients (a relatively small part) is very much like customer service. Most of the time you are not saving lives, you are managing someone's diabetes or removing their gallbladder and just hoping that they actually take their medications as prescribed. Most physicians spend way more time writing notes, putting in orders, talking on the phone, and arguing with insurance companies than seeing patients, and I've never met a single doctor who said that that part of the job is rewarding in the slightest. At least in the US, doctors (and insurance companies lol) are also taking on a greater gatekeeping/paternalistic role in society. Also, unless you are a neurosurgeon, the job of a physician is extremely formulaic. Patient has these symptoms, so you order this bloodwork and imaging, and if it shows this then that means this. Sounds kind of boring to me. \n\nI like being a scientist because there really is no formula to doing what I do. Every complex I work with behaves differently and I can't go read a textbook to know what to do with it because no one has ever done it before. \n\nAlso, I agree with others that a lot of your comments are condescending to PhD's, whether you actually intend that or not. Many, MANY PhD's in biomedical sciences work hand in hand with physicians (again, most notably in neuroscience) and the therapies that they develop are being tried in actual patients right before their eyes. You seem to have this idea that the only way to directly help people in medicine is by being a doctor, which is offensive to PhD's whose work absolutely does directly and tangibly help people. Doing a PhD, doing an MD, being a scientist, being a physician, it's all extremely challenging and selective and trying to say which one is harder or more valuable is apples and oranges. You're leaning toward medicine, so go with that, don't look back, and respect the hell out of the PhD's you'll meet along the way.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/wbmew0/to_the_stem_phds_out_there_have_you_ever/iibiohn/"}, "6769": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "zacinthebox", "Date": 1659225382, "Score": 4, "Body": "Just basing it on how reactive you\u2019ve demonstrated yourself to be when faced with even mildly critical input and feedback to your question.\n\nBest of luck with whichever academic and professional endeavor you choose", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/wbmew0/to_the_stem_phds_out_there_have_you_ever/iibitek/"}, "6770": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "gomitas2000", "Date": 1659225774, "Score": 37, "Body": "I dealt with anxiety and panic attacks during the 4 months previous to submission of the final draft.

Professional Development for a department should emphasize the need to create and nurture a healthy work environment for all, that includes tenured and non-tenured faculty, as well as staff. They should also address the elephant in the room and maintain that toxic and bully-like behavior will not be tolerated. I'm not sure if this is a factor in a committee's decision to offer tenure to a faculty member or not while on the tenure-track, but how well a faculty member positively interacts and assimilates themselves within a department should be taken into account. In saying that, some people are absolute academy award actors when it comes to wearing that mask and putting on a front until they've secured tenureship (aka. power and leverage).\n2. This second point is a bit of a rant but make faculty members aware that there is not an academic forcefield to protect you when you leave your institution's grounds. I feel in the case of some faculty, they falsely assume that their position, accolades, and level of education (**1**) sanctions them to get away with talking down to people (students, faculty members, staff), and (**2**) that they are immune or free of personal criticism and punishment from individuals they perceive to be beneath them (students, non-tenured faculty). Being in the realm or environment of academia for so long as doctoral students and faculty also (**3**) plays a part in the development of an inflated sense of self-worth or self-importance for these individuals. I think the issue I'm trying to get at here is some faculty can't turn that **button off** and continue in some cases to think they can act that way when they leave the academic environment and enter other social domains. Educators always bring up the point that students, now more than ever, are incredibly diverse, come from many different backgrounds, and teachers should take note of this. Newsflash, this includes students from very poor socioeconomic backgrounds, people from \"the hood,\" and people who have had very different upbringings to many of these academics at these institutions (gang violence, environments where the murder rate is high, poverty, etc.). Being respectful goes a long way in those socioeconomic environments (keeps you alive), as well as in most environments. However, to be clear, if a teacher recklessly comes at a student on that BS, talking sideways (disrespectfully) without knowing the true extent of a student's background, again, there really is nothing preventing an individual from putting hands on you or slapping the taste out of your mouth. I ain't from the hood, and don't condone this type of behavior, but the way I've been addressed on a few occasions while at the grocery store or at a restaurant (as a doctoral student) by some faculty within my department in passing definitely made me want to give them a piece of my mind.", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/wcfd2f/phdacademia_is_toxic_how_do_we_break_the_cycle/iicjr9k/"}, "6833": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "polardrag", "Date": 1659245880, "Score": 1, "Body": "Did you mean LinkedIn connection??", "Permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/wbtjh3/as_a_phd_candidate_or_holder_what_is_the_one/iiclppb/"}, "6834": {"Subreddit": "PhD", "Author": "Decisionsota", "Date": 1659245953, "Score": 1, "Body": "Sure.

That's not how it should work, but it's been my observation that's the truth. \n\nMy issues weren't exactly LD related (although I was in special Ed part time in middle school) but the fact that I'm rather hearing impaired. I'm in a STEM field, and found that my institution essentially classified all the time I'm doing research - AKA the most important and time intensive part - in some kind of ADA grey zone. Student services claimed they could only help with literal classroom time. HR claimed they could only help with the time that I was literally working as a TA. So nobody was responsible for my lab time. \n\nSo it came down to my PI - who hated me and resented that the department placed me in their lab - and the department chair - who was (apparently) very busy looking for their next job. The department chair asked if perhaps I shouldn't leave the program before they'd investigated a single accomodation. \n\nLiterally all I was looking for was a quiet desk across the hall from our very loud lab, as being in lab was very hard on my cochlear implant and the PI instead we be in lab 9-6 daily, even if we were reading or writing.
